when i got a dvd of this from netflix only to see the introductory , `` this film has been modified from its original version . it has been formatted to fit this screen . '' i was incensed . there is no way that i wanted to watch a truncated version when a wide screen version was available . in addition to the formatting issue , the film quality was not good . so , i bought a criterion collection blu-ray disc and was happy that i did . not only did it have the aspect ratio of the original film version , but also the film quality was pristine . this latter is important , since a great deal of the enjoyment of viewing this movie is to appreciate the artistry of the high contrast black and white filming . i think this was a truly collaborative effort between director laughton , screenwriter agee , and cinematographer stanley cortez -- it is hard to know which of these three deserves the most credit . besides its technical excellence the criterion collection -lrb- produced in 2010 -rrb- has enough extras to overwhelm even the most ardent fan . there is a 2008 commentary track with four people who seemed to be most interested in one-upping each other -- i found their commentary to be of minimal value . there is a 38 minute documentary on the making of the film as well as a fourteen minute segment containing interviews with robert mitchum , shelly winters , lilian gish and others . there is a fourteen minute 1984 interview with stanley cortez that proves that he had no small ego . the clip that i found most interesting was a 2010 interview with simon callow who gives some informative insights into charles laughton and how you can see why he was drawn to directing this . there is a two-and-a-half hour compilation of outtakes . these show multiple takes of many of the scenes and get to be a little tedious . interesting to see the dialog between laughton and the actors though . i first saw this when i was young and saw it primarily as a thriller with sinister pursuing the two young kids to find out where they were hiding money . on that first viewing i missed out on a lot of more complex themes i found from recent viewing . i think this should get a pg-13 rating , since any kid under thirteen might have nightmares for a few days after viewing . robert mitchum gives a remarkable performance as the sociopath preacher harry powell . anyone who has seen this will remember the love/hate tattoos on powell 's fingers and the early scene where his hands fight it out between love and hate . this scene sets the tone of the contrasts in the movie : love/hate , good/evil , black/white , young/old , . i think powell is one of the most unusual characters ever seen on screen . i could not figure to what extent he was in any sense a man of the lord . he would speak to the lord , even when alone , but was he really believing this , or was he mocking the practice ? in any case the lord would take a dim view of his penchant for killing and robbing widows . a thing that came across strongly in second viewing was powell 's sexual hangups . his switchblade is used as a symbol for his manhood -- in one scene , as he stoically watches a sexually suggestive dance , his switchblade clicks open , jutting out to cut a hole in his pocket . on his wedding night he refuses sex and in a later scene , when one of the pursued children wants to look at his knife , he shouts , `` do n't touch my knife ! '' powell is one screwed up dude . shelly winters does well as a naive , sex-starved mother that powell preys on . this is similar to the role winters would play in `` lolita . '' the two kids are good enough , but are not as natural as many child actors of recent times . in one of the extras laughton is seen directing them and we see that it was not an easy task . neither of the kids went on to acting careers . this is an unforgettable one of a kind movie .		10		1
when jittery advertising executive neal page -lrb- steve martin -rrb- is trying to go home for thanksgiving , he gets stuck with boorish shower ring salesman del griffith -lrb- john candy -rrb- . their experiences over the next two days are some of the funniest moments ever to grace the silver screen . the best parts are the `` pillow '' scene , the car rental scene , and the freeway scene -lrb- warning : you may very well laugh yourself to death -rrb- . but overall , the reason that the movie is so good is because we come to understand why these two men are like they are . i ca n't do `` planes , trains & automobiles '' justice by trying to describe it . you have to see it to understand how hilarious it is . you wo n't have a dull moment in it .		10		1
the world 's end is an excellent and hilarious film that greatly mixes sci-fi , action , comedy along with amazing direction , a terrific cast , brilliant laughs and humor , a fantastic script , thrilling action and is a great conclusion to edgar wright 's cornetto trilogy . set in the united kingdom , the world 's end tells the story of gary king -lrb- simon pegg -rrb- , an alcoholic who tracks down his former high school best friends andy -lrb- nick frost -rrb- , steven -lrb- paddy considine -rrb- , oliver -lrb- martin freeman -rrb- and peter -lrb- eddie marsan -rrb- and wants them to complete the golden mile and go to twelve pubs including one called the world 's end and have lots of beers . but the group 's plans are interrupted when they have to deal with killer robots who replace humans . now , gary and his friends have to stop the killer robots while still trying to get to ... the world 's end . the world 's end is an amazing and truly hilarious movie that is the third and finale film in edgar wright 's three flavors cornetto trilogy that began with the first film shaun of the dead , the second film hot fuzz and now with the third and final film the world 's end , a movie that is probably the largest and most ambitious of the three films and also has the trilogy go out with an explosive , funny and over the top bang . if shaun of the dead was a send-up on zombie films and hot fuzz was a spoof on action movies then the world 's end is a movie that tackles science fiction . right from the very beginning the world 's end is a film that pulls into an unforgettable experience that is funny , wild and full of great energy and a film that is bizarre and in a world on it 's own where you do n't what is going to happen next and you as a viewer are along for the ride . the comedy and laughs in this film is hilarious and fun whether it is from the characters , the dialog or situations that happen throughout the film and the laughs and jokes in the movie are done with great wit and creativity that is memorable and fresh as well as non-stop . what i love about twe is how the first 20-30 minutes of the film is about a group of old friends reuniting and drinking at pubs but later takes a turn when the sci-fi element comes into play . the way edgar wright tackles the sci-fi genre is hilarious and ingenious with twe making great references to science fiction films from the 1970s such as invasion of the body snatchers and the stepford wives while at the same time establishing it 's own world and rules . the sci-fi in this film is handled with an oddball and weird sense of humor and is done with style and substance that is dazzling with madcap fun that goes on and on . the screenplay by simon pegg and edgar wright is brilliant and is filled with great dialog and humor that never misses and beat and will have you roaring with laughter and in stitches . if the character shaun in shaun of the dead was an unlikely hero that had no ambitions and nicolas angel in hot fuzz was too serious about his job as a police officer , then the character gary king in the world 's end is a guy that is in a funny way trying to relive his teenage years with his friends . gary is a hilarious and interesting character because despite being a struggling alcoholic gary still wants to hang with his friends and complete the mission by trying to get to the pub the world 's end and wants to do it even if there are killer robots after him and his friends . the relationship between gary and his friends is funny and feels real because although gary has n't seen his friends in over 20 years and gary 's friends have problems with gary himself the group all care about each other especially when they have to deal with dangerous killer robots . the killer robots in this film are truly psychotic , wild and funny all at once because they come in big numbers and want to take over the world no matter what happens and when gary and his friends confront and fight the robots many scenes and situations are unpredictable and insane and you never know where the film is going to go . the action and fight scenes in twe are amazing and exciting and will have you in awe because with each action scene there is a great pace , thrill and attention to detail in each scene that edgar wright does really well . the action scenes are brilliant , nonstop and will just blow your mind . the ending of twe is excellent , explosive and will have you on the edge of your seat mixing laughs and over the top sci-fi insanity that will stick with you after watching . the ending is a outstanding conclusion to this film and to the entire three flavors of cornetto trilogy and will have you cheering and smiling . the whole cast is great in their roles . simon pegg is excellent and hilarious as gary king , with pegg bringing great laughs and a manic energy to the role . nick frost is brilliant and funny as andy , with frost going against type and playing the role straight while still being funny . paddy considine -lrb- steven -rrb- , martin freeman -lrb- oliver -rrb- and eddie marsan -lrb- peter -rrb- do great jobs as gary and andy 's friends . rosamund pike is fantastic as sam , oliver 's sister and steven 's longtime crush . pierce bronson is wonderful in his small role as guy shephard , gary 's old schoolteacher . the direction by edgar wright is brilliant and stylish , with wright always moving the camera with a great pace , style and over the top energy while also doing a great job with the action and fight scenes . amazing direction , wright . the score by steven price is great , intense and fits in well with the film 's action . a wonderful score , price . in final word , if you love edgar wright , simon pegg , nick , comedy , action , shaun of the dead , hot fuzz or genre films in general , i highly suggest you see the world 's end , an excellent and hilarious that you wo n't soon forget . highly recommended . 10/10 .		10		1

`` love in the afternoon '' is one of my favorite billy wilder movies . it 's funny , romantic , and can even bring tears to your eyes . audrey hepburn gives one of her best performances as does gary cooper . and yes , there is a big age difference . but who could resist gary cooper or audrey hepburn , so naturally they ca n't resist each other . and the both of them are perfect in their roles , so i ca n't even imagine any one else playing those parts . if you 're a billy wilder , audrey hepburn , or gary cooper fan , you definitely ca n't miss this movie . even if you 're not a fan of any of them , it 's still an enjoyable classic that has n't lost its charm after 40 years . i give `` love in the afternoon '' a very enthusiastic 10 out of 10 !		10		1
i once read that it 's a wonderful life is the holiday gift for all time . never a truer statement has been made about one of the most popular films to have ever been made . the plot is a simple one that has since been regurgitated and trundled out almost yearly it feels like . james stewart plays george bailey , an all round swell fella , who because of a number of life 's circumstances finds himself forever a resident of bedford falls . here he is the principal guy in the running of the family building & loan business . when a substantial amount of money goes missing during the run up to christmas , bailey finds himself at the mercy of family nemesis , and nefarious town banker , mr. potter -lcb- lionel barrymore -rcb- . but george , tipped over the edge by an incident involving the bank funds , has an idea that taking his own life would greatly improve the fortunes of his family and the family business . but as he stands at the precipice of death by suicide , george is saved by his guardian angel clarence -lcb- henry travers -rcb- and given the chance to see what bedford falls would be like having not had george bailey 's influence . few , if any , directors have rivalled frank capra when it comes to successfully portraying the human heart on screen . it 's a wonderful life is capra 's masterpiece . rightly so , it is unashamedly sentimental , but also it 's rich with the directors faith in community spirit and a belief in the strong bond of family love . the story is loosely worked from `` the greatest gift , '' a phillip van doren stern story that he had sent to his friends as a christmas card . aided on screen writing duties by frances goodrich & albert hackett -lcb- dalton trumbo is in there sometimes too -rcb- , capra fashioned an ultimate feel good movie that is flecked by sheer darkness and disconcerting `` life is tough '' undertones . it 's most likely that the more dark side of the film , and the wait for christmas cheer , is what made it 's a wonderful life a flop on its release . the film made a huge loss , tho not quite as gargantuan as many today believe , and was quickly consigned to the forgotten bin . but annual yuletide repeats on television over the following decades garnered it a cult following . a cult following that eventually swelled to a near universal one , to the point that now christmas just would n't be the same without it . it is by definition , the ultimate comeback movie . tho all the cast are superb -lcb- special mention to donna reed as george 's wife , mary -rcb- it 's stewart who leads the way in the class stakes . as he drifts from homely , lovable dreamer , a man sacrificing those dreams for others to benefit . to his descent into despair and the undertaking of a nightmarish odyssey , stewart captivates in every frame , and more telling is that he is believable with each transformation of george 's state of mind . however , when all is said and done , it 's with the ending that basically the film rewards those who have trusted in capra and jimmy . it 's an ending warm enough to melt the coldest of hearts . so see it with someone you love -lcb- always nice to have someone else to cry with -rcb- or introduce it to the poor souls who have n't seen it yet . either way , it 's here to stay forever the timeless classic that it so most certainly is . 10/10		10		1
a very young christian bale stars as jim graham in `` empire of the sun '' . based on the novel by j.g. ballard , it is the story of an english boy struggling to survive under japanese occupation in wwii . the cast of `` empire of the sun '' deliver extremely strong performances . a pleasant surprise can be found in the foreign languages spoken throughout the film -- although i had no idea what was being said , i got a general impression thanks to the way the lines were said . christian bale 's character undergoes a drastic transformation due to his wwii experiences -lrb- but his dream of flying a plane remains consistent -rrb- , and observing this transformation on screen is just amazing . bale gives one of the best child actor performances in a film to date . an interesting thing throughout `` empire of the sun '' is the portrayal of the japanese . their part in the war is rarely touched on in wwii movies -- after all , nazis and their persecution of jews provides a more `` interesting story '' . although the japanese are unmistakably `` the enemy '' , at times one feels great empathy for them , particularly the kamikaze pilots jim admires . one fascinating character is a -lrb- chinese , i think -rrb- boy about jim 's age , who , too , dreams of flying . the difference between the two is this : the chinese boy is free ; he eventually joins with the japanese as a pilot . the boy has practically no speaking interaction with jim , and yet , the two characters are powerfully contrasted -lrb- i will avoid my bad habit of here -rrb- . john williams composes yet another fascinating score . a welsh lullaby -lrb- called `` suo gan '' , according to ian freer in his book `` the complete spielberg '' -rrb- features quite prominently in the music , and its use is perfectly timed . the first time it 's used , it 's just a hilarious opportunity to watch christian bale lip-sync the song -lrb- faltering every once in a while , which is practically inevitable -rrb- . but its subsequent usage becomes extremely powerful , as one remembers just what kind of boy jim was when he first sang it in the film . the music 's haunting melody is something that will probably stay with the audience long after the film is done . call me biased if you like , but i really admire spielberg 's direction . `` empire of the sun '' is filled with heart-wrenching moments without launching into bathos . spielberg makes some really clever directing choices . for instance , the first time we meet basie -lrb- john malkovich -rrb- , who becomes something of a father figure to jim , spielberg does n't show his face in full . it is always somewhat blocked by the shadows . even when he goes out into the streets , he wears sunglasses , so we can not see his eyes . this deliberate mysteriousness pays off , as it serves to spice up the audience 's interest in this new character . i wo n't really describe the plot -lrb- which , to be honest , is amazing -rrb- , because this is a film not worth spoiling . this is a little treasure . `` empire of the sun '' just about flopped at the box office , and has become practically forgotten , but it is nonetheless one of spielberg 's best films -- a great movie that i highly recommend .		10		1
michael mann 's feature film adaption of his seminal 80s tv series comes across as a complex , exciting and thoughtful drama and is totally removed from both the tv series and a stereotypical view of what this film audiences might have expected . nevertheless it is accessible and hugely entertaining . in fact , just behind heat and the insider this is michael mann 's third best film as a director . the action sequences are like heat , only as a result of the development of the story . they are grounded , realistic and very exciting . the story , while paying homage to the original tv is complex , involving , thoughtful and engrossing , and michael mann 's use of digital cameras really works for this film in helping tell this story . the film drops you straight into a `` day on the job '' and intelligence that is received by crockett and tubbs , both very well played by colin firth and jamie foxx , while on this job leads them into a new deep undercover role . gong li is also very impressive in the role as part of a drug dealing cartel . in fact , all performers are first rate and their low key and introspective performances are the major successes of the film . the characters are played as being on the job for a long time , and it looks like that all the key characters have become so immersed in the job that is all they live for . the development of firth and gong 's character is interesting within the context of the story as we see the flickering 's of a life beyond their day to day existence , just as an event in the film leads to the subtle humanising of foxx 's character , but as to whether these character changes are permanent , the viewer will need to judge for themselves . action scenes are exceptional in their gritty execution . dion beebe 's camera-work is first rate , and the use of characters presented in silhouettes works very well in terms of the subliminal message of the work they are doing being in shadow . there are some interesting effects of the digital filming , with some action scenes having an almost video like look . the mix of songs and jon murphy 's score works well and really creates a mood for the story to play out in . director michael mann again orchestrates the film with skill and style . as shown on films such as the insider , he brings superb visual storytelling to dialogue and character focused scenes and yet handles action scenes in an involving and exciting way . in summary a superb thriller that is up there with heat and insider as an outstanding film from michael mann , and it is a shame that it was not successful enough to warrant a sequel .		10		1
it was very hard to choose my top miyazaki film , but i choose nausicaä of the valley of the winds . at first , i had never seen the film , until i had bought the disney 2-disc dvd of the film ; i thought the was excellent , with alison lohman as nausicaa ; shia labeouf as asbel ; patrick stewart as lord yupa , and uma thurman as kushana . the film is based on a manga made by miyazaki himself . set in the year , a thousand years in the future , when global war had incinerate the earth . the earth has become an unrecognizable place . large parts of the world have been swallowed up by forests of poisonous fungi . the remaining humans live near the fungus and it 's monstrous insectoid inhabitants , trying to prevent it 's spread . one of the human kingdoms , the peaceful valley of wind , loves its gentle princess nausicaä and her father the king , but their peace is about to be broken , as they are swallowed up in the machinations of their larger , warmongering neighbours . however , nausicaä has hidden potential , and may yet change the fate of the world . it 's truly miyazaki 's epic masterpiece , and also a good film to show us the seriousness of global war and our environment .		10		1
a enforcer for a gangster in the liquor business finds the tables turned on him and goes on the run with his son in `` road to perdition , '' a 2002 film directed by sam mendes . tom hanks plays michael sullivan , a quiet , remote father of two who works for a crooked liquor dealer , john rooney -lrb- paul newman -rrb- who took him in and treats him as his son . his two boys are n't clear about what he does , and one night , when he goes out on a job , his older son , michael jr. -lrb- tyler hoechlin -rrb- hides in the car and follows his dad and connor rooney -lrb- daniel craig -rrb- as they go to `` talk '' to someone . as the young boy watches , connor loses his temper and starts shooting up the place , and michael joins in . connor sees michael jr. when he exits . michael sr. of course promises that his boy wo n't say anything . on his next job , connor gives him a note for the man michael is to see , who is in heavy debt to john rooney . michael is forced to kill the man when he sees that the man is about to kill him . on looking at the note connor asked him to deliver , it says , `` kill sullivan and all debts are paid . '' several hours later , michael 's life is devastated , and he and his older son are on the run , michael determined to destroy connor . i saw this film without being aware of anyone liking or disliking it or of it being overlooked by the oscars - i only had heard of it and actually rented it because i am a huge fan of paul newman 's . let me say that i was astounded by the brilliance of this film in every aspect . it possibly captured the time period of the early '30s better than any film i 've ever seen , right down to the tissues i used to see piled up in my grandparents ' basement . the cinematography is staggering . the gangster story in `` road to perdition '' actually wraps around a more important one , that of the bonding of father and son , which is beautifully told . hanks is magnificent as a closed off man who gets to know his boy during their life on the run , and vice versa . `` he dotes on you , '' a woman on a farm tells michael . the two michaels are alike , but senior never wants junior to follow in his footsteps . paul newman is , as usual , terrific as john rooney , a tough gangster who goes to communion but knows `` none of us will ever see heaven . '' he was around 77 at the time of the filming and as handsome and dynamic as ever . daniel craig does a phenomenal job as the vicious connor . amid so many brilliant performances , jude law plays one of the most disturbing , frightening characters in film history , harlen maguire , a hit man who makes money not only by killing , but by photographing the dead victims and selling the photos , which adorn his wall . he 's absolutely nauseating , and law does n't miss a beat . the always wonderful stanley tucci is frank nitti , and jennifer jason leigh has a small role as michael 's wife . as michael jr. , tyler hoechlin perfectly embodies all the emotions necessary for the role : the fear , anger , love , and loyalty . he and hanks have the film 's biggest roles , and they carry it , making it look easy . this is a suspenseful , poignant , sad and violent masterpiece . one of the comments warns against comparing it to the godfather - i hope nobody did this . it stands on its own , and one has nothing to do with the other . a great artistic achievement by sam mendes who worked with a beautifully realized script and top cast . now that i 've seen it , i ca n't believe it was so overlooked at the oscars , but when i think of all the oscars newman has been cheated out of , i guess i 'm not only surprised , but i 've about had it with the oscars . i almost gave `` road to perdition '' a 9 instead of a 10 only because i 'm not big on lots of blood . if you are , too , i suggest you watch it anyway . you wo n't be sorry . a powerful experience .		10		1
the last detail -lrb- 1973 -rrb- **** jack nicholson , randy quaid , otis young , carol kane , michael moriarty , clifton james , nancy allen , gilda radner . nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in hal ashby 's film about two career navy officers assigned to escort prisoner quaid to the brig on bogus charges , with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation . raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema . ** trivia note : quaid beat out a young john travolta for his role . best scene : jack trying to get quaid served in a podunk pub . best line : `` heineken ? why it 's the finest beer in the world ! president kennedy used to drink it ! '' electrifying nicholson !		10		1
when i first read `` the hobbit '' and `` the lord of the rings '' trilogy back in the early 1970 's , i recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie . `` star wars '' still had n't come out yet , and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by j.r.r. tolkien , it was simply best left to the imagination . well , imagination has found life in `` the fellowship of the ring '' , a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy , just as the books did for the written word . upon first seeing it during it 's initial release , i could n't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure . everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind ; it was as if peter jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on . i feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of middle earth , as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation . for example , when the black riders appear for the first time , it 's difficult to grasp what they 're all about , other than the fact that they 're after the ring . strider 's explanation of the nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men , neither alive nor dead , who always feel the power of the ring . coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place . the real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other . though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear , can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves , dwarfs , hobbits and wizards actually exist . even orcs and evil uruk hai have a place in this world , for without the danger they pose there is no triumph . if the movie captures your imagination and you have n't read the trilogy or it 's prequel `` the hobbit '' , you 'll be doing yourself a favor to do so . there in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of middle earth . it 's a world easy to get lost in , and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land , people , and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone .		10		1
when `` pay it forward '' first came out , people were suspecting oscar buzz . well , after it was released , its performance at the box office was n't too good , the reviews were mixed and everyone i know was telling me that this movie was bad . luckily , i still felt the urge to strut on down to the video store and check it out . this is a truly magnificent film ! not only is it emotionally powerful , but it 's inspiring and has one of the most terrific messages ever delivered in motion pictures . the idea of `` pay it forward '' is a quite noble , original and useful concept . it can actually be applied to the real world . instead of paying back the person who has helped you through a sticky situation -- though it would be nice to do so -- just pass the torch to three others who are also in need of help . that way it keeps things moving , like a chain letter and this world can gradually become a better place . it 's a hell of a lot better than sitting back , bitching and moaning about the world 's problems when you 're not doing a damn thing to help . i 'm sure a lot of the film 's themes will hit home . helen hunt was excellent in a role much different from her usual typecasting . she plays an alcoholic waitress , with a sort of trailer-trash attitude . but deep down inside she wants to better herself . i 'm sure lots of audiences watching this film will be able to relate to her character -- those who 've grown up with either parent as an alcoholic . and the whole theme of her husband coming back to see her son , and ending up making things worse , i 'm sure will also hit close to home . aside from helen hunt , the other actors were magnificent as well . kevin spacey delivers yet another magnificent , powerful performance as a burn victim who teaches the 7th grade . i like how the film never romanticizes his handicap , and at times you forget the burn marks on his face . spacey deserved another nomination , and definitely deserved to win over russell crowe in `` gladiator '' ! jim caviezel delivers a very touching performance as a homeless substance abuser . almost every time he appeared on screen , i burst out crying . haley joel osment delivers a performance even more impressive than his breakout debut in `` the sixth sense . '' i just felt this role required more subtlety , and would 've been an impressive performance even if he were thirty years older . this role really proves his knack for acting , and i 'm sure he will grow up to win many oscars . let 's just hope he does n't become another macaulay culkin ... lol . if the musical score sounds familiar , it was composed by thomas newman who also composed the incredible score for `` american beauty . '' if you notice , the music in this film has a rhythm synonymous to the music in `` ab . '' and just like in kevin spacey 's previous powerhouse motion picture , it perfectly fits the tone and accentuates the mood of each scene . i ca n't say i was thrilled with mimi leder 's past work . she 's a fine director , but i think her previous efforts like `` deep impact '' and `` the peacemaker '' were just not written very well . and she did n't have a lot to work with . the screenplay , this time around , is excellent and she had a lot to work with . and this time i will congratulate her for bringing such a brilliant motion picture to life . `` pay it forward '' is real drama . there 's absolutely no melodrama , no cheap sentimentality . this is a great movie that makes you feel good at times , depressed at others -lrb- especially at the very end -rrb- , but always touches your heart . it tries to display a positive outlook on life , yet at the same time showing us that some things ca n't be changed and we will never live in a utopian society . if this movie does n't touch your heart ... i ask you to explore it more deeply . that 's my way of paying it forward to you . my score : 10 -lrb- out of 10 -rrb-		10		1
spielberg 's latest opus is a tremendously energetic science thriller set in the year that is extremely timely now given the current climate of fear and paranoia in our country . tom cruise is the head cop of a unique washington d.c. law enforcement agency known as pre-crime . the agency 's purpose is to stop crimes before they have a chance to be committed , and there are three pre-cogs -lrb- pre-cognitive beings -rrb- that can see these crimes of the future . max von sydow is the ceo of pre-crime who is anxious to take his creation to a national level , given that it has reduced the d.c. murder rate down to zero . but an ambitious assistant attorney general -lrb- colin farrell -rrb- has put a flaw into the system , and the pre-cogs envision a murder to be committed by cruise himself . soon , cruise is on the run , trying to prove his innocence but also needing to know how things are going to turn out . based on a 1956 short story by phillip k. dick , whose writings provided the basis for total recall and blade runner , minority report , even at 135 minutes , is energetic , fast-paced , and hugely suspenseful . under spielberg 's usual top-notch direction , cruise gives another fine performance as the hero of the piece ; and samantha morton is equally fine as the pre-cog named agatha , who assists him . the visual effects work of industrial light & magic is quite incredible , the look of the film is stunning , and john williams contributes another innovative score of the same stripe he gave to a.i. , spielberg 's previous and unjustly maligned movie . combining the obvious science fiction futurism with elements of the crime and psychological thriller genres , minority report is a film that must be seen more than once for the viewer to absorb every little nuance , because there are many such nuances throughout this film . the result is the finest film of the year 2002 .		10		1
this film is fantastic !! it 's tied with `` titanic '' for the most number of oscars won , so you know how good it must be . charlton heston , who is one of the greatest actors of the 20th century , is magnificent in this , his oscar-winning role of judah ben-hur . while everyone is familiar with the famous chariot race scene , my favorite scene is when judah ben-hur is offered some water by a mysterious man , who happens to be jesus . his kindness renews hope for ben-hur , who was totally despondent . i adore that part . i definitely recommend this movie . i think it 's one of the greatest movies ever made . everyone needs to see this fantastic cinematic wonder . i give it a 10 out of 10 .		10		1
they couldn ` t have made dick tracy any better ! with a all star cast , great acting , tons of action , great villains and characters and most of them are from the comics which they look great in this movie , and a great double score/soundtrack by danny elfman and madonna makes dick tracy a classic ! i saw this when it came out in the theatre and it was awesome ! i just love this movie and i hope there will be a sequel soon !		10		1
`` ted '' is a film that 's filled with ribaldry , and gloriously un-pc pop - culture references ... it 's also handy that the marketing never made it out to be anything other than ` dumb ' ... if you were a dissatisfied audience member who was expecting a movie starring a talking teddy bear to be deep , then i do n't know what to tell you . i do n't think it 's a big surprise that people who are huge fans of family guy are more likely to enjoy this than those who are n't . most of family guy 's jokes are lazy too ... but in general they 're funny anyway because they 're and delivered well . not all humour has to be clever in order to amuse . maybe there were a few ` epic movie ' type jokes where a random reference is thrown in for no bigger reason than a surprise laugh , but they were carried off with a lot more style and context than friedberg & seltzer manage . not every joke can be right on target , but i thought that there were more hits than misses , and you soon forget the bad ones if you 're laughing at the shots that struck home . a couple of the movie references did annoy me though , being almost shot for shot , and really unimaginative ... there was no need to spell out the second `` aliens '' joke , for example - it would have been far funnier for a savvy audience to need to work it out by themselves ... but i laughed long and loud at other parts of the movie , so i 'm prepared to forgive the odd moment that fell flat . they ca n't all be winners . overall it 's a fun time at the movies , provided you have an inkling that macfarlane 's style of humour is your cup of tea .		10		1
this wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won adrien brody his academy award and finally made him a star -lrb- along with his gracious yet heartfelt oscar speech and that kiss : -- rrb - -- rightly so , since title character wladyslaw szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways ! it 's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive , deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into nazi hands in war-torn poland , but brody pulls it off . it helps that brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes , plus his body language speaks volumes ; these fill in the emotional cracks , especially in scenes where szpilman , alone and in hiding , ca n't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away . -lrb- brody is the youngest actor to date to win the best actor oscar , btw , having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday . -rrb- while there 's no lack of haunting scenes , thanks to the deservedly oscar-winning work of director roman polanski and screenwriter ronald harwood , the one that always gets me is the one where szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest ` safe house ' has a piano . we see szpilman sit at the piano ; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot , shoulders moving ; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize , with both relief and a pang of regret , that the music is only in szpilman 's head . terrific as the other 2002 best actor nominees were , now that i 've seen the pianist -lrb- as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the dvd 's flip side , showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience brody 's job often was -rrb- , i 'd be really p *** ed off if anybody but adrien brody had won ! -lrb- besides , the rest of the 2002 best actor nominees already won oscars -- this time it was dark horse brody 's turn ! : - -rrb-		10		1
one of the most wonderful and beautiful entertaining family masterpieces is 1939 's all-time classic , `` the wizard of oz '' . directed by the same director of `` gone with the wind '' in the same year , victor fleming has helped to bring l. frank baum 's timeless children 's ' stories to life on the big screen . the story tells about dorothy gale and her dog toto , who get sent to the land of oz , after their house in kansas was sent in a tornado . along the way , they meet singing munchkins , a scarecrow in need of a brain , a tin man in need of a heart , a lion in need of courage , a beautiful kind witch , flying monkeys , a green nasty witch , and a wonderful wizard of a green city . `` the wizard of oz '' is one of my all-time favorite movies for many reasons . it 's a movie for all audiences to enjoy , and it 's perfect for the whole family . the performances by judy garland , frank morgan , ray bolger , bert lahr , jack haley , and margaret hamilton as these wonderful characters were quite memorable to watch on screen . the characters are memorable , the art direction and costumes are imaginative , the story is timeless , and the music is still wonderful , with all of those classic songs we used to sign to as children . the songs never leave your head , and you always want to hum to them . `` the wizard of oz '' is a beautiful memory of our childhood , and it brings some heartwarming moments of love , courage , and how home matters . i can watch this movie over and over again , because it 's the definition of an entertaining classic family film . `` the wizard of oz '' , in my review , `` a wonderful masterpiece of entertaining proportions '' .		10		1
i 've recently been re-viewing all of the bergman films . this has been the hardest to watch . first of all , there is the claustrophobic house with the dying sister . we eventually come to realize why the other sisters are so fearful because agnes exemplifies their futures . they are two really cold fish who have done nothing with their lives . they have married badly -lrb- the husbands are a whole other issue -rrb- , and they have no future . at least agnes has been released though her death scene is absolutely gut wrenching . we also have anna , the loyal servant . in period pieces do n't the servants always have the upper hand ? she understands much of what is going on . she ca n't understand why all this pain is allowed . while she ca n't express her disdain , she feels it . it is agnes whom she loves because in her death there is more life than in the other two . the camera is amazing in this film , the rooms , the close-ups , the color . one of the most impressive scenes is the mundane dinner scene where karin 's husband , the diplomat , eats fish for about five minutes , while she stares at his tiresome presence . she later cuts herself to avoid sex with him . maria is the profligate who wo n't even go for help when her husband , another idiot , stabs himself . he survives . she even flirts with agnes 's doctor after he pronounces agnes 's imminent death . this is quite a film .		10		1
the mist the mist : 2007 color 122 mins . horror-thriller thomas jane , jeanne tripplehorn , william sadler , laurie holden , alexa davalos , sam and nathan gamble star . written by stephen king directed by frank darabont rated r for strong language , violence and gore . what to say about the mist hmmmm ... well i hated 1408 the last king adaptation and i liked shawshank but did n't think much of the green mile both directed by darabont . i 'm definitely a thomas jane fan i had a huge crush on him in deep blue sea and laurie holden of silent hill and alexa davalos of chronicles of riddick kick major ass . but that first trailer was so lackluster it looked like a bad tv movie and than came the second one and it was more enticing . the fantastic reviews starting popping up calling it one of the best films of the year and such so i started to get a bit more excited . but had to remember that 1408 got good reviews as well and i hated that . so i went into the mist with decent expectations hoping it would n't be like the fog remake . it was n't . the mist is one of the most hardcore , intense horror films i 've ever seen it 's also the best film of the year and one of the best films i 've ever seen . the plot setup is simple and can be seen in the trailer . a storm comes and people race to the local to pick up supplies just in case there is another . they become surrounded in the mist and must fend off creatures that live within it . creatures that range from giant mosquitos to giant acid spewing spiders and leech like tentacles amongst others . this is a monster movie people . the most realistic monster movie ever made . and it will make you shake . it 's scary , disturbing , emotional and thought provoking . i 'm not sure what to make of the film 's finale . i have only to say that it affected me on a deeply profound level rising the film above sheer entertainment value and making it a piece of art . the acting is fantastic especially from thomas jane whom gives a surprisingly emotional performance , the minor characters are also quite involving and do more than hold there own . with special kudos given to tripplehorn as the person you will most hate in any movie ever . gamble as jane 's son and laurie holden who does an awesome job as a new addition to the town . the film is layered with twists and subtexts . the cinematography is richly direct , realistic and dreamlike at the same time and the direction is artistic and and the screenplay is powerful . only the spfx seems lightly flawed but are easily forgiven by the film 's incredible execution . the mist has many things to say and i could n't quite take all of them in but it 's the type of film that you have to keep seeing and discussing because it 's not one to be dismissed lightly surprising for a monster movie , huh . the best film of the year , the mist is brilliant . ***** / 5		10		1
people , regardless of positive or negative reviews , take this movie too seriously . they try to connect this film with society today , the greed for money and power . this movie was released in 1983 , just watch it for the great film that it is , a classic . sure this film focuses on issues at hand , but it 's not meant to . also , this film is enjoyable for what it is , and many other films have taken ideas from this film which might be why the ratings are low , but keep in mind this was released before those . tom cruise does great as he usually does , but he 's near his prime in this film . i enjoyed it , as well as the script and the dialogue . it was witty , unpredictable , and enjoyable . try not to associate american politics and economics with this film , otherwise you 'll be expecting a deeper plot and a more suitable ending .		10		1
i saw this in a shoddy cinema at a lesbian film festival without knowing even the movie 's title and without expecting anything , and it blew me away . superficially this movie may be classed as `` '' but that fact that i 'm neither -lrb- ok , alternative maybe , but even that 's debatable -rrb- proves that the movie reaches way beyond that on so many levels . it shows that there is nothing about being , say , a lesbian , that ca n't ultimately relate to . and it proves that can dig a gay movie , the same way some gays dig pretty woman . this is also one of the few movies that plausibly relates a turn-of-the-century setting . it 'll make you think twice about calling it the belle époque .		10		1
american beauty has just made my top ten list of all-time favorite movies . i have rarely seen a movie that has such masterful filmmaking and one that plays with all your emotions all so perfectly during the running time of two hours . this is a perfect satire on american life and on the life of an ordinary family . what i liked is none of these characters are the villains , but they all are shown to have flaws and yearn for better things in life . this movie has the perfect balance of humor and drama and i was surprised how funny some scenes were . this film happens to be the theatrical debut of sam mendes and he directed one dandy of a film . his film takes a look on the life of the burnham family . this film looks at the dwindling marriage of lester and carolyn burnham and the relationship of their daughter and the son of their new neighbor . there is also the relationship of that son and his father which is quite intense . in order for a film like this to work , there must be marvelous acting . kevin spacey is a very gifted actor and he is the perfect guy for lester . he truly gives a powerful performance from the moment his voice over starts at the beginning of the film . annette bening gives a great performance as carolyn . i also loved chris cooper as the military neighbor . his scenes were intense to say the very least . overall , this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . this is somewhat of a satire , but realism is integrated in the movie . i loved the camera work in the film especially when the red flower petals are floating during some scenes . this is a true 90 's masterpiece and i was hooked from the beginning to the end . these characters are n't bad people , but they were trying to have a better life and that i sympathize with them . i rate this film 10/10 .		10		1
hand-drawn animation may be faltering while computer animation flourishes , but the old 2d standby is still capable of producing true greatness . one example of this is `` the triplets of belleville . '' created by sylvain chomet of france , it takes us into a strange and wonderful world . the characters are amazing to behold , to the squat clubfooted mme. souza to the identical gangsters . the opening sequence is especially good , paying tribute to the animation style of the 1920 's . this feature is paired with the short `` destino , '' born of a collaboration between walt disney and salvador dali . the surreal beauty of the short is excellently matched with `` belleville . '' so , i 'd say that even though 3d animation is still a force to be reckoned with today , with gems like `` belleville , '' do n't count 2d animation out !		10		1
i do n't think we 've seen this ever since it , was on local tv movie , night time slot with all those commercial interruptions . at any rate , i could n't have been more than 19 years old at the time , and although thought i was real grown up and sophisticated , an awful lot of it surely went over my little old sophomoric head . this evening , november 5 , 2007 , it was on turner classic movies . we screened it here in our house . at now over 60 years of age and looking at film through more experienced eyes and heart , the whole story and its meaning on multi levels really had begun to make real sense . to begin with , we have a 1920 's -lrb- ? -rrb- setting . it appears to be set in the upper or mid south , like kentucky , tennessee or west virginia , even . it is definitely small town america with all the trappings of being `` bible belt '' . the story moves like lightening from the very first . our rookie director , mr. charles laughton has made this , his first and only directorial job , in contrast to his prolific and outstandingly accomplished run on stage and before the camera 's lense . it is truly a shame , charles ! judging by this solo production , it surely leaves the movie going public to wonder , what could have been ? the sudden appearance of an itinerant parson , harry powell -lrb- mitchum -rrb- comes into town , on a mission to look up the family of recently executed con ben harper -lrb- peter graves -rrb- . meeting up with the widow , willa harper -lrb- shelly winters -rrb- and the two harper children , pearl and john -lrb- sally jane bruce & billy chapin -rrb- . we quickly find out that the ` good parson ' is in actuality a deranged , psychotic killer . his pose as a preacher is not a shallow concoction , for in his warped , criminal mind , he believes that he really that he does talk directly to god , and receives instructions from the almighty about killing the `` painted and perfumed women of the world . he has his weapon of choice in a convenient little old push-button knife , which he carries in his coat pocket . in the course of the story , we find out that the ` parson ' is after the $ 10,000.00 proceeds of the armed robbery committed by the kids ' father , in which he shot 2 people dead . the charismatic , but sociopathic fake preacher manages to get a good standing in the community and marries the widow harper -lrb- miss winters -rrb- and soon after virtually mesmerizing her , rendering her a pitiful , guilt-ridden `` sinner '' , who he uses in his prayer meetings . he then kills her , telling the towns people that the mother had run off , and saying that she had abandoned them . the bulk of the plot concerns the plight of the kids in trying to make the adults of the town believe in the danger that surrounded the kids . then we follow the kids on their meandering odyssey down the river in the row boat , the ` parson ' still on their trail . eventually the kids meet up with the kindly and truly christian rachel cooper , who takes the ids in along with the other foundlings . eventually the law catches up with the killer parson who is tried and sent to death row , state prison . the end . when viewing this picture , the night of the hunter , we would do well to follow the story , carefully observe any potential symbolism , because damn , if it does n't seem to be there ! the film is usually classified as a murder mystery or something , but it 's not at all so easy to put this in any pigeon hole . from the earliest parts of the film , the images we get of mitchum 's ` parson ' character are the images of a monster . that is a monster in the classic horror movie tradition . and , he 's really not so unlike mr. boris karloff 's rendering of the frankenstein monster . observe his lumbering through the marshy river bank . look at his lunging forward and walking at about a 15 degree angle , just as karloff 's monster did in the earliest scenes after his creation . in other scenes , the ` parson ' more resembles the grim reaper , in still others , the headless horseman . when winged by from a less than accurate shot gun blast , he screams and hollers like a wounded animal . -lrb- the main difference is that no animal , other than some of our fellow homo sapiens sapiens , would commit such heinous acts . -rrb- and director charles laughton chooses to end the film much like he began it , with a sort of abstract scene of prayer featuring rachel cooper -lrb- miss lillian gish -rrb- with images of the children all about them . this last scene , coming at christmas time and praises the little children of the world and begs for better treatment of them all . all we can add is , amen , mr. charles laughton , amen ! update : -lrb- dateline , chicago , illinois , december 22 , 2007 -rrb- we just finished watching night of the hunter again today on turner classic movies . it seems that we forgot to mention the fine original score done by walter schumann . he is probably best known for another of his compositions ; that being the theme and music for dragnet on radio -lrb- -rrb- , television -lrb- 1951 - ' 59 , ' 67 - ' 70 -rrb- and the feature film -lrb- mark 7 ltd. / warner brothers , 1954 -rrb- .		10		1
with topical movies , timing can be everything . with `` to be or not to be , '' there was good news and bad news . the good news was that it was written and produced in 1941 , before america entered the war following the japanese sneak attack on pearl harbor on december 7 -lrb- but after the sept. 1 , 1939 invasion of poland -- which , unlike some european countries , put up a brave fight -rrb- . the bad news was it was released shortly after , in early 1942 , when americans , now facing the barrel of german weapons , did not find the nazi menace so amusing . the new york times movie review by bosley crowther -lrb- who usually was on the mark -rrb- found the humor of questionable taste , saying there was too much jack benny in the role : `` but it is hard to imagine how any one can take , without batting an eye , a shattering air raid upon warsaw right after a sequence of farce or the spectacle of mr. benny playing a comedy scene with a gestapo corpse . mr. lubitsch had an odd sense of humor -- and a tangled script -- when he made this film . '' but without benny it would have been a different movie , and , frankly , too somber and sad to be bearable , at least today . if it had been released before pearl harbor , the reviewer might have found benny perfect for the role . and if the movie had been released in 1943 or 44 , it might have been viewed as a brave defiance of nazi might , and just the thing to lift spirits and boost morale . to watch old movies is to be faced by a quandary . back before television resale rights or dvd revenue , it was make or break based on ticket sales , so an average director 's first priority was to contemporary audiences . to appreciate an old film , it helps to understand the times of the contemporary audience , in this case , the outbreak of wwii . but a great director like ernst lubitsch probably was not just thinking about `` today '' when he made the film ; presumably , he was thinking about the audiences of tomorrow , when the war was long over , won or lost . `` to be '' is also a message in a bottle to the future . here is what director peter bogdanovich had to say : `` for lubitsch , the nazis ' most damning sin was their bad manners , and to be or not to be survives not only as satire but as a glorification of man 's indomitable good spirits in the face of disaster -- survives in a way that many more serious and works about the war do not . '' -lrb- lubitsch 's influence extends far beyond mel brooks , according to bogdanovich 's essay , to hitchcock , billy wilder , and essentially all of modern hollywood . to understand this film is to see why . -rrb- today , the movie seems to have the right balance of humor and pathos , and to work on many different levels . today , we can laugh at `` mr. benny playing a comedy scene with a gestapo corpse . '' but it works best if you understand the times , the war . what most people today know about world war ii they learned from watching movies . and so they see `` to be '' within the memory matrix of other movies . what you need to do is study the history of world war ii , watch some of the fine documentaries , read about it , in books or online . we have all heard about `` concentration camps . '' in 1941 concentration camps like auschwitz were not yet used to implement the holocaust , but to punish german political prisoners and for victims of countries invaded by germany , like poland . my grandparents were not picked up by french authorities and sent to auschwitz until 1943 . it is sad that some people in europe are so ignorant of their own history . ** from the wikipedia article on auschwitz : `` the inmate population grew quickly , as the camp absorbed poland 's intelligentsia and dissidents , including the polish underground resistance . by march 1941 , were imprisoned there , most of them poles . '' if you understand history you will understand the deep sadness hidden by a smile in `` to be . '' footnote : about 25 minutes before the end , the camera shows a list from the appointment book of col. ehrhardt . 10:30 reads : maria tura . reads : schindler . - - - ** i wish to extend my sympathy to any student foolish enough to take dr. jacques coulardeau 's classes -lrb- which i certainly hope are not in history or geography or film -rrb- at the sorbonne , or wherever he actually teaches . dr. coulardeau , in his review , asks a truly bizarre question : why , if the allies knew about the concentration camps , did n't they stop the `` massacre '' ? dr. c. : maybe it had something to do with the concentration camps being inside germany and occupied poland , and germany was n't issuing tourist visas to american soldiers . i would like dr. coulardeau to explain why french officials collaborated with the nazis in sending french citizens , including my family , to their deaths in concentration camps ? america did n't start wwii , but it was american troops , not french , that ended the holocaust .		10		1
it 's not hard to see why alfred hitchcock 's ` vertigo ' is considered one of the greatest films ever made . it is a beautifully textured and layered movie , mysterious and confusing , but in a good sense . it 's a pity really that it has to come to an end and have it 's many components ` explained ; ' the enjoyment one gets is from imagining all the possibilities conjured up in one 's head while watching it . ` vertigo ' might be called an art film masquerading as mainstream entertainment , an apt if ironic description given its subject matter . the plot , to put it as simply as possible - a detective falls in love with a woman twice , the second time not realizing it is the same woman . she deceives him into thinking she is someone else , both times . a two-page synopsis of the various ins and outs of the story would do it no more justice . james stewart plays the detective , scottie ferguson . i 've always wondered why hitchcock chose stewart to play this role . being the great actor he was , he does a fine job and is very convincing , but if i were to have read this script at the time and been asked to think of , say , fifty working actors to consider for the part , james stewart would have come in . there just is nothing in the actor 's previous body of work to suggest he is right for the character in any way . the gangly , drawling , slow-talking , clearheaded , everyman made perfect sense for a movie like ` it 's a wonderful life . ' but to play an obsessed , neurotic , acrophobic , compulsive control freak who practically forces himself on a woman and insists she dress up like the , former object of his affections ... jimmy stewart ? you 've got to be joking . and yet somehow it works . kim novak as the woman is easier to figure out . she was the latest in a series of icy blondes just waiting to be unfrozen in hitchcock films ; this was a continuing theme in his movies that would continue long past ` vertigo . ' novak captures the strange madeleine and more common judy very well ; it is quite believable that the second character is , at first , intended to be a completely different woman . much of the magic of ` vertigo ' comes from not only wondering what will happen next , but pondering what has just happened , and what it means . rational explanations become less and less interesting . this is what i meant about the ending - outside of a supernatural one , there 's almost no way a movie like ` vertigo ' can have a completely satisfactory outcome . one certainly has to give hitchcock credit for coming as close as possible . he was not one for the paranormal anyway -lrb- i suppose ` the birds ' comes closest -rrb- ; his flights of fantasy have more to do with human motivations and the bizarre , sometimes insane workings of the mind . ` vertigo ' takes this approach , and in the characters of scottie and madeleine/judy , shows the most extreme manifestations of desire , submission , and delusion .		10		1
if you are a lover of suspenseful films then i highly recommend this one . this is among the better films of 2013 and i would not hesitate in voting for this one as the best film of that year . the plot of the film is about the mysterious disappearance of two little girls while they are playing outside their parent 's house . hugh jackman plays keller dover a construction worker who is facing financial problems and barely making ends meet for his family . when his daughter is mysteriously kidnapped , he takes matter into his own hands by kidnapping a suspect whom the police release because of lack of evidence . seasoned actor jake gyllenhaal plays detective david loki who is assigned this case . loki has a reputation for solving difficult cases and he takes this one as a particular challenge . both actors give a thoroughly professional performance . the direction , script , background sound effects and bleak atmosphere enhance this film . this is a film you 'll be left guessing till the end and even a veteran film buff like myself could n't figure out the person who was behind the kidnapping . similar films : the hand that rocks the cradle -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , when the bough breaks -lrb- 1986 -rrb- , the silence of the lambs -lrb- 1991 -rrb- , copycat -lrb- 1995 -rrb- , bone daddy -lrb- 1988 -rrb- , resurrection -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , the deliberate stranger -lrb- 1986 -rrb- , the gray man -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , dahmer -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , to catch a killer -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , seven -lrb- 1995 -rrb- . many more recommendations but i do n't have time to write them all down . message me if you 're a film buff or critic .		10		1
the cold war may have ended years ago now but this film seems both as funny and as dark as ever , with a great cast that includes peter sellers playing three different characters ; raf group captain mandrake who is on attachment to the us air force , president merkin muffley and the eponymous dr strangelove , a former nazi scientist now working for the us government . the action starts when general jack d. ripper orders the b-52s under his command to attack the soviet union , he does this because he believes that `` the evil commie plot of water fluoridation '' caused his impotence . once the authorities learn what he has done they assemble in the war room to discuss how to prevent the planes dropping their nuclear payload on russia . this includes both attacking gen ripper 's airbase in an attempt to force him to give the recall codes and inviting the soviet ambassador to the war room to warn the soviets and assist them in shooting down the planes . when the russians are called we learn that they have just built the ultimate deterrent ; a doomsday machine that will automatically detonate if russia is attacked , unfortunately they have neglected to tell the world as they wanted to make a surprise announcement at a party conference in a few days . the other location in the film is one of the b-52s flying into russia , it is captained by major t.j. `` king '' kong , played by slim pickens in wonderfully over the top form . the plot does n't sound likely material for comedy but it works wonderfully as almost all the characters appear to be slightly insane yet somehow it is possible to imagine that people like that could rise to positions of power as their insanity only shows after the attack has been launched . this is particularly true of general `` buck '' turgidson played by george c. scott who is more worried about the `` commies '' seeing the war room than at the prospect of global armageddon . while the film is almost constantly amusing the ending will send a chill down the spine of most people as we see the nuclear detonations while vera lynn sings `` we 'll meet again '' . these detonations are n't special effects but real footage of explosions which as the film is in black and white look almost as if they were done for the film .		10		1
the sad fact of the matter is that there are precious few flawless movies produced in this country ; most are bloated , dreck . precious , to the contrary , is the kind of movie that gives one hope for the future of film-making in this country : it 's an unflinching look at life in these here united states , and its frankness , if nothing else , merits mention . -lrb- and this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg . want to know what it 's like growing up poor in `` the richest country in the world ? '' read my semi-autobiographical novella pulp , in the collection the by manuel kelley ; it 's an book , but i urge you not to discount it . available , by the way , through loan . -rrb- precious is outstanding , with one of the truly great breakout performances .		10		1
pulp fiction is tarantino ` s second movie , and it is even better than reservoir dogs . pulp fiction has stars like john travolta , bruce willis , harvey keitel and samuel l. jackson , all those actors in a low-budget gangster movie . tarantino ` s script is fantastic , with lots of great characters , weird situations , great dialogue and violence . pulp fiction brought travolta ` s carreer back on track , and its easy to see why . travolta does a marvellous job as the gangster vincent vega . all -lrb- most of -rrb- the actors are great in this movie . 10/10		10		1
when i viewed persona recently , i did n't know what exactly to make of it : what was it telling me , what was its intentions , its ultimate meaning . not being a conventional director by far , i felt that bergman had deliberately left all this 81 minute of storytelling to me to figure out ... and i may have been right , but i either was n't getting it or this was too much of an abstract film to merit any analysis , so my review was at face value and even ended with the sentence `` this is exactly how bergman wants it . '' seeing it later more emerges , and the deeper story takes place even if it still seems linear : elisabeth vogler -lrb- liv ullmann -rrb- loses her speech midway through electra and will not speak again -lrb- except once throughout the entire film , and in an imagined sequence -rrb- . there is no apparent reason as to why she has lost her speech , and the only hint is the horror she witnesses on the television as war , genocide , and destruction rage on . other than that it is never alluded to , her muteness . into the picture comes alma -lrb- bibi andersson -rrb- , the nurse who is put to her care by the suggestion of a psychiatrist . both retreat to an isolated home . seeing that elisabeth will not talk , alma fills space and time with her own erratic ramblings that take shape and form , a need to fill a void , and that void is of course , elisabeth , who listens and listens and listens impassively yet with interest . alma 's stories are a form of confession : if elisabeth is the mute who bears the scars of the world , alma is the conveyor who purges inner traumas and erotic experiences , hurtful on a lesser scale . the fact she has been laid so naked to the woman she is trying to rehabilitate and the fact she learns this very woman considers her an interesting subject suddenly shocks her : from being caring , she turns vindictive . a shard of glass left deliberately to have elisabeth step over is the catalyst : the images break , abstract images take place again , and the story . but one wonders , what if elisabeth stepped over the glass with equal deliberateness ? after all , she does need alma . and she is an actress foremost . this moment is the one that amps up the tension between the women and even then they become closer , so close elisabeth 's husband thinks alma is her as elisabeth quietly allows this to happen . is elisabeth re-living some form of event through alma ? is alma the only way another secret involving elisabeth 's child can come through ? whatever the reason , alma is clearly a conduit for elisabeth to come forth and the merging of their similar faces is the culmination of this haunting psycho-drama that goes beyond its cinematic boundaries . no clear resolutions except the almost casual references that explain both women 's return to their own sense of normalcy , but this somehow inconclusive ending is what gives it the weight of a great story and excellent bergman . reality here is what is so common to us : who we see ourselves as , how others see us , how becomes self-preservation through the experiences of others , good or bad or a combination of both . pain and ecstasy are a part of our make-up , and persona is the best example of the merging of the two .		10		1
wimbledon , for all its focus on one of the world 's most storied competitions , is more of a coming-of-age tale than a pure sports movie . male protagonist peter colt -lrb- paul bettany , in the performance of his career -rrb- feels like something is missing from his life , but he 's not sure what it is . as he would say `` no , correct that , i know exactly what 's missing . '' he 's 31 years old , now ranked # 119 in the world , and while many remember his name from the tennis circuit , no one seems to remember that just a few short years ago he was # 11 -lrb- their guesses were a few spots shy of his true peak -rrb- . colt , from a well-off family , has just accepted a job as a tennis director at a country club , a nice retirement from the sport which will begin after his completes wimbledon , his final tournament . adding to peter 's problems are his parents , who have grown estranged to the point where dad sets up shop in a treehouse , and his brother , who cheerfully wagers against him in the first round as if he were counting on the outcome to pay his mortgage . no one is directly evil to peter , but the evil is that no one dislikes him because he is about as nonthreatening a presence on and off the court as a man can be . he is more pitied than respected , at least by the seeded players who view him as filler , good practice for the final rounds , but merely a local `` wildcard '' entrant who will make a graceful exit into retirement early on . he does manage to pick up a groupie in lizzie bradbury -lrb- kirsten dunst -rrb- , the brash , childish american star player who is expected to make wimbledon her first grand slam . lizzie 's dad -lrb- sam neill -rrb- is not thrilled with the distraction , so even having fun becomes as much a chore for peter as winning the match . it is not that he does not belong at wimbledon , but where he is thought to belong , that is the cruelty here . though more accomplished than almost everyone who will ever play the game , peter colt is barely known to the tennis world , and invisible to the rest of the world . colt approaches his first two matches at wimbledon as if they were executioner 's marches . his first match is against a prodigy who is expected to go far in his first grand slam , but as often happens , the journeyman takes him to school with solid play . the new job will now have to wait , as the french open winner awaits in the second round , along with the obligatory from his brother and disbelief from the media and commentators -lrb- john mcenroe in a lively and very technically accurate performance , with chris evert as his sidekick -rrb- . as was made obvious early in the film , it begins to become obvious to colt that the greatness his mother told him that he had was for real , but also that he had never wanted to reach down deep enough to bring it out . finally living in the present , colt leaves nothing on the table and disposes of this challenge as well , leaving him to play his practice partner in the third round . the `` old '' peter colt would have had a nice match against his equally nice training partner , but his desire to win -lrb- egged on by bradbury -rrb- has gathered too much steam , and the partner is left sliced and diced , remarking after the match that colt has a killer instinct never before seen . meanwhile , bradbury is winning her matches , but becoming increasingly distracted by what was supposed to be a boytoy becoming an important man in her life , and overshadowing her to the public , causing her father to go ballistic at the sight of him . he was right , of course , but sometimes other things in life are more important than tennis -lrb- for bradbury -rrb- , but sometimes , as for colt , tennis has to take priority . bradbury 's day will come ; it 's now or never for peter . we all could look back on our lives and know we could have accomplished more than we did , but we can also look back and be happy with what we 've done . professional tennis would not exist without the peter colts of the world , and this movie is a glaring tribute to the journeyman players who slave in profitable anonymity and who rule most corners of the tennis world beyond the tour . in peter colt 's case , he gets one last chance to separate himself from the masses and leave a mark on history , and while he had no delusions about climbing back to the top , anything can happen in one match , especially when the match is on your home court , a short drive from your house , against a player who may be great , but who could n't possibly have the life-and-death intensity that colt brought to the finals , with a little plot-driven background thrown in . as the final chapter unfolds , the movie takes a few swipes at sports-movie `` miracles '' and other cheesy plot devices , keeping the action as true-to-life as possible . cinderella may win , or she may be valiant in defeat , but in this movie , the result is a logical one , and not the product of dumb luck or superhuman strength -lrb- an incident where a is struck flips the bird at that idea -rrb- . all in all , a truly great film and an excellent example of what can be achieved in a true drama that does n't rely on gratuitous sexuality or special effects to pacify a dumbed-down audience , but which rather treats the viewer as intelligent and able to appreciate a good story , without making it so complex that only a tennis pro could follow it .		10		1
dumbo is a classic disney film that was made to help make up for losses that fantasia suffered prior . it is one of the shorter disney films at just about an hour long , but it is definitely one of the best disney movies ever . dumbo is an elephant who has exceptionally large ears . he is separated from his mother when she defends him from people who were making fun of him at the circus . the other elephants cast him out and do n't regard him as an elephant and he is made a clown . however a mouse befriends him and helps him to start to make his life better . dumbo is a great protagonist for the film . he is a character that you can root for due to him being a little different just because his ears are a little big . also he is definitely the cutest disney animal character out there so you want to see him succeed . also the supporting character timothy mouse is great . he is instantly likable when he befriends dumbo and wants to help him . great character . this is one of the shortest disney films . but i think that it is paced well and it is a good easy watch . its short , but it hits on all the important levels , with the exception being possibly a rushed ending . this film is quite touching . as far as disney movies go i would say that this one is one that could be a tear jerker . so it hits on the emotional side , especially the scene where dumbo goes to visit his mother . also the music is quite good with some songs that stand out in the disney universe of songs . when i see an elephant fly is a great fun song , baby mine is a sad touching song , and pink elephants on parade is a crazy song that you cant help but remember . so i would definitely rank this as one of the best disney movies ever . it has a great main character , a fast paced story , and some pretty good music . highly recommended .		10		1
`` atonement '' turns out to be a much better movie than it is a book . but before i explain what i mean by that , a little background on the story may be in order . ian mcewan 's novel - which spans eight decades , from the 1930 's to the present day - centers around briony tallis , a precocious 13-year-old who lives with her family on a country estate in england . briony is an imaginative child who revels in a world of fantasy and make-believe , a writer of stories and plays who is actually less equipped to interpret the realities of the adult world than she gives herself credit for . one unusually hot summer day in 1935 , briony witnesses a series of events involving her older sister , cecilia , and the caretaker 's son , robbie , that her child 's mind misinterprets in a way that leads to tragic consequences for all involved . her choosing to act on what she believes to be true winds up echoing down the corridors of time , through world war ii and beyond . as time passes and briony grows to adulthood , she comes to see the error of her ways and spends the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for what she has done . the coup de grace is that , due to circumstances beyond her control , briony is forced to achieve her redemption in the only way she knows how - as a writer . at the risk of offending devotees of the novel , i must confess to being somewhat less than enamored with a book that many seem to rank among their all-time favorites . for despite its sometimes impressive dreamlike quality , the novel is too contrived and self-conscious to make the reader anything more than a mere dispassionate observer of the events it is portraying . as a writer , mcewan has an undeniable flair for narrative voice and description , but it frequently comes at the expense of characterization and story . his plotting is often arbitrary and clumsy , and his dialogue , when indeed he deigns to use any , is almost always stilted and unconvincing -lrb- i have to admit to laughing and rolling my eyes when i was reading the crucial scene -rrb- . yet , something has gone terribly right with the material in its journey from the printed page to the silver screen -lrb- suffice it to say , i did n't roll my eyes this time around -rrb- . since film is a largely visual medium , screenwriter christopher hampton and director joe wright are able to convey through images what it takes mcewan endless reams of paper to get across . here , an idea can be suggested through a simple shrug of the shoulders , a meaningful turn of the head , a barely noticeable gesture or wave of the hand . and , indeed , the movie is rich in beautiful and unforgettable images that evoke a feeling , a time , a place , sometimes even an entire theme , all on their own . even though the screenplay remains faithful to the three-act structure of the piece , that structure comes across as less fragmented , less arbitrary and less self-conscious than it does in the novel . thanks to the seamless fluidity of seamus mcgarvey 's stunning cinematography and the unifying tones of dario marianelli 's brilliant musical score , everything in the film version of `` atonement '' feels perfectly integrated and all of a piece . of the performers , only keira knightley is in any way problematic . she looks positively gorgeous as the seductive cecilia , and there are moments when she achieves the proper mixture of tenderness and haughtiness essential to the character . but she has a tendency to spit out her lines in a much too rapid fashion and her tight-lipped -lrb- a problem , too , in `` pride and prejudice '' -rrb- eventually becomes annoying and distracting . as robbie , james mcavoy proves again why he is one of his generation 's most exciting screen talents , while young saoirse ronan is remarkably poignant and poised as the 13-year-old briony . ramola garai and veteran actress vanessa redgrave do nicely as briony in later stages of her life -lrb- although the ending , while moving , is a bit more reminiscent of `` titanic '' than it needs to be -rrb- . wright is often at his best when turning what could have been mere technical `` stunts '' into integral pieces of the drama : a beautifully realized , long tracking shot of the carnage at dunkirk , the effortless incorporation of a clicking typewriter into the musical score , a row of nurses marching in time to the rhythmic clacking . through sight and sound , wright creates a surrealistic , dreamlike tone , perfectly appropriate to the material at hand . what 's amazing is that , even with all these stylistic flourishes , wright never loses sight of the human drama at the story 's core . in his direction , he displays an astonishing economy of means , moving the story along at an almost breakneck speed yet never allowing the movie to feel telescoped or rushed . not only does his pacing not sacrifice the emotional resonance of the piece ; it greatly enhances it . `` atonement '' ends on a lyrical note of melancholic uplift that leaves audiences wrung out and emotionally exhausted , as briony engages in her final and greatest act of storytelling creativity . watching the movie `` atonement '' is nothing short of a rapturous experience .		10		1

in the days of revolutionized film-making its not that easy to be totally impressed by movies anymore . this movie however blew me away and i was surprised by its scale and storytelling . i of course already knew that d.w. griffith was a great storyteller , that with his storytelling techniques was decades ahead of its time but his storytelling for this movie was truly unique . it follows multiple plot lines , set in entirely different time periods . it in a way makes this movie 4 in 1 . the movie constantly switches back and forth between the different plot lines . it 's definitely true that the movie focuses more on the one plot line than the others . the judea and the paris story are for instance not featured as much in the movie as the babylon and the ` modern ' america story . it does n't make every element in the movie work out as powerful or even understandable . it 's of course to fully understand and follow the movie , since it features so many characters , plots and all of that without the use of sound . nevertheless , i really should n't be too harsh on the story since its simply brilliantly written and constructed into the movie . especially the spectacular and hectic last 40 minutes or so , in which every story reaches its conclusion and climax , work out fantastic . but it was not only the story and storytelling that surprised me but also most definitely the entire scale of the movie . this movie is epic ! it 's huge ! the sets are amazing -lrb- especially the babylon ones -rrb- and most of the movie is filmed without the use of miniatures or other filming techniques . this movie is pure and about 90 % of it is real . yeah sure , you can make a movie now days with armies of of cg soldiers battling each other but it just ca n't beat the real thing . especially the charge on babylon is huge and impressive and also surprisingly spectacular , even this present day , with the use of siege weapons and elephants . also the battle at the end of the movie is massive with literally hundreds of extra 's involved . really impressive looking stuff , like i said before , you just ca n't beat the real thing ! not only the sets look impressive but also the costumes and camera-work , with the use of some early close-ups . it 's interesting to see the parallels between the different stories . i think it was d.w. griffith 's intention to show how little has actually changed over the centuries and in that way provoke the viewer . key element in the movie is the struggle of love and the intolerance of some people , also of course mainly regarding love . the 4 stories are brilliantly tied together through those themes . there are a couple of interesting characters in the movie that are all put down well into the movie and its story . obviously most of the actors are overacting , like you could expect from a movie from the 1910 's . the movie features yet again a lot of d.w. griffith 's ` regulars ' , with of course mae marsh and lillian gish as the most notable ones , even though they do n't really play the biggest roles of the movie . an epic movie of grand proportions with some great storytelling . 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/		10		1
perhaps the best film noir movie of them all , `` out of the past '' has all the ingredients that make the genre so popular today . and jane greer is the definitive femme fatale . oh , how she supplements robert mitchum 's brilliant performance . that the two mesh as few other movie couples do is part of the fun of watching this once in a lifetime film . directed with élan by jacques tourneur , he made the wise decision to drop the title of the novel on which the picture is based , `` build my gallows high , '' for a much more alluring and apropos one , `` out of the past , '' which is a key to the story being told , even though the line `` build my gallows high '' is used toward the end of the show . the novel and the screenplay were written by the almost neglected daniel mainwaring , aka geoffrey holmes , partly responsible for such goodies as `` the big steal , '' `` the tall target , '' `` roadblock , '' `` the hitch-hiker , '' `` the phenix city story , '' and the original `` invasion of the body snatchers . '' he also did the rewrite of `` out of the past '' called `` against all odds , '' released posthumously . why he is not given more credit for his works is a mystery . if much of the narration sounds similar in style to walter neff 's in `` double indemnity , '' and frank chambers ' in `` the postman always rings twice , '' it 's because james m. cain had a hand in the screenplay . the story involves a one-time , jeff bailey -lrb- mitchum -rrb- , who botched a job for a big-time crime boss , whit sterling -lrb- kirk douglas in his second film role -rrb- , because he fell for the loving lies of his prey , kathie moffat -lrb- jane greer at her most cunning -rrb- . now jeff has a run-down gas station in small town america , dependable friends including a deaf mute , the kid -lrb- played by former child star dickie moore -rrb- , and meta carson -lrb- rhonda fleming -rrb- who loves him , and time to enjoy bucolic pleasures such as fishing . out of the past comes danger from whit sterling , seeking to rectify old affronts , and the return of siren kathie to haunt jeff 's heart once more . has jeff learned from the past ? he believes he has . so begins an elaborate cat and mouse game entangling jeff , kathie , whit , and whit 's henchmen in a struggle for survival in an amoral jungle , quite unlike the idyllic new life jeff had attempted to build for himself . the viewer will see some of the best acting ever put on the big screen . douglas is magnificent even when laid out on the floor . the cinematography by nicholas musuraca helps define noir . note the signs of threat and decadence lurking behind the rustic simplicity of the small town of bridgeport . all in all a film that deserves the praise it has received from critics and noir fans .		10		1
i saw this only once , and could n't finish it . the script was so bad , it would have been a laugh riot , if it were n't so disgustingly paranoid to the point of nausea . when america invaded iraq , american television stations owned by australian media king rupert murdoch , such as the fox network , began broadcasting this film and announcing it as a `` classic '' . apparently not only political history but film history are to be completely re-written by the far right - effectively adopting old soviet tactics that the right once vilified as the denial of freedom of thought . in fact , george w. bush himself would have made a wonderful stalinist if he had been born in soviet russia - but hey , why let ethnicity get in the way , he is a great stalinist , he just does n't speak russian -lrb- or very good american for that matter -rrb- . milius started out his film career rather well , doing pick-up work for the likes of sam peckinpah , before directing excellent historical action films , e.g. , `` dillinger '' and `` the wind and the lion '' . then he got hired for the weird -lrb- and undeniably racist -rrb- `` conan the barbarian '' , and everything about him just turned sick . drugs ? , money ? true colors showing forth ? only his psychiatrist knows for sure . i `` m going to include here a part of my review of a recent video game inspired by `` red dawn '' , `` freedom fighters '' , because it was playing this game that made me think of this movie : `` the soviets could never have invaded america , nor would they unless the us tried to invade them first . the soviets were too isolationist , and their leaders did n't trust each other enough to launch such an invasion , which would have strained their always unstable inner political structure -lrb- and their economy -rrb- . if they had invaded , american reaction would have been swift and devastatingly violent , whether the us were led by democrats - like jimmy carter , who , long before he entered politics , effectively designed the us nuclear submarine program , targeted specifically at the soviet union - or republicans like reagan . despite right-wing rhetoric , wars are not about flags -lrb- what the amish call `` painted rags '' -rrb- or -lrb- cities -rrb- . in 1812 , napoleon thought he had captured russia because he had captured moscow ; the russians let him know different . 42 years later , the confederate army fought union general sherman to preserve atlanta georgia , because they thought he wanted to use the railway network that joined at atlanta as a base ; so he had the whole city burned down just to prove he did n't care about their dam ' railroad . the kids who think stories -lrb- about a soviet invasion of america -rrb- make sense , have n't any notion what freedom really means , and so would never know how to fight for it . you do n't start by willing to kill - but by willing to die . to die , because `` freedom '' is only a for `` the next generation '' - that is , our children and our children 's children , and the kind of life we wish for them to enjoy . if this `` kind of life '' is all about money and consumer goods , then it amounts to nothing . it is the ability to think for one 's self and to define the self that thinks . it is the choice of morals , which admittedly deny us much of the grosser in life , not a choice of objects to enjoy . '' the most serious problem with the american right and its paranoid propaganda is that it does n't offer any of its followers anything worth dying for , any value worth preserving across have been tossing the word `` freedom '' about as though speaking the word were an inevitable result of breathing ; but they have yet to explain what freedoms they believe bush to be defending - since he repeatedly violates the bill of rights , the constitutional foundation of american freedom - and since bush has made it quite clear he never intended the iraqis to decide their own government for themselves . so - `` freedom '' ? - to do what ? to what end ? `` red dawn '' suffers the same miserable absence of values . since the film 's soviets do n't seem to be invading for any discernible political reason , the teenagers fighting them do n't seem to have any political reason for doing this either . but that is a fundamental intent of all right-wing propaganda : to scare people into killing others without giving them time to wonder why . and , unfortunately , there are plenty of people who prefer not to think for themselves . so if you want to `` get stupid '' for a couple hours , go ahead and watch this film . otherwise , read a good book - like `` red badge of courage '' or `` leaves of grass '' ; or just spend some time with the united states constitution , and consider the hope embedded within it - the hope that the likes of milius , bush , and murdoch repeatedly betray .		1		0
after ` the da vinci code ' was successful and obviously made plenty of money to hollywood producers , of course they decided to make a sequel very soon . ron howard was appointed again , tom hanks re-appears as lead character robert langdon , even more money is invested and everything is prepared for ` angels & demons ' ... oh wait , there is one problem , good script is n't on the menu ! i mean seriously how can it get this bad after an okay but still quite disappointing ` da vinci code ' . well let 's just put it this way , ` angels & demons ' makes ` da vinci code ' look like timeless masterpiece , yes , this movie is that bad . script is just terrible seriously , photography even worse , casting awful -lrb- except tom hanks -rrb- . for example , tom hanks and his female companion in this movie have no chemistry going on at all between them , it 's just plain bad choosing of actress , and i thought that french girl in ` da vinci code ' did n't fit good in a picture with tom hanks , if you compare them , the ` da vinci code ' girl fits great in her role . the worst , most boring and dreadful scenes of this movie are the ones with reporters and crowds in vatican , i mean it 's just so pointless and dumb . i thought the history talk in ` da vinci code ' was a bit boring and silly , well in this movie it just gets whole lotta worse . at some point , i do n't remember when , some 20 minutes at the start of the movie , i actually felt the suspense and i got kind of interested in the whole symbolic murders but it faded away really fast . and when you realize the conclusion to this whole plot you just feel disappointed with the whole thing about the events that happened throughout the film . the ending is again overcooked as in ` da vinci code ' or possibly even worse . whoever asks you to watch ` angels & demons ' , be it your mother , your father , your sister , your brother , your friends , your girlfriend/boyfriend or your neighbors that just borrowed the movie from video-store and have no one else to watch it with , take my advice and just say no !		1		0
what is this ? a really really boring flick that 's what . jet li has made some entertaining movies before . this is not one of them . the story , blah . the action , weak . the visuals , okay . this has the same lame `` action '' that crouching tiger , hidden dragon had , boring . seeing people float though the air is so freaking lame that it drives me crazy ! this movie drags on and on and is way , way to long . this movie made me sleepy , and that does not happen often -lrb- i even stood though battlefield earth without getting drowsy -rrb- . the last word : overrated . suffering from insomnia ? watch this and you will be out like a light . want a good jet li film ? try the enforcer instead .		1		0
okay , for a few minutes there , it was cool seeing james taylor and dennis wilson just hanging out ... then you realized ... wait ... this is a movie ? very quickly , these rock icons are revealed to be self-absorbed , self - conscious , conceited punks who think they can throw their jock onto the field and the game 's over ... i mean , these guys were stoned , the director was stoned , the film editor was stoned , everyone in the theater was stoned ... ... c'mon - there 's no other explanation . the film was devoid of plot , the girl was no prize - she brought new meaning to the word , `` plain '' ... the cars were no match for modern muscle cars ... the ending just characterized the cheapness and lack of effort in a film when a car crash is depicted by the film in the projector ... , . i kid you not . the absolute worst ... unbelievably , disgustingly complete bore fest .		1		0
there are two outstanding things in eric bana 's performance . his ears , which eric 's carefully neglected haircut only just disguises . all the in this film seem to find him irresistible , but hey girls , before you think about mixing genes with eric , check those out . eric does meet his match in drew barrymore , as she puts in a turn that makes madonna look like the new meryl streep . and then we 're supposed to care about assorted lowlife playing poker . what 's at stake ? as they say at scriptwriters ' school . well , $ 350 and eric 's mother 's ring which is worth ' a buck and a half ' . i kid you not . the scriptwriter -lrb- of ` the postman ' no less -rrb- wants us to sit through endless games of poker , the variation indicated by helpful signs at convenient intervals , on the strength of eric the wooden standing to lose $ . at least , that 's as far as i got before i turned it off . well , all right , it 's the wsop , but are n't all poker movies about that ? the rest of the film that is n't poker operates on the level of a beach party movie - complete with indoor volleyball . the supporting cast of assorted hollywood bad boys and lifelong achievers find keeping this particular beach ball in the air beyond their collective strength . not worth rating .		1		0
my wife and i did n't walk out on this movie only because we did n't have enough sense to lean over and say , `` you want to leave ? '' we were both sitting there , side by side , hating it . this is an utterly worthless film . not much happens , and at the end one can see no point whatever to it . what is this movie trying to tell us , what does it want us to feel , in what way are the events show really connected ? it is an utter , complete mess , and the fact that it 's gotten a fairly high vote on the imdb just confuses the hell out of me , because it 's really , really bad . the only thing i can think is that the book made sense and people who have read the book have a way of understanding what the point of it all is , but really , do n't go see this . just do n't .		1		0
now , usually , i have a tolerance for cinematic stinkers . i 've sat through `` cabin fever ; '' `` dude , where 's my car ; '' and `` what about bob , '' in their collective entirety . but , this one ? forget it !!! the premise was undeniably interesting . and , there were definitely some good laughs , early on . yet , as the movie continued , i began to laugh less and less . i mean , come on ! blabbing andy 's confession to the rest of the store 's personnel ? nowhere , in real-life , would dave , cal , and jay have had any right to do that ! and , if they were really his friends , they would n't have even thought of doing it , in the first place ! then , there 's the scene where dave -- still drunk after some kind of big matchmaking luncheon , where he ran into an ex-girlfriend -- starts videotaping his anatomy , front and back , from the waist down . right in the middle of the store , during business hours !!! and , all the female boss does is send him home for the rest of the day ? ! if i 'd been that boss , the real-life remedy would have had a lot more permanence . but , the last straw , for me , was that stupid soft-spoken argument between trish and the dorky fat kid over a pair of tin-foil disco boots with goldfish in the water-filled glass soles . something along the lines of , `` i know your stuff is just an exhibit for what you sell on ebay . but , since i 'm already here , anyway , why i ca n't just buy them , right now ? '' that did it ! i went to the men 's room , and flipped a coin . heads ; i would return to my seat , and literally suffer through the rest of it . or , tails ; i 'd go to the neighboring town of and see 's `` valiant . '' obviously , it came up tails . in short : if it 's a choice between remaining a virgin you 're whole life ; and finally getting some action , via the dubious help of alleged friends like dave , cal , and jay , then i say ... better never than late !		1		0
what misbegotten madman got the idea that this was funny ?! less of a movie than a newsreel on depressants , `` flirting with disaster '' could not have had a better title , as it wastes a perfectly good cast and a potentially hilarious plot on pure idiocy . the plot -lrb- if it was supposed to be a plot -rrb- has adopted child mel coplin -lrb- ben stiller -rrb- and his wife nancy -lrb- patricia arquette -rrb- searching for his biological parents . accompanying them is floozy psychiatrist tina -lrb- tea leoni -rrb- , who makes more than a few moves on mel . sound funny ? well guess what ? it never is . scenes that should have been uproarious end up making you feel like your face just melted , and you 're lucky -lrb- or is that unlucky ? -rrb- if you can stay awake until the end . like i said , this hunk o ' junk wastes not only the talents of the aforementioned stars , but also the talents of alan alda , lily tomlin , george segal and mary tyler moore ; the only excuse that anyone could have for starring in this would be a financial strain . all in all , not only was this a poor excuse for a movie , but 1996 was truly a low point for the usually dependable alan alda - he also starred in the dreadfully horrible `` everyone says i love you '' , woody allen 's worst movie ever . as just an extra note , i might add a little something . people did n't like `` the cable guy '' -lrb- directed by ben stiller -rrb- because they thought that jim carrey was wrong for the role ; i liked the movie 's impending sense of doom . `` flirting with disaster '' essentially takes a good idea and stretches it out until it turns into a bunch of random strands that lead nowhere . so that 's my assertion : ben stiller 's good movie disappeared , while his bad movie was exalted . shame on everyone .		1		0
it took me 3 evenings to see it through and even on the third evening i fast-forwarded the end . poetic ? - yes yes ... beautiful cinematography ? - sure sure ... how was the music score ? oh . . very nice ... how about the acting ? - i 'm sure it was fine ... story ? - well ... . the story seems to be the one thing of this movie which is terribly falling short . between all the artsy fartsy , the backs and the tries to shock , we 're left with a tale that could have been done in 15 minutes as well . most of all , there is simply no point . the film never really surpasses its own summery which adds only to it being a waste of of all the redeeming said qualities . to me it seemed that park needed to make a ` third and final ' and just took a number out of a hat . this becomes painfully obvious throughout the scene of actual revenge which seemed to just go on and on , exchanging the initial fresh absurdity for banality . on the whole . . very disappointing . 5/10		1		0
i like the actors in this movie so i thought i 'd give it a shot and i am glad i did , even if the movie is not as successful as one would have hoped . there are great scenes with brendan fraser with his parents , but i did n't think he had any chemistry with silverstone and their scenes lacked quite a lot . the movie is worth seeing , not worth taping or buying . i did like that brendan was well-mannered and polite to people .		1		0
cold mountain alternates between the stories of nicole kidman , waiting at home for her sweetheart to return from the civil war , and jude law , her sweetheart trying to find his way back to her . for conflict we have a rather nasty band of home guard who race around killing deserters ... but jude law is a deserter ... oh no ! run , jude , run ! another period tragedy masquerading as romance adapted from a famous novel by anthony minghella . this time its a sweethearts separated by the civil war `` tell me a tale '' story . the plot is mills and boone / midday melodrama , but so exquisitely filmed with such an exquisite soundtrack that we hardly notice . it maintains a sombre tone throughout , and goes for tears almost non-stop . i 've pinned down the fatal flaw with the film . i felt that kidman and law had zero chemistry : that the film worked , but when the two finally met up , it felt wrong , like they were two separate satellites , individually fine , but there was nothing between them . its built into the structure of the movie . the two hardly know each other before he goes off to war : they kiss , she gives him a photo and speaks in a poor southern accent , and that 's it . then they spend the entire movie not sharing the screen . they have their completely separate story-lines : him at war , and then journeying back to her ; her at home waiting for him . so by the time they finally meet , we have gotten to know them both as independent from each other - and somehow this fits . which is why it seems wrong once they 're together . and there 's the fact that kidman is an ice queen ! she 's becoming increasingly cold and distant - and looking more and more like vivien leigh . if she 's not careful , she may just end up like vivien . her career is in danger of disappearing if she does n't come back down to earth , experience the real world and real people again . for a female protagonist in this film we needed somebody who the audience could associate with , imprint themselves on - instead we have someone with only relevance to her insulated celluloid world than to us , the audience . she 's like a doll : elegant , but nothing to do with reality . zellweger is a definite scene-stealing highlight . a unique , vibrant character - almost a broad character , but not a 2d character . 7.5 / 10 . everything about its look is 10/10 stuff . superb cinematography , great performances from jude law , albeit iffy southern accents right the way through , and despite the fact that i did not like kidman at all in this , i was completely taken in by the movie . a superlative - but fatally flawed , to my mind , by the lack of a relation between the protagonists , and nicole kidman 's unwelcoming , mannered persona .		1		0
as much as i hate to go with popular consensus , i must admit that it is quite accurate in the case of this film ... it blows . it blows with the power of its title character 's . oh golly me , how it blows . nuclear man looks and sounds -lrb- apart from the fact that his lines being spoken in gene hackman 's voice , for no apparent reason -rrb- like something out of one of the conan movies . superman defies logic and science -lrb- yes , i know ... but he does it more in this one than in the two preceding it put together -rrb- , as does the film . and worst is the moralizing . the plot is quite poor . this is most definitely a sequel ... and one that shows signs of a series that should have had the plug pulled several films back -lrb- right after the first , some would say -rrb- . the writing displays a general lack of creativity . luthor is brought back ... slightly louder and less charismatic this time . we are introduced to lenny , portrayed by jon cryer . i , for one , did * not * need to see this man playing a teenager . he 's much funnier in hot shots and on two and a half men . and what was with the complete and utter waste of jim broadbent ? the man hardly utters a word in this film , and his screen-time is so small , he could have been an extra . i have n't seen much of him , but even from that -lrb- blackadder and moulin rouge -rrb- , i would gladly sign -lrb- or perhaps even start -rrb- a petition to legally change his name to funny man . the humor takes the leap out of the campiness of the previous effort , but the plunge in writing and directing keeps the audience consistently underwhelmed . the film is hardly dramatic ... the action sequences dire and unengaging . the writing scrapes bottom so hard that it goes right through , with no stop in sight . how many different beings is supes gon na fight before actually facing a villain we * know * -lrb- from the comics -rrb- , other than luthor ? i realize that lex is his arch-nemesis , but it 's as if these writers have gone to extreme measures just to avoid doing what is arguably easy -lrb- simply a villain already known -rrb- , but also what the real fans want . how many decades of history does this character have ? it should n't be difficult to find someone suitable . the writers of the old series of batman films managed ... four times , no less . granted , they also managed to screw up basically every film but the first , but they did have the assistance of joel schumacher , a director without any sense of making a comic book come to life as a film . back to this failure , sorry , film ... the effects are worse than ever before . the budget is quite clearly to blame . the attempts at drama or comedy are usually cringe-worthy ... as is the nature and heavy-handed delivery of the two messages . it just winds up sounding incredibly preachy . yes , we get it ... nuclear power is dangerous , newspapers should be about news , not making money . now stop trying to be morally superior ... that , incidentally , is * not * what movies are about . the acting is fine . all in all , this just really does n't have anything to offer . if you want food for thought on either message , read up on it or watch a documentary about it . if you want to see a good -lrb- or even passable -rrb- superhero film , look elsewhere . consult the fan-base for more info on which of the previous films in this series is better , or go with another hero -lrb- or check out singer 's vision , and hope that he gets to keep making them as long as he does as good as he has with the first -rrb- . i recommend this to fans of admittedly bad movies , as that is the only way this has any value at all , and as a lesson in what * not * to do when making a good film , for . 1/10		1		0
musicals fall into the same concept as comedy in that they are doomed genres . they are hollow inside , thus negating any real impact they might have . this struck me a lot as i watch chicago . first off , the songs stunk . i hope the writer got a nice big pink slip along with his paycheck after the oscars . ! more ignorance by the academy of fools ! i tried questioning myself as to why people pay money to see this , then it struck me ... the glamor . this movie symbolizes everything you could consider outrageous about the roaring twenties . by comparison , the untouchables is 2001 : a space odyssey . one film is focused on a story , the other is schmaltz . overall , even duller than moulin rouge . 1 out of 5 stars .		1		0
this movie gets it all wrong . after seeing too many switcheroo movies , author anthony shaffer has come to believe that if one reversal is good than a new reversal every ten minutes for over two hours must be genius . he has no insight or understanding of why a twist is satisfying . this movie is little more than an insipid , endless series of ruses and reversals . it does n't build -lrb- except a viewers annoyance -rrb- and when the final twist arrives , the movie finally offers viewers some mercy and arbitrarily ends it there ; but calling it quits forty minutes earlier would have been just dandy . it is a poorly adapted play , in that the characters never shut up and the film never does anything filmic . in another massive blunder , shaffer was allowed to turn his own play into a script . he does so with a deeply impressed . spoiler ahead : if you think that even the stupidest viewer ca n't figure out that this piece of dreck only has two actors in it the whole time , you are a nerd . i was never surprised that the new character -lrb- serially introduced ... duh ! -rrb- was just caine again . each new gambit is a no-brainer . that the the two actors think the material is deep or well-suited for this hideous treatment only makes the whole train wreck that much more unbearable . if they had filmed olivier and caine masturbating for two hours the results would have been a lot like this movie . i can only imagine that people who rave about this are frustrated actors who relish the idea of playing a part this self-indulgent . every copy of this movie should be tracked down and pitched into a live volcano . i despise this movie . it is not a thoughtful movie . it 's an , dumb movie . caine also appears in the second most grating thriller mystery ever filmed : deathtrap . for the record , the third is the last of sheila , a grating foray into the mystery genre from stephen sondheim .		1		0
spoilers thar be . oh , what a glorious amazing film this could have been . a fascinating idea with a lot of original potential . as usual , it was all flushed away in favor of easy trash . but what is really worse is that the posters -lrb- and trailers to some degree -rrb- still advertised this film for what it could have been . not what it is . it 's basically false advertising . the posters feature london in flames , big ben blazing , an apache helicopter in aerial combat with a dragon . wow ! did this ever happen at any point in the film ? no ! what we do get however is 90 minutes of dirty peasants standing about in a quarry and 10 minutes of very unremarkable dragons huffing and puffing . the idea of them ruling the world is completely lost as we never see anything other than a dirty quarry . the trailer said that the movies takes place in 2084 but it does n't it begins in 2010 -lrb- for no particular reason -rrb- when a young christian bale -lrb- a great actor who is repeatedly contracting himself to bad movies -rrb- hangs about at his mother 's work -lrb- drilling for a new underground tunnel for london 's tube trains -rrb- . he comes across some kind of weird egg in a long , long forgotten cave . this , somehow , reawakens a sleeping dragon -lrb- which must be female if it has laid this egg -rrb- which promptly kills some of the diggers and escapes . right at this moment the movie jumps to several years later ! what a rip off ! the entire story of the dragons taking over the world is just skipped . why ? they threw all of that away ! then they expect us to accept a story in which tough american soldier van zant -lrb- matthew mcconaughey -rrb- travels all the way across the atlantic with his team to wipe out the granddaddy of all dragons , who is located in london . but van zant travels there via a northumberland quarry . makes sense . he says that he would have brought a bigger team but lost most of them over the ocean . why would dragons be out on the ocean ? fishing ? swimming ? i hope they did n't expect us to imagine that they were on some kind of reconnaissance mission . so , anyway , van zant believes that this big dragon is the only male and killing it will lead to the extinction of the . this means that female dragons can only lay female eggs . so where did this male come from if the dragon at the start was female ? even a throwaway line of pure exposition would have covered over this gaping error . and how does all the 3d imaging technology and tanks and helicopters van zant brings with him work ? it would have broke in that space of time . and how did they transport a tank over the atlantic exactly ? and how could his team have lasted so long when they are clearly idiots and get killed right away ? all good questions . no good answers . the fact that it 's only 98 minutes long makes me suspect major changes in post-production . the dvd is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with dolby 5.1 sound -lrb- the r2 release by disney has a dts track -rrb- .		1		0
i saw this movie on television one time when dad was watching it , and i thought it was incompetent , but when i took a look at the original series , i really thought that this is one of the worst movies ever made . michael dunn must be rolling in his grave about what they did to doctor loveless , i was also outraged at what they did to loveless . in the show , michael dunn 's loveless was named quixote loveless , and he was a dwarf . in this vile , ugly , horrible movie , he was changed to arliss loveless and you can amazingly see how he went from being a dwarf to a double amputee confined to a steam powered wheelchair ! this movie i thought was a joke , because i know that will smith and director barry sonnenfeld had previously done men in black , and that movie was great . this , ! why remake a classic ?! it seems that a lot of films that they make out of tv shows have been bad , the only good one that i saw was the movie version of the fugitive . i would rather watch a movie by the worst director of all time , the immortal , edward d. wood jr. than to see this piece of garbage again !!! 1 out of 10		1		0
why gabriel byrne made this load of old tosh is beyond me -- the money must have been good or else he had a gap in his diary or both . a cliché-ridden and suspenseless load of old hokum . the dialog is so dreadfully hackneyed it deserved a razzie . `` have you ever heard of the marie celeste ? '' answer , `` no ... '' er ... like , why have n't they ? they are professional sea sailors . are they deaf or dumb ? do they come from a different planet than i live on ??? that is truly the `` sixty-four million dollar question '' posed by this pile . the ensemble as a whole is pathetic . the supporting cast of non-entities are as beige as is the lead female . really , this film is an insult to the intelligence . crapola of the 1st degree . big thumbs down .		1		0
cary grant is the greatest actor who ever lived , whose mask-like suavity concealed astonishing depths and darkness , and who starred in more genuine masterpieces than any other performer . he retired early because the quality of material put his way was severely diminishing . with this film you can see why - whatever your views on his co-star , the direction is rather too in awe of shallow wealth to be satirical , and the comedy ? let 's say you 're probably familiar with most of the ` jokes ' . grant , in a rare instance of hollywood application of brechtian theory , steps out of the film to grimace at us in agony . there is one excellent fantasy sequence to suggest what might have been .		1		0
a really freakishly bad movie . the scenes were so ridiculous and boneheaded with all the nuance of a world wrestling federation story line . i ca n't believe this is the same guy who made the great horror remake `` dawn of the dead '' . it almost makes me think he was given credit wrongly and someone else did that film . i felt embarrassed for anyone who was in this movie as it went on . the actors probably were laughing at all the stupid scenes they had to do . heck , i felt embarrassed i was watching it ! it brought to mind the image of a 12 year old boy sitting in junior high school class and day dreaming about a movie in his head and thinking to himself this would be so cool and everyone would love my movie ! that is about the maturity level this movie aspires to and delivers .		1		0
to my utter amazement most of the comments concerning this film are somewhat positive . now i really love decent slasher films , and the year 1982 is certainly vintage for those types but this stinker is just plain bad . now i do n't know about most slasher lovers but i 'll name a few who set the bar : halloween : i do n't think there are many people who dispute the fact that halloween is a real horror classic . it 's got many of the slasher film elements but it 's also a really good demonstration of how to make a great horror film with little more than enthusiasm and skill . friday the 13th : a really great slasher film . nowhere near halloween in terms of atmosphere , suspense and overall craftsmanship but the `` woods scenario '' was pretty much perfected here , the kills are great and the `` wooden disposable teenagers '' are presented here basically for the first time . black christmas : a moody , atmospheric sorority slasher that is a bona fide horror classic . here lighting , music , grueling set pieces , good acting and an ok sense of humor ensured that christmas was always going to have a dark side . made before halloween so in some ways this film could be considered the granddaddy of all slashers . now these are three excellent films and belong as top to any horror lover . then there are those copycats and while some are really good -lrb- some friday sequels , some halloween sequels , the burning , my bloody valentine for instance -rrb- many are not at all good . many films fall somewhere in between , displaying some features that are to be admired . films like `` the prowler '' , `` happy birthday to me '' , `` prom night '' , `` dead and buried '' , `` maniac '' and `` the house on sorority row '' have some features working for them , be it atmosphere , gore , solid display of originality or good craftsmanship - something ensures they have good entertainment value . then there are those that have none of that , just copy from better movies and do it in a cheap , unimaginative and talentless fashion . now seriously , those who wo n't find this little outburst of mine helpful will agree to the fact this this film has any of the features that make a solid horror movie . it 's horribly acted with one badly staged set piece swiftly followed by another . the set ups here are painfully bad -lrb- that pizza delivery boy who 's just had his eyes drilled out was a particular fav -rrb- . honestly , i wish there was a comment section here so i could have admirers of the film point out to me what they liked and why . now , maybe i was just in a really foul mood when i watched this and i certainly do n't want to imply that those who like it are any certain type of individuals , hell , i like some movies that get horrible beatings here . but , in my humble opinion , it 's movies like `` slumber party massacre '' that gave slashers a bad name and i 'm just amazed to see that many horror lovers seem to think highly of it .		1		0
the problem with insurrection is that while it would have been a mildly entertaining episode of `` the next generation '' , it did n't have the gravitas to be a motion picture . like many episodes of tng , they start out with kind of a silly premise . you have this whole planet with life saving radiation , with only 600 people living on it , so your solution is to fool the people living there into being relocated , and then demolishing the planet to harvest the supposedly beneficial radiation . never does it occur to anyone that the simple solution would be to simply build a spa on the other side of the planet , and send anyone who needs treatment there . another weakness of the movie is that like all the tng films , it does n't take advantage of the excellent ensemble cast the series enjoyed . once again , half the characters appear in the movie , but they do n't do anything more important than a b-lister would have done . finally , you have f. murray abraham as the villain . now , here you have a guy who can act . i mean , he won an oscar for amadeus . instead , as leader of the `` joan rivers aliens '' , he seems to only be interested in making a lot of menacing threats . i 'm not really sure how a couple hundred geriatric aliens could conquer two other races of `` foreheads of the week '' , but there you are . now , despite all this , i really love star trek . it is one of the fondest memories of my childhood . but this film , like most of the trek produced after 1993 or so , shows the signs of running out of new ideas .		1		0
no other stinker in 1999 could compare to the witless and tasteless experience that was wild wild west , a big-budget bomb of epic proportions that is a total disgrace to the tv western of the same name . will smith is james west , a slick gunslinger who , along with his partner -lrb- kline -rrb- must prevent a political assassination and save a town from destruction . unsatisfying visuals and second-rate special effects only add to the horrible acting and the film 's unclear direction . it is so disappointing to see such good actors wasted in such a terrible mess . 0 out of 5		1		0
but it has nothing to do with isaac asimov 's robot stories , except for the title and the quoting of the three laws of robotics -- which if memory serves , were created by the book 's susan calvin and not dr. lanning . it 's been a lot of years so i could be wrong , of course . this movie is in fact a sort of updated wild wild west with smith cracking wise at all the wrong moments while facing insurmountable odds as what seems like millions of evil robots try to kill him in stupendous cgi fashion . not as bad as wild wild west but nowhere near as as good as men in black or enemy of the state . the characters are cardboard , especially bridget moynihan as calvin and bruce greenwood as the shadowy head of the u.s. robotics , and play second fiddle to the liberal doses of cgi . the nail-biting ending pitting smith and his cohorts against the evil u.s. robotics co. and its endless robot minions has been seen in several other films , by the way , most noticeably virtuosity .		1		0
scientist turns ex-con invisible to steal some atomic material for him , but instead he decides to rob banks . a rather dull drama , that tries to dress itself up as a thriller but just falls flat . it just lacks so much . no suspense , no thrills , no scares , hokey fx and a story that becomes a forgettable bore . worse yet , it has one lousy ending that suggests this was an attempt at an anti-war film . we seem to have missed that message . the cast is ok , but they just do n't have an amusing story to work within . a shame . p.s. the title is a pretty big lie bomb out of ****		1		0
-lrb- actually , there 's not much point in clicking the `` spoiler '' box . there 's literally nothing to spoil . -rrb- about halfway into this film , clive owen 's character delivers a 5 minute monologue about frozen pizza . at that point was the moment i could n't take it anymore and tested myself to see how much longer i could last before turning this garbage off . i lasted about 10 minutes , went `` screw this '' , and turned the damned movie off . first off , this movie has zero plot . a man and a woman bump into each other in different locations , the woman acts as if they 've never met , and then they get into bitch bitch bitch and moan moan moan . yawn ! that 's basically the `` plot '' , if you want to call it that . aside from that , paul giamatti 's in it , and a few other people we may/may not know of . i love giamatti , but not even he can save this dreck from stinking out loud . and i thought halloween ii was the worst movie of 09 . do n't even go near this turgid pile of crap . hell , do n't even touch the blu-ray box on the shelf .		1		0
an absolute hideous production . alexander dumas must have turned over in his grave . despite a terrific cast , the writing is unbelievably bad even with the plush color settings by natalie kalmus . gene kelly dances but in a different way here . he starts off as a complete jerk but soon proves himself to the other musketeers as a great swordsman . i love the way that richelieu is not depicted as a cardinal but as the first minister . always a shame to distort history in hollywood spectacles . lana turner is lovely as countess de winters , even with all her evil . poor june allyson . her simplicity just does her in . only in films could they pull that off . van heflin looked like he was ready for a few more drinks after this film . even the usual vincent price does not really have the opportunity to aggressively show evil here . at the end scene , he is cast off like a natural idiot . frank morgan as the king is his usual buffoon self . angela lansbury as his queen briefly appears and does relatively nothing here . as de winters ' lady in waiting , patricia medina weeps a little . actually , she should have cried more in this atrocious production .		1		0
let me start off with 1 huge flaw daniel craig : he is one of the worlds worst actors & what was wrong with brosnan now look at him he is in c ## p like mamma mia . this film is simply bond playing poker thats all it is bond playing poker . i went to this expecting a film like die another day instead i got a film like bridges of madison county utterly boring & i read other comments `` the best bond has been in years '' , `` craig rocks as bond '' seriously what is all the fuss about its just because he looks like bond he is less animated than sylvester stallone . now for what the film was missing what happened to bond 's witty & funny comments where was q ? where was moneypenny ? where was his aston martin ? -lrb- all cars in this movie were fords -rrb- in conclusion if you are a 007 fan you will be disappointed with this movie very little action just gambling . not my source of home entertainment & is highly overrated .		1		0
quick recipe for ya ... 1 -rrb- take 1 cup of a fairly reasonable horror classic . 2 -rrb- dump the entire contents of the cup down the sink because you wo n't be using any of it . 3 -rrb- add brand teenage drama . 4 -rrb- stir in 1 teaspoon incoherent plot , 4 tablespoons bad cgi , and a pinch of token black guy . 5 -rrb- sift thoroughly to remove any trace of excitement , coolness , scares , gore , or moments that may hold the viewers interest . 6 -rrb- garnish with dog faeces and serve immediately with large steaming platter of `` you 'll never get your money or time back '' rolls . -lrb- chefs note : better still , disregard this recipe and watch the original , unless you hate the original , in which case , disregard this recipe and watch the original anyway ... -rrb-		1		0
director michael lehmann started perfectly with the excellent film , after that promising first work , he made big craps like hudson hawk , airheads and 40 days and 40 , because i said so is not only the worst movie of his career but also an enormous crap which bores and is totally `` film '' is so execrable that i wanted to take my eyes out while i was watching keaton is totally wasted on this film and i think that the only reason she participated here was because she needed some i said so is a pathetic and crappy '' comedy '' that i really want the money i wasted on this crap , the second worst film of 2007 -lrb- for the moment , the worst one is license to wed -rrb- .		1		0
i understand that wes craven needed money desperately in order to eat warm food , but he went too far . `` the hills have eyes part ii '' is probably the worst sequel to any horror movie . yes , i even prefer `` exorcist ii : the heretic '' to this crap . the movie starts the same as `` texas chainsaw massacre ii '' with a prologue that tells what happened in the previous movie and reminds us that `` the hills still have eyes '' . after the prologue , bobby has flashbacks from the first movie ; now , this scenes have background music . his psychologist tells him that everything 's okay and blah , blah . he is now in a biker gang -lrb- for sporting motives -rrb- . but he decides not to enter a competition or something like that in the same hills where his family met cruel fates . so his friends return to the hills , in company of beauty ! who may be now 30 years old . beauty has also flashbacks ! and still remembers how she almost kills pluto . wow , this is something new ... a dog with flashbacks . but wait , the movie continues with extreme cheese ! the plot even gets stupid . how could bobby fell in love with the cannibal girl from the original ? she was way hot back in 77 i must say in his defense . anyways , the gang returns to the hills -lrb- duh -rrb- and one by one these kids are killed by pluto -lrb- still as ugly as in the original , or even uglier ! -rrb- , lizzard , and company . let me say that the death scenes are cheesy as you can get . not even like in `` friday the 13th '' . one of the boys is smashed by a giant rock in a super cheesy scene . the rest of the death scenes involve stabbing and stuff . how could i help this movie ? there 's no possible way . i ca n't recommend it because it 's at the bottom of the worst . the fact that it uses music from `` friday the 13th part 2 '' makes it even more a slasher movie than exploitation . yes , this sequel is a 100 % slasher flick . it has terrible acting , horrible gore , stupid dialogs , scenes , etc. . there is n't something good about it . some camera angles even copy `` friday the 13th part 2 . '' for example , when lizzard is holding a machete but you can only watch his boots . the ending of the movie is really bad . the gang got dumber and slower with time , and they could n't even escape from the burning place ... now , this is one of the worst slashers ever . i 'm not exaggerating . this is a pathetic `` friday the 13th '' rip-off but with characters from the original `` hills have eyes '' -lrb- the same plot , characters , gore , music , acting , even cinematography ! -rrb- . shame on you mr. craven . you 've done enough harm to the genre .		1		0
this film was the comedy of the year ! seriously , i 've seen comedies this year , but nothing made me laugh harder than this . there was an unintentional joke just about every 5 minutes or so ! and the audience in my theater seemed to agree with me on that . i was never the only one laughing . this takes the place of `` the happening '' as the single worst movie i 've seen in a long , long time . the acting was so ridicules it was like they were reading their scripts for the first time as they read their lines . overall : - it gave boring a new level . out of the 110 minutes , 90 were either a talking scene or a scene of awkward staring . it reminded me of napoleon . there were literately 2 minutes left in the movie and people could n't bear it anymore and walked out ! - it gave cheesy horror a new meaning . at one point the entire audience burst out laughing at how cheesy one scare scene was . -lrb- it was the scene with the dead man turning his head . -rrb- every other scare scene had at least one person laughing other than me . and there were like 50 cheap , cheesy scare scenes . - 57 clichés ! i sat there and counted every cliché and it added up to 57 ! add to that : the plot and characters were from movies like `` the ring '' , `` the grudge '' , and `` the eye '' . exact same plot lines . exact . - gore ? what gore ? a chick rips her jaw off , but the cgi is so laughably bad it was no more effective than old godzilla movies . plus , have n't we seen jaw ripping in pg-13 movies like `` the grudge '' , anyway ? there was no gore in this movie . none . beside the horrid things i just mentioned , all the good parts were typical . typical atmosphere , typical exposition , typical mystery -lrb- that was from `` the ring '' -rrb- , typical characters -lrb- i ca n't name how many times i hear in a horror movie , `` i have to save my family ! '' -rrb- , typical story layout , typical camera angles , typical everything . the only things that were n't typical were the things it got horridly , utterly wrong . go see this movie if `` pineapple express '' does n't make you laugh enough , and you 'll have a blast . if comedy is n't your thing and you actually think this is a horror movie , may i suggest an episode of barney to give you shivers ?		1		0
idea inspired by the grim horror of texas chainsaw massacre fails miserably in every sense to even vaguely emulate that classic . i 'd heard a little about this movie - such as the extremely squeamish gore levels and pain contained therein , and always enjoying dramatic and edgy cinema , decided to give it a spin . i have never regretted watching a movie more in my life ; this is up there with those luminary shambles such as resident evil , cabin fever and darkness falls . if i 'd known this was from the hand of eli roth , the same man responsible for the dire and truly pitiful cabin fever , there is no way i 'd have committed myself to wasting 2 hours on it . hostel is set out in the eastern bloc of europe , namely the small nation of slovakia , after initially being set in amsterdam , the netherlands . a group of 3 friends are enjoying the hedonistic pleasures of the flesh offered by the seedy districts of holland 's capital , before a chance encounter with an apparent pimp sets them on course to travelling east where a hostel hosting the most beautiful and sexually precocious women is apparently situated . unfortunately for them , it is also the location for a torture chamber , and they have no idea of what visceral depravity and horror awaits . as one can clearly tell , this is inspired by the style of texas chainsaw massacre - a ` group ' of conspirators try to lure unsuspecting victims into a dungeon in which vicious and unspeakable hells lurk , carried out out by psychotic . regrettably it shares only that similarity with tcm and nothing else ; a truly appalling , shallow , and thoroughly disjointed plot which commits the cardinal sin of being fundamentally boring completely undermines this movie 's chances of being half decent . there is simply no point here ; once the first sequence of torture is over , you find yourself wondering why the hell you 're watching this drivel . i was very close to quitting entirely , but it switched elsewhere , deluding me into thinking there might actually be a moral or purpose concealed within . but there simply was n't . this mess was a monumental hash - implausible , pointless , bereft of originality and poorly conceived . plus if you only watch the first 30 or so minutes , you 'd think it was practically soft porn . the one saving grace is that the acting was actually ok , and nowhere near as pitiful as cabin fever 's , for example . eli roth clearly can not do horror , and i plead with him to refrain from trying again .		1		0
after spending almost two hours watching this movie , you have to surely be left with one question raging inside your head : what in the world went wrong here ? the story seems as if it should be funny : an unorthodox marriage preparation course run by an unorthodox minister , who 's played by robin williams -lrb- someone who - although his work is n't always to my taste - can nevertheless be pretty funny most of the time . -rrb- you settle in and expect some reasonable comedy . instead , what you end up with is a sheer , unmitigated disaster . it 's not funny , it features one of the most irritating child actors -lrb- josh flitter -rrb- i 've ever come across -lrb- ok , let 's be fair to the kid - it was his character - the `` junior minister '' or something - that was irritating -rrb- and the rest of the cast -lrb- including williams -rrb- does n't come across as much more endearing . having just watched this -lrb- at least when i was n't dozing off , as i was continually through the whole thing -rrb- i honestly can not think of anything good to say about it . watching it was simply a dismal experience . without anything good to say about it , how can i give it anything more than a 1/10 ?		1		0
there is not one part of the shooter you have n't seen before and done considerably better . it borrows so liberally from past espionage action movies that it sometimes feels as if you 've seen this film before . the direction is pedestrian at best . the opening establishing shots are done using cheesy cgi . if the director ca n't do a simple establishing shot of countryside without having to resort to computer generated effects it does n't really say much about his talent does it ? the actors seem to have a major problem with diction . i had to use the english subtitles ! mark wahlberg his lines at such a rate that all the exposition is lost and danny glover has suddenly developed a disturbing speech impediment . of course all the girls are hot . a lonely window living in a dump turns out to be hot and without a boyfriend ! the under used rhona mitra is a hard-nosed f.b.i. agent and she is extremely hot . hollywood stereotypes abound ! with such a lack of originally this film is actually quite boring . if you want a good intelligent action film then watch `` three days of the condor '' or `` blood diamond '' .		1		0
mike myers is a nice guy , but he 's falling into a rut . he has dispensed with the pretense of acting for sleep walking through his roles . while he 's not as stupid as jim carrey when he 's the same ground , he is equally annoying . in the cat in the hat , myers does what he 's done before in most of his films of late and that is to be silly in the most annoying manner and voice he can think of . the idea of turning dr seuss ' book about the events on a rainy day into a full length feature was not the brightest idea , simply because there is n't enough material to fill the film out to anything approaching 90 minutes . the film makers did n't learn from grinch which only worked when it dealt with material from the book , unfortunately in the case of the cat that material is all over the place , the film is mostly new material so it just does n't work . the film also suffers from the biggest problem with adapting seuss - his stuff never looks right off the printed page . its never truly real so you never believe . the film is n't bad , it is n't good , it just is . as the cat and the kids go through their paces things happen but its completely uninvolving . if you must waste your time seeing this rent it first .		1		0
so , it 's years after the first film connor macleod has grown old and fixing the earth 's ozone layer as he has the prize , but when in the first movie we where told he was from earth , he was n't . he was from zeist , and er , he was involved in some civil war there and banished to earth , er , and so was ramirez but like 1500 years earlier and er , he is n't immortal there but he is here and michael ironside is bored that he 's old and immortal and wants to kill him and , er , according to the back of the video cover , connor macleod is back tracking -lrb- tracking ?!!! wtf !!! -rrb- having seen the first film at the pictures i was sure this could not fail to at least be okay , boy was i wrong . as an idea it 's almost as bad as `` good will hunting 2 : hunting season '' but at least that was a spoof , this is real . to be fair as a film on its own it only sucks really bad and maybe that would be okay , but as the sequel to highlander ? the film might as well be called terminator 2 because it has much relevancy to that film series as it does to this one . the acting is tired and ineffective , much like the direction which seems to largely be about how many windows they can blow up as there was n't enough glass shattered in the first film . the story and script are abysmal and just re-write and ignore every little scrap of info we gleaned from the first film , it 's almost as though the writers have picked up the video of the first film , read the back and thought , `` that sounds good , let 's write a sequel ! '' without even watching the first film ! this is without doubt the worst sequel of all time and avoid at all costs , the rating is higher than it should be . addendum : interesting point of fact , the first film , like raiders of the lost ark , got bad reviews from a number of critics , unlike raiders , it also failed at the box office but lived again through home video , the poster for this film was full of reviewers plaudits , but the film was terrible , the lesson of the story ? film critics do not understand how to review action films . beware the film critics . thus endeth the lesson .		1		0
be kind rewind just does n't have much going for it . i think i remember laughing maybe once or twice , but not enough for me to call this a worthy comedy . in reality , it just pretends to be a comedy ; it 's really a drama . and a cliché , overdone drama at that . i 'll start with the actual entertainment value . it 's low . i was too bored to laugh . when i was n't bored , it was n't funny . i actually commend this film for trying to be something other than the typical romantic comedy or typical sex comedy , but , really , it just was n't entertaining . the script did n't even allow for jack black to do anything he 's funny at doing -- at all . he just seems more like a prop the film used to draw attention to itself , but never gave him very many lines at all . what the movie did do was turn into a boring drama that almost , to me , seemed like another overdone civil rights movie . i do n't call that endearing . i call that annoying and false advertisement . how is this the same movie the critics all called `` original '' ? overall , there are some parts scattered through the middle of the movie , but that 's about it . the rest is pretty poor . go watch nacho libre or school of rock if you want to see jack black in better movies . even in this movie , he was the only redeeming factor . 0/10		1		0
bruckheimer is guilty of fronting some of the most stupid movies in existence -- one look at his resume confirms that . tony scott is just as guilty -lrb- as director -rrb- of churning out tripe . they 've conspired before , so why would we expect anything worthwhile as a result ? we 've seen it all before ; this is basically `` inner space '' plus the intrigues and strained marriage subplot from `` the firm '' . lots of long panning shots ... dark , underdeveloped and jerky , as is most of scott 's work . the problem here is not the moronic plot , or that it 's about evil government ; in fact , it tries hard to present the facade of being politically neutral . the problem is , the whole thing is laid out for dummies , with absolutely no ambiguity about who 's good , who 's bad , or what arc each character will follow within the story . in short , who cares ? how are we entertained at all by this ? ah , there 's the rub . the supposed entertainment value comes from the illumination of the star power , and hence it 's built from the actors up . everything is designed to play to each celebrity 's strength : smith as a lawyer -lrb- so that we perceive him here as royalty -rrb- , in order to meet hollywood 's affirmative action quotas in casting , yet he 's tough and jive when necessary , so as to pass authenticity muster with the audience . hackman is the real reason this exists though ; huge chunks of `` the conversation '' were ripped off in order to make this -lrb- with none of the storytelling brains -rrb- , so that he can give us more of his glum authoritarianism . whole sections of this obviously try to see and hear the narrative in the same manner as coppola , but scott does n't have a clue . most insulting , though , is how the ethnicities are stereotyped . the chinese couple is depicted as befuddled . the ` italian-american ' depictions involve men slathered with hair grease , leather blazers , wife beater shirts , lots of guns , boiling pasta , and exploding jars of sauce . sizemore , as the boss , is flanked by a fat , dutiful wife and fat , cheeky kids . in order for us to accept regina king as the wife , she has to be hollywood 's conception of a ` strong black woman ' -lrb- whatever that is -rrb- , propped up by her status as an ` aclu lawyer ' , yet she is hysterical , jive and sexually compliant -- they could n't find a dumber actress if they tried . is this any match for `` no way big clock '' ? comparing leading black men in film , is smith any match for denzel washington , who 's done smart things like `` fallen '' , or for larry fishburne , who can support things on the order of magnitude of the entire `` matrix '' series by himself ? nope ... all in all , it 's the usual collection of deeply insulting , intellectually vacant , preachy , pandering nonsense , that owes its existence purely to the theft of ideas from better predecessors .		1		0
the movie starts at the carpathian mountains in 1975 . we see three men enter some remote cave but then they 're caved in and something attacks . by the way -- this has nothing to do with the rest of the film . i swear it was added to pad the film to at least 90 minutes . then we cut to present day -lrb- well -- 2005 -rrb- where a bunch of scientists , cave dwellers and divers go into the cave to examine it . they 're all attractive , in great shape , pretty young -lrb- 20s & 30s -rrb- and have no personalities whatsoever -- or acting talent . they 're then attacked by monsters , a cave in traps them , and they have to find a way out while battling monsters . boy was this bad ! the acting was even worse than you 'd expect for a stupid horror film . i ca n't totally blame the actors for their acting -- the script is against them all the way . cole hauser winds hands down as the worst one . eddie cibrian , morris chestnut and piper perabo have been much better in other films . the attack scenes are pretty bad . they 're shot with such frenzied camera movements it 's impossible to tell what 's going on . also there 's very little blood or gore -- looks like it was cut down for that all important pg-13 rating . most of the movie has characters going through cave after cave after cave -- gets boring real quick . i did find it amusing how quickly they get over anyone 's death . the final 20 minutes or so are impressive when we see the creatures -lrb- which are neat -rrb- -- the violence and action amps up and it gets exciting , but it does n't excuse the one hour of boredom you have to go through to get to this . it also has a `` twist '' ending which suggests a -lrb- god help me -rrb- sequel . considering this bombed we can safely rest assured that it wo n't happen . just dreadful . a 1 all the way .		1		0
crowd of unknowns in cheap and miserable alleged horror which fails to achieve any single objective a horror is responsible for . in summary , a group of teens/early 20s pop into the woods in ireland -lrb- why ireland -rrb- and are chaperoned by their ` host ' -lrb- a sort of ` ex ' of one of the group -rrb- for the purpose of taking magic mushrooms in lieu of searching for the ultimate high . two events then have things taking a turn for the worst ; a ghost story about the surrounding area , plus one of the group -lrb- the one -rrb- taking a particularly powerful mushroom . and thereafter it is basically the young beautiful people being picked off , one by one while ` flashback ' interlude featuring all manner of creepy looking entities . this movie is garbage , truly awful . probably the worst horror i 've ever suffered , and that it scores over 5 on imdb amazes me . for a horror/slasher it commits two cardinal sins ; one , it is criminally boring , and two there is no actual slashing . yes , that 's right , not only does it bore you rigid with a disjointed story featuring epileptic direction , but it manages to completely forget that it 's supposed to the viewer with chills and gore . it fails to do this with aplomb . there is only one scene with reasonable blood , and that has nothing to do with a slashing . the direction too is woeful - the tale is boring enough without the fragmented delivery of the whole piece - either ponderous , confusing , or outright ridiculous , it does not manage to look convincing for a second . there are so many other chastising things i could say about this drivel , but the fact that no horror movie should ever be boring or confusing says it all . as does the almost entire blanket absence of actual horror . avoid .		1		0
this film is about the romance between a failed shoe designer and am air hostess . the pacing is lethally slow . there are so many unnecessary scenes in the film . do we really need to watch what orlando bloom is watching on tv for several minutes ? the dialog is terrible . `` not goodbye , but just goodbye '' , says jessica biel 's character . what does that even mean ? kirsten dunst 's character is annoying , while orlando bloom 's character is a cardboard cutout . the plot is poorly told , tedious and long . the jokes are not even funny . i mean , are really really supposed to find a 4 way phone conversation funny ? a happy groom suddenly turns tearful is not funny either . this film is bad . avoid it !		3		0
no need to recap a familiar plot line . one more close-up of that slobbering spider 's mouth and i would have lost my lunch . to heck with his stinging tail , what this ugly critter does instead is drool the audience to death with a ton of disgusting studio saliva . note to the great effects man willis o'brien -- please , would n't the budget allow more than one sloppy close-up endlessly repeated . i 'll bet snack counters did zero business during the 1957 run . nothing new here for us giant insect fans that them -lrb- 1954 -rrb- did n't do a lot better . okay , the cavernous nesting area is pretty scary and well done ; plus , lovely mara corday delivers a lively and fetching turn as the love interest . but consider the downside -- some supporting actors appear narcotized ; a flabby 90-minute run time that needs a diet ; a slack director and a meandering script , that lack intensity ; and finally , a `` black '' scorpion that appears nothing more than an unprocessed film negative -lrb- what happened there -rrb- . just as puzzling are those terrible back-screen traveling shots during the jeep rides -- for a production heavy on effects , why not more attention to this basic technique . sure , the movie has all the elements , yet crucially , fails to combine them effectively . i just wish the results were good enough to qualify as good campy fun , but they 're not . unfortunately , the movie 's just forgettably bad .		3		0
man , who allows scripts like this to be made into movies ? is it really that funny to hear a jewish guy speak in black slang and an old white guy pretend he 's african american ? why did n't they just put steve martin in blackface ? this film is far more offensive than al jolson singing ` mammy , ' let me tell you . i feel so embarrassed for martin . he 's far too talented to be appearing in sh * t like this . queen latifah provides some of the energy that should have been in the script , but she does n't have the talent to save this train wreck . this film was very successful , but i beg you , hollywood , please do n't shove a sequel down our throats . you ca n't blame the executives , however . the audience is directly culpable for dreck like this , and every single person who gave this film a dime should feel ashamed . 3/10 .		3		0
besides having two punctuations in one simple title , yours , mine , and ours has to be one of the most annoying remakes i 've seen in recent years . friday the 13th was a pretty annoying one , but because of context not content . how can anyone stay sane when there are eighteen kids running around , hyper speed for ninety tedious minutes ? jo frost would lose her mind in this ruckus . yours , mine , and ours is a remake of the 1968 film of the same name . having never seen the original , from what i understand both films have eighteen kids , and the only major differences are the actors . lucille ball and henry fonda are replaced with rene russo and dennis quaid along with the kids which i wo n't take time explaining . but lets just say that coming from a teenager who does n't want kids , this film was absolutely frightening . frank beardsley is a us coast guard admiral widower who is managing eight kids . helen north works as a designer and she has ten kids . frank and helen where sweethearts in high school , and are reunited after 25 years . after learning about each others kids they come up with the brilliant idea to marry and raise a family of eighteen . my first thought would be get the f ** k out ! of course when raising eighteen kids of all different age groups the first thing that should come to your mind is let the kids meet and see if they form a tight bond . if not , maybe marriage is n't going to work . nope . not necessary . without even consulting the kids -lrb- if you call a five minute estimated family talk when no kids can change the folks mind a consulting then okay -rrb- they make the indulgent move of marrying anyway . what a fun house . no one but the parents have any say in something that will effect their own life . so naturally , when the kids first meet everything goes haywire and fighting , bickering , hitting , beating , and arguing come constantly . the biggest problem is that frank is -lrb- pun intended -rrb- and helen lets the kids have freedom . disciplined kids , free kids . not seeing a very good connection . maybe they should 've reconsidered marriage , and production on this film as well . the plus for the film was seeing both drake bell and miranda cosgrove in it . they worked for years on drake & josh and i 've always favored both of them . i lost touch and interest with drake bell after he quit drake & josh , and as far as miranda cosgrove goes , once the first ten or so episodes of icarly aired ... lets leave it at that . one thing that angered me more than the film itself was cartoon network , the network i watched the film on . not the fact that it was loaded with commercials , but how two big `` c '' and `` n '' mascots were popping up during the commercials . we 're led to believe these bulky , headless annoyances are watching the movie with us and just getting off track ? why not make it believable and have the mascots actually say something that happens in the movie rather than have them ranting about turkey leftovers and football . also the number of commercials making the viewers aware about `` exercising '' and `` eating a healthy meal '' uncountable and an even bigger annoyance than the mascots . has childhood obesity become that much of a big deal that commercials alerting viewers of it 's occurrence need to be on every kid 's network . if kids are watching a movie on cartoon network , do you think they 'll drop everything -lrb- in the middle of the movie '' and dash outside to the nearest park and play a game ? logical , like the mascot 's heads , is absent yours , mine , and ours is what you would expect of a remake . a loud , overly cliché , annoying state of affairs that has dennis quaid being hit off a boat , in the head , or into a can of paint one too many times to be passable . i 've been known to enjoy slapstick like the works of carrot top and chris farley , although i have standards set for where i want my slapstick . being hit in the head five times or more in a single movie is way past my standards . starring : dennis quaid , rene russo , sean faris , jerry o'connell , drake bell , miranda cosgrove , lil ' jj , danielle panabaker . directed by : raja gosnell .		3		0
what 's the best way to get out from underneath your famous father 's shadow ? how about write and direct a film about a teenager afflicted with vagina dentata ? yeah , that should do the trick . mitchell lichtenstein , son of famed pop artist roy lichtenstein , deciding to delve into feature film with the horror/comedy teeth certainly thought so . it is definitely unlike anything i 've ever seen and uniquely original , but that is n't necessarily a good thing . besides the premise being inventive and the second half of the film eliciting some genuine laughs , i kind of disliked this whole crazy affair . i 'm guessing that the acting was intentionally amateurish , but even so , the story itself is weak and under-developed . it might have been effective as a short film , ridding itself of the very laborious first act that crawled along , unsure of whether it wanted to make us laugh , and therefore seeming unintentionally funny rather than purposely subversive . more uncomfortable than anything else , i never knew exactly how to take what was happening on screen until it was almost over . lichtenstein seems to want to give us some back-story into the psyche of dawn o'keefe , a young woman who has no idea what makes up a normal vagina . her school system is puritanical to the point where a huge starred circle covers the necessary diagram to enlighten her on its page of the health book and it appears that she almost believes her ` affliction ' is something all girls go through . taking a vow , or i should say promise , of celibacy until marriage , it is as if once her plastic red ring is replaced by a golden band , the teeth lying hidden away inside her genitalia will dissolve , allowing her to continue living just like anyone else . admittedly , the brouhaha surrounding its release in 2007 made me aware of what was actually happening to the lead , so it only took the early flashback of dawn and soon-to-be stepbrother brad in a blow-up swimming pool to understand the intricacies of her condition . to then go through forty-five minutes of her being chaste and innocent only made me impatient for the horrors that its billing sold me on . maybe the exposition is relevant to believe the evolution from naïve schoolgirl to preying mantis , but it does n't excuse the plodding pacing used to explain it all . then there is the very heavy-handed work in pretty much every facet of the work . it could be the fact i was still wondering whether i was supposed to be laughing or not , but the music cues are so cheesy . on the most innocuous moments that only hold a sense of danger because we know what sort of evil lies between dawn 's legs , you will hear a menacing percussive note to inflict a sense of horror film dread . being inside the joke , however , makes the punctuation more tongue-in-cheek joke than any sort of jarring sense of anticipation . as for visually , we are inundated constantly with the visage of two black smoke pumping nuclear power plant silos in the distance . we get it man -- the chemicals and radiation mutated her mother 's egg and created the man-eating gene shown very effectively in a fun opening credit sequence . and there is also the unfortunate poor editing transitions . some are so abrupt you begin to wonder why lichtenstein even showed the scene before as a few five minute set-pieces do nothing to add to the plot except give one more messed up moment in this demented world . once the story gets moving , though , when dawn finally sees what her weapon can truly accomplish , the laughs become confident and the enjoyment factor increases greatly . it is just a little too late . jess weixler is left to languish in mediocrity for the first two-thirds , playing the virgin too over-the-top and very `` one tree hill '' clean teen-like , especially being opposite the awkward performance from hale appleman as her boyfriend tobey . when the two are together there is absolutely no sexual tension because their stares and deep breathing and uncertainty overpower any connection . rather then want the two to be together and see her lash out in fear , we just wait and watch , hoping that she will eventually draw blood . that is why anyone would bother with the film anyway ... to satisfy their bloodlust in an interesting way they have never seen before . josh pais 's gynecologist helps bring the story into this genre territory with a hilariously funny moment of karmic beauty for the sexual abuser he is and soon dawn becomes in control of her bodily actions . this is when weixler shines , the perfect mix of innocent country girl with an edge of malice and a vengeful heart against the male sex . it is this later work that makes me second-guess what i initially thought was horrible acting at the start . john hensley 's brad tries his best to make the beginning tolerable , but even his psychopath ca n't do it alone . the first victim of dawn 's at such an early age he does n't remember the incident that scarred his index finger -- `` i think she bit me , '' is all he can conjure up -- the guy 's mental instability is fully formed . adamantly refusing natural intercourse with his girlfriend , we can assume it is due to the deep rooted , subconscious fear of teeth being where they should n't be , even though he appears to tell himself that he is saving it for a long awaited chance at his stepsister . tattooed , pierced , and very funny in his ability to be just plain mean , his comic relief is all that saves the film to eventually reach its stride with monster unleashed . only then is the fun sustained with teeth 's pure absurdity and much more graphic gore moments than anticipated . you do get to see the aftermaths of dawn 's dentata flourishes , so be prepared . or just avoid the film completely and hope lichtenstein 's sophomore effort , happy tears , fares better .		3		0
fans of the incredible hulk rejoice ! this is exactly how the hulk should have been portrayed five years ago . i still have nightmare visions of nick nolte flailing his arms about as bruce 's father , followed by his prison photo . and no one can blame ang lee for wanting to quit movies entirely after that film . he ended up getting revenge on all of us for brokeback mountain but i 'm straying from the real topic here ... fans of movie-making and films rejoice ? well ... this ` reboot ' is a better version than the original but not by much . there are elements of conflict , terror , action , and tension , all crammed into a melodramatic musical score with somewhat way too obvious -lrb- hence , boring -rrb- direction and screenplay . what keeps the incredible hulk from a total belly-up is edward norton , william hurt and tim roth can still pull a heck of a performance in spite of everything . the incredible hulk 's updated look deserves a note too , but five years later , it is to be expected . i 'm just happy the hulk 's back i guess . the climactic bout between the abomination and hulk failed to deliver . like the movie itself , the fight was a laughable mess at most , ending in the silliest of fashion . unless you 're a fan of the series , i would not care to recommend it .		3		0
this was more of a love story than one about an angel who comes down here to earth , although both angles of that story are given a good share of the movie . if i took this movie to heart , as someone who knows and believes the bible , i would have canned it pretty quick , but i do n't think the general atmosphere was either mean-spirited or blasphemous . it was just ludicrous or just plain stupid . i mean , john travolta as a grubby angel ? smoking ? scratching his groin ? quoting the beatles ? a `` warring angel '' who knows nothing about heaven ? an angel who flirts with all the women ? yes , it 's all absurd and certainly biblically - incorrect . i could tolerate all that but i do n't know how many people , whatever beliefs they hold , who could stand a boring film which this turned out to be during the second half of it . it begins to drag when the romance begins between william hurt and andie macdowell . some of the dialog during that romance is so stupid it 's insulting to any discriminating viewer . this is another nora film . man , i ca n't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed . at least she 's consistent .		3		0
` interview with the vampire : the vampire chronicles ' has got to be one of the worst movies that has multiple star actors in it , at least one of the worst that i have watched anyway . acting is terrible , yes you did n't misread this , acting is the most fatal flaw of this movie , its absolutely silly and dumb . story is ok , considering that this is a vampire movie and we all saw almost everything there is to see about them in hundreds of movies . tom cruise and brad pitt just seem absolutely silly and corny to me in this movie , i mean come on just pay attention to how they act in almost every scene and it wont take you long to realize the same thing i realized almost straight away . if you 're fan of vampire movies you should probably see this , actually everybody should see this and see how a movie with star cast can totally fail to deliver absolutely anything to the audience , except maybe laughing tears on some scenes that were not meant to be funny but they just are cause of the way they are acted and cause the screenplay is pretty awful .		3		0
after sofia coppola 's successful films the virgin suicides and lost in translation , many movie-goers awaited her next masterpiece with baited breath . taking on the life of marie antoinette is no small feat , too . here is someone who 's short life and reign as queen of france ended in fashion , but affected france 's government for years to come . it is unfortunate that a few factors ruined this film , causing it to get booed at the cannes film festival and leaving it with lackluster gains at the box office . but many who were displeased with this rendition of her life have rightly showed their displeasure . i 'm not going to give you a history lesson , as i 'm assuming most of you know about the life and times of marie antoinette . but i will give you some idea what to expect if you watch the film . first , expect to enjoy the great sets and costumes . any gal who loves to go shoe shopping will probably drool over the number of scenes involving footwear -lrb- perhaps too many -rrb- and their excellent designs . heading from the feet upward , the dresses , wigs , fans , and are also very nicely arranged and in accordance with the times . the film was shot on-location in versailles , so no one should be able to complain about the authenticity of the sets . but from here the production takes a serious nosedive . the screenplay is riddled with boring and absent scenes -lrb- from louis and marie eating many silent breakfasts , to a complete lack of what was going on outside the palace walls -rrb- . the end of marie 's life is run through in slipshod fashion , as if a race were on to finish the movie on schedule . then , of course , there 's the music . incorporating modern day music with historical elements has been done before . the one that most comes to mind is a knight 's tale . although not the pinnacle of film success , a knight 's tale had some catchy tunes that went along nicely with the story . but with marie antoinette , the connections are distant at best . can you imagine songs from bow wow wow and the cure infusing a film ? if you 're like me , this is a bit hard to swallow . what happens in the end is we get a movie that is all pomp and no circumstance ; visually appealing on almost every level but sorely lacking a decent script that would allow the acting to shine through . i 'll give kirsten dunst a few claps of applause for her portrayal , as she made the best out of a pretty awful screenplay , but that 's about it . a bit of a snoozer , i 'm afraid .		3		0
the first twenty minutes of `` atm '' play like a particularly bad romantic comedy , the three leads spouting dialogue so inane and amateurish that it 's downright embarrassing to listen to . we have david -lrb- brian geraghty -rrb- , a young investment banker . there 's his friend and coworker , corey -lrb- josh peck -rrb- , the vulgar , obnoxious boozehound who pressures david into finally approaching the girl he has wanted to ask out . this would be emily -lrb- alice eve -rrb- , who has accepted a job with a different company . this is david 's last chance . and so he takes it at the office christmas party . at around midnight , just as emily is about to hail a cab , david offers to drive her home . corey , being the annoying leech he is , hitches along , as he has no money to pay for a cab . during the ride , he browbeats david into making a stop at an indoor atm machine , as he wants to withdraw money so that they can make yet another stop at an all-night pizza joint . the three find themselves within the atm , and that 's when the thriller portion of the film starts . unfortunately , this change in tone does n't improve the dialogue much , and it sure as hell does nothing for the plot , the theme , or the characterizations . just as it 's discovered that corey 's card is defective , all three of them notice a hulking figure standing a short distance from the door . his face is concealed beneath a bulky hooded parka . for a time , all he does is just stand and stare . david , emily , and corey are nervous . he ca n't get in , because the door can only open by swiping your atm card through an electronic lock . should they call the police ? they ca n't ; the only one among them who has a cell phone is emily , and she left it in the car . the hooded figure turns and spots a homeless man with a dog . to show that he 's serious , he walks over to the homeless man and beats his head into a bloody pulp on the frozen asphalt . and so begins an awkward psychological torture test , one that repeatedly demonstrates shaky logic and severe gaps in tension and plausibility . david and emily learn that , because corey 's card is defective , the only way he could have gotten in was if the door was unlocked . sure enough , david is able to open it without using his card . they think the killer outside is n't aware of this . perhaps he is n't . however , the three trapped victims will repeatedly open the door and call out for help within his line of sight , so it 's reasonable to assume that at some point he would figure out that all he has to do is pull the door open . but it seems he 's far too busy using tools and crowbars to try and pry a back door open . he eventually cuts off the heat to the kiosk , and so the three victims spend the rest of the film freezing -- which is strange because we so rarely see foggy breath emanating from their mouths . to be sure , the hooded man will kill a few other convenient and unlucky passersby before the sun finally rises . meanwhile , david , emily , and corey desperately search for a way to attract the attention of authorities . emily tries writing the word `` help '' on the window with her lipstick before approaching an atm and punching in david 's pin number backwards . apparently , she once heard that doing so would alert the police somehow . david tries smashing one of the two atm machines with a garbage can , as he heard a similar rumor about alerting the police . when the hooded man finally resorts to flooding the kiosk with a fire hose , it 's determined that the only course of action left is to set off the sprinkler alarm . i 'll let you work through the logic of this idea . do n't think about it too hard , now . the action is occasionally interrupted by the leads ' declining mental states , their panic and fear devolving into paranoia and distrust . this is especially true of david and corey ; how they ever became friends is beyond me . without a believable premise and a decent screenplay , you 'd think geraghty , eve , and peck would have tried just a little bit harder to convince us that their characters are in a state of emotional breakdown . alas , their performances are about one rung up on the ladder from an amateur high school production . at this level , we find we do n't much care about their characters -- or , more accurately , their almost complete lack of intelligence . consider the scene after corey tries to run away and gets injured in the process . with the hooded man busy at the back of the kiosk , david and emily have the chance to leave . and so they do . they spot corey and take him ... back into the kiosk ? all leads to a maddeningly unsatisfying ending , as it supplies us with everything except an explanation . when a thriller goes this route , it tends be because the filmmakers are making an attempt at some twisted existential metaphor . in this case , i think it 's a simple case of laziness . despite this , the filmmakers keep the audience guessing all the way through the end credits , which are intercut with bizarre close-ups of plastic sheets and schematic drawings . in case you 're wondering , this is roughly the same way the movie began . a framing device . how quaint . `` atm '' is a movie that underachieves at the basic conceptual level , so i guess it was too much to hope that it would somehow be redeemed by dialogue , location , theme , or performance . and is it just me , or is there something inherently wrong with releasing a film at the start of spring ?

i did n't really care for this movie . it was n't entertaining enough ; nothing more than a silly video game . some how this guy , sam , goes into a video game -lrb- which i still do n't understand how he got there -rrb- to find his father , kevin . it seems many years ago , kevin invented this video game world and got trapped there . clu is the alter ego version of kevin and he oversees the games . the games use motorcycles and frisbees that are used to defeat the opponents . the opponents shatter when hit because they are n't real . some girl whom was supposed to be special some how rescues sam and takes him to his real father . from there , sam devises a plan to escape through a portal . final verdict : it was too confusing for me . there are many better sci-fi movies then this : do n't waste your time .		3		0
the new world received good reviews from several well known critics and the trailers seemed intriguing . unfortunately this was the least enjoyable film i 've seen in a long time . i felt i had a duty to warn the public about this slow , boring , incoherent and dimwitted work of genius . in 1607 , three small english ships arrive in what became jamestown . life is hard and john smith -lrb- colin farrell -rrb- befriends the local indians , especially the chief 's daughter . after a while , smith is given another assignment by the king of england and he disappears from the movie . john rolfe -lrb- chritian bale -rrb- arrives and becomes friendly with pocohantas . they build a house together and become farmers . at the request of the king , they leave america and spend time in england . while this is going on the english are exploiting the indians and treating them badly . this is a well known story , but the director managed to construct a movie with little plot or dialog . the actors mostly mumble at each other . the lack of dialog makes it difficult to understand the characters or what motivates them . occasionally the actors would reveal their inner thoughts with pretentious and unintelligible monologues . the pace is glacial and has random shots of trees , fields and water . characters are inserted into the story with no introduction . who was john smith and why did the king of england regard him so highly . why did his fellow colonists treat him so badly . we are told smith was a professional soldier but he did n't seem to be a man with any natural authority , charisma or leadership qualities . farrell looked confused and depressed , perhaps he was thinking about his recent career choices . his accent was a strange mixture of irish and english west country . the christian bale character was well connected and the house he occupies with pocohantas in england is enormous . so it was n't clear why bale and rebecca wanted to return `` home '' to virginia and live in a shack in a swamp . also , why was pocahontas called rebecca ? there was little chemistry between any of the romantic leads so it was difficult to believe in the love stories . on the positive side , the cinematography was beautiful and the costumes looked realistic . james horner 's classical score was excellent . the movie seemed like the work of an amateur with a budget which seemed cobbled together in the editing room . judging from the other reviews i probably did n't get it .		3		0
'50 first dates ' competes for the title of the worst film of the year . the story is set in hawaii , and the hero is a local falling in love with a girl hit by a kind of amnesia that makes her forget overnight everything that happened before the car accident she went through . the idea of falling in love again each day has some potential , unfortunately the script goes all the time the easy way , combining bad taste and bore . the cinematography does not exceed in quality vacation commercials . the humor , if we can call it so is worse than in tv comedy series , reminding the 60s animals series for children . drew acts decently , but can not save this bad film alone . 3 out of 10 on my personal scale .		3		0
`` 100 feet '' is a horror/thriller hybrid that looks potentially interesting on paper due to the names involved . the film marks the comeback - after more than ten utterly silent years - of eric red ; the writer of genuine 80 's classics `` the hitcher '' and `` near dark '' and the writer/director of 90 's guilty pleasures `` body parts '' and `` bad moon '' . the lead role is for famke janssen , whom everybody -- especially the male viewers -- always adored but never had a chance to admire in a proper lead role . it 's also the type of film that initially comes across as satisfying and successful thanks to a fairly original plot -lrb- or a rather fresh variation on an old theme -rrb- and a handful of effective jump moments . unfortunately , however , it 's also the type of film that becomes a lot more lightweight when you contemplate and analyze a little bit further . the concept of a woman who ca n't escape the enraged ghost of her dead husband because she 's put under house arrest is indeed reasonably original , but it also feel very unfinished and shabby . usually ghosts are summoned or unleashed , whereas in this case we 're simply supposed to accept he remained present in the house and patiently waited more than 7 years for marnie to become released from prison ? and why was marnie ever convicted to such a harsh punishment in the first place , especially since there 's clear evidence that she filed numerous complaints against her ill-natured other half ? anyway , holes and illogical elements in the script i can easily overlook -lrb- ca n't be a horror fan otherwise -rrb- but there are far worse problems in `` 100 feet '' to struggle through . the film is , strangely enough , rather boring and does n't feature any really worthwhile until quite late in the film . luckily famke than makes the -lrb- rather unwise -rrb- decision to provocatively tease her dead husband whilst she 's having sex with a young stud in their marital bed . the dead guy , who got murdered for being hostile and jealous in the first place , finally snaps and does a couple of nauseating things . the main characters are bland and stereotypical , like the macho copper who never bothered to question his partner 's behavior or the teenage toy-boy desperately waiting to score with a milf , and the end-twist is pretty retarded . i hate to write such harsh comments on eric red 's comeback feature , but if this is the best he could do after ten years ; he should have waited some more years .		3		0
this movie gets an a for assembling a cast and putting out previews but seriously lacks in any real follow through . put this movie at the bottom of the heap and watch on a night when you ca n't seem to fall asleep because this is pretty close to a sleeping pill . the acting is ok but the a-list actors only comprise bits and pieces of the movie and are hardly able to turn this film into anything more than a snooze fest . frankly this is one of those movies that helen mirren did just to pay some bills and probably only took a few days of her time . i expected much better from the hype the trailers gave out , but then again most movies these days fall completely flat compared to their big budget advertising . my take away is if you want to see a nazi hunter film , subscribe to the national geographic channel and watch a documentary on the real thing . it would be more entertaining than a bland film over hyped by it 's studio .		3		0
i was torn about watching this movie . from what i had seen of the trailers it seemed to be a movie with a lot of potential , but two things were competing inside me : i have rarely seen a movie with jack nicholson that i did n't like , and i have rarely seen a movie with adam sandler that i did like . which pre-conceived notion would win out ? in this case , the sandler view proved the more powerful . i thought this was a pathetically weak movie , which basically matches my view of adam sandler 's acting talents . some people love him . fair enough . to each his own . i find him an extremely limited , one-dimensional actor . movie after movie , he plays basically the same pathetic loser who gets into a series of unbelievable situations and has to find a way to cope . how many times do we have to see essentially the same character and essentially the same story ? think about it . `` happy gilmore , '' `` mr. deeds , '' `` anger management . '' the list could go on . they 're all basically the same -lrb- and i did n't like any of them . -rrb- which leads to one of two conclusions : either sandler is hopelessly type-cast , or he really is n't capable of playing any other part . i tend to lean toward the latter , because i do n't even think he plays these parts particularly well . anyway , if you 're a sandler fan , go for it . you 'll like this , because it 's like everything else he 's ever done . if you 're not a sandler fan , avoid this like the plague because , well , it 's like everything else he 's ever done . i 'm giving it a 3 , just because i ca n't bear to rank a movie with jack nicholson any lower than that .		3		0
this film is about a woman 's life after becoming a bounty hunter . the scenes jumped around too often . there were too many scenes filmed with filters which made the scenes look too strange . i felt that , despite the film having so many scenes , it did not really tell me a story . there were also some subplots that were started but left unfinished . in addition , i did not really want to see dead animal bodies getting flushed down the toilet . or a man 's arm being blown to pieces . these scenes were too disgusting and unnecessarily violent . this film is too weird for my taste .		3		0
this film was a roller coaster ride for me . initially , i was told be practically everyone this film stunk . one person said it was `` artistic '' -lrb- and i now disagree -rrb- . the film started off slow and tedious , focusing on the main character 's language barrier . by halfway , i admit i was in love with this film . i was eager to see what would happen next -- the ways the character gets food and money are very interesting . but the honeymoon was short and by the end , i wished this film a spot in eternal damnation . the story , if you do n't know , is of a man who uses his citizenship in midair because his country plunges into civil war . not being able to go home , and not able to enter america on a passport , he ends up trapped and living in the jfk airport . the film stars tom hanks -lrb- who is given way more credit than he deserves -rrb- and catherine zeta-jones . also , there is an oompah that juggles and spins plates . sadly , this guy is the most interesting character in the film . my minor beef is the `` product placement '' that runs rampant in this film . burger king , borders , and a dozen other stores must have poured millions of dollars into this movie . my major beef is the `` far-fetched '' complaint . at first , it starts out believable . but soon , the airport security chief becomes a monster and a caricature of evil . hanks builds things -- walls and fountains -- in the airport without security caring , and rips chairs out of the ground . he befriends people and exchanges favors , falls in love with a gorgeous flight attendant -lrb- who annoyingly brings up obscure napoleon facts for no reason at all the wrong times -rrb- and in some scenes has what looks like a thousand employees working as his entourage . i do n't happen to believe this . a point for steven spielberg . while he usually pumps out mediocre crap , this film is different . it 's still mediocre crap . but it 's mediocre crap that does n't rely on aliens , jews or little boys to sell the story . thanks steven , i appreciate the fact tom hanks did n't have to fight off aliens in the terminal to save a jewish boy . -lrb- although in fairness all directors have their themes . -rrb- is this film recommended ? of course not . if you like tom hanks and steven spielberg , that 's your first mistake . do n't make renting this movie your second mistake .		3		0
` patch adams ' stars robin williams in the role as a doctor who uses humor to liven up the hopes of his patients . the story follows this character through some ups and downs in life and in his career as some people do not approve of his techniques . the film uses williams ' style of humor along with his sensitivity for his fellow humans . in the role , williams is good because it is a typical role for him . however , the film is too long and can not its message . better editing may have helped , but i think that a lot of it was down to the script -lrb- yes , i know it is based on a true story -rrb- . that said , if you enjoy films about people and/or work in the medical environment , you can probably relate to this , and it probably has a deeper sense of meaning . i just got bored of it quickly , and i always find robin williams to be a little annoying .		3		0
before i say anything else , everyone here is very likable , even those people who seem to have walked in from central casting as props or decoration . the main players are back , each competing with each other for time and attention , probably a bit more selfish , this time out . johnny depp plays or appears confused as to how much money he seems to be making in this `` sequel '' . there are some very impressive special effects , way too many of them this time out , and though i would like to enjoy each and everyone of them , i think i would probably not want to sit through this very lengthy and not very exciting film . first of all , the resolution of the cliffhanger is dealt with shabbily , as we see our friends on their way to jack 's rescue . unfortunately , along the way , with a get a bit of existentialism , double talk , and plenty of confusing story lines that become more and more tangled along the way , as those never ending conversations are interrupted over and over by some semi exciting special effects . once in a while , there is hint of what made the first film so enjoyable , as deep 's jack is back with a flash of his personality . fleshing out the other characters appear to have been problematic for the `` writers '' of this entry as they give each character a chance to explore part of their personalities we have never seen before . there is no subtlety here , no opportunity to show how good of an actor anyone can be . knightley suddenly changes into a `` leader '' , bloom shows his dark side , rush , well , continues to mystify us , and the other characters continue to be window dressing . moral of the story : more money means more revelations , more time , more noise , more of almost everything , except a good story . d -		3		0
-lrb- edit : i 'd like to remind people that this was written before ` pirates ' ! -rrb- johnny depp has acknowledged in the past that he is not ` blockbuster boy ' , and never wanted to be . `` nick of time '' is the closest he 's come in his career so far to entering that field -lrb- `` 21 jump street '' does n't count -rrb- the resulting movie suggests that he is entirely right in his assertion , and that his talents are better suited to more outlandish projects . there are many problems with `` nick of time '' , however , and the fact that johnny depp does n't suit the film is just one of them . truth be told , nobody looks entirely comfortable with their part , each performer generating the sense that they 'd really rather be somewhere else . frankly , i do n't blame them . walken appears to have utilised the escape clause of hamming up his part dreadfully , which may have been a slight amusement for him , but was downright painful for me . none of the characters are sketched anything more than very thinly , which i realise owes slightly to the dynamics of the central concept ; but then , if you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen , as they say ... -lrb- spoilers onward . -rrb- what might have been a gripping premise if we actually cared about any of the characters , is instead looked on as a godsend because it ensures a mercifully short running time . most of the details of the scenario presented herein are fantastically implausible , such as the ability of walken to materialise from nowhere just as depp finds a way to get help . the mini fight scene in the lift is hysterical , owing to walken 's panto villain demeanour , depp 's unease , and the fact that the director tries -lrb- and fails -rrb- to extract maximum tension from his claustrophobic surroundings by ` throwing ' the camera around as if it were on a string . good idea , potentially talented cast , horrendous execution .		3		0
well , if you liked hercules -lrb- starred as kevin sorbo -rrb- tv series you might like this one too , it has that same campy feeling in it . with the exception , that it has nothing own in it , all is borrowed from somewhere else . i 'm not saying that hercules was brain wood , but at least it had some good episodes in it ... i think , but it was so long ago when i saw the series . the main reason why this movie has been made was , that from some reason the rock became a big name outside the wrestling audience , and the biggest movie he had been was the mummy , where he played -lrb- or most of the time a crappy cgi effect played him -rrb- a villain named the scorpion king , so someone came up with an idea to make his birth as an action flick . as a movie tsk is in the same level with conan the destroyer -lrb- yes , that horrible sequel for conan the barbarian -rrb- : mostly annoying and sometimes funny , but from all the wrong reasons .		3		0
the a nightmare on elm street series is one of thee most uneven horror franchises out there -lrb- not the worst , however -rrb- and after the 3rd gets progressively worse -lrb- until new nightmare -rrb- . anoes 4 : the dream master -lrb- 1988 -rrb- was a clear drop in quality after the fantastic anoes 3 : dream warriors -lrb- 1987 -rrb- , but it was bearable . anoes : the dream child goes one step further and becomes almost unbearable but to be fair these sequels were stretching the story to unsalvageable lengths . but being the cash cow these horror sequels were in the day they dreamed -lrb- excuse the pun -rrb- up another way to resurrect freddy . this time freddy is literally reborn and begins picking off the springwood kids through alice 's -lrb- lisa wilcox , who returns from part 4 -rrb- unborn child . to stop freddy alice must seek help from amanda krueger , freddy 's mother . many consider this sequel the worst in the series , including robert englund . even stephen hopkins , the director this time around , stated this movie was a miscalculation . one of the most obvious issues this time around is the lack of deaths , three all up which is the lowest in the series . now , this is the part where the horror purists come out and say `` oh , if the story is good you do n't need blood and gore '' and so on , but let us be honest here , when watching a slasher film a good story is a bonus to the inventive kills , which this series is famous for . part 3 , and part 4 to a lesser extent , had high body counts with an interesting story . so here we are left with minimal deaths and a pretty average story . furthermore , by this sequel freddy had truly become the comedian , no longer scary in the slightest , although englund still gives it all he 's got . the only two positives in this installment are the excellent special effects and gothic settings . 1 1/2 / 5		3		0
look , i 'm just not going to spend too much time on this -lrb- mostly -rrb- piece of crap . naked gun 33 1/3 : the final insult suffers many defeats , probably the : the absence of the original zaz -lrb- jim abrahams , david & jerry zucker -rrb- creators who brought you the masterpiece airplane ! , the way above average the naked gun : from the files of police squad ! and the mostly funny top secret ! them , like the police chief in the first two naked gun 's knew well enough to distance themselves . sure , it defeats some comedy disasters : unbelievably , it gets better as the movie progresses . how much better ? well , start on the absolute cutting room floor and work your way up a few inches . so , there were a few , i 'll admit , funny segments in the 2nd half to finale , but most fell flat . such as `` where 's waldo '' -- really ?!? -- and an actual `` beavis and butt-head '' tribute ? gim me a break . i failed to mention to amount of homophobia in the previous two chapters . this one tops the other two threefold . yeah , i get one was mocking the crying game -- duh , but it 's still not a pleasant thing to see , when it 's this vicious and not simply funny . i 'll quickly skim the plot : jane -lrb- presley -rrb- and frank -lrb- nielsen -rrb- are fighting and leaving each other . . again . frank is also leaving police squad behind , as all movie cops have to retire somewhere in the story line . and some bad guy in jail -lrb- ward -rrb- plans a break out , with frank 's help in the slammer undercover and to avoid in the showers . ha ha ha ha ha ha and ha . no , i 'm really not laughing at prison `` dropping the soap '' jokes . literally -- they went there . anyways , the target is the academy awards for no other reason to blow up the place because this movie wo n't come close to winning any awards . now that it appears i 've completely bashed this movie , i will say there are a few funny moments : jane 's exit from frank -- really hilarious as were the fake movies and presentations at the oscars . there were a few tiny , tiny moments sprinkled , but not enough for a recommendation . seriously , this movie , despite some moderately funny moments , felt eerily spliced together and most as an afterthought . even the oscar fake movies , as humorous as they were , seemed rushed . this movie gets no endorsement from me , and thank goodness this would be the last -- mark my words : i guarantee neither leslie nielsen or george kennedy will anytime soon be appearing in a fourth movie , much less any feature length film . and you can forget about o.j. simpson -- who hilariously plays a dumb and distracted cop here -- once he 's released , he 'll undoubtedly do something else incriminating .		3		0
watching teen comedies is like supporting a losing sports team - you expect them to fail but always go along in the hope that they might occasionally score . chalk this one up as another defeat . at least harold and kumar are n't as obnoxious as you might think - they 're geeks with a cool streak and the guys playing them might even have a future , given a few original gags to roll with . but this stuff is all so tired and obvious that , four days after seeing it , i ca n't cite a single stand-out moment . it 's not the worst of its type but every scene has been done before , and better . wild raccoons in cars , hillbillies with bad skin , stoners dreaming of limitless weed ... surely someone can take us on a trip that goes somewhere different ?		3		0
`` casino royale '' 's final half-hour is about as boring as 007 has ever gotten ... except for the entirety of this thoroughly irritating 2.5-hour that reduces james bond to james bored . first of all , there 's nothing wrong with george lazenby as an actor ... but this role clearly was n't right for him . he turns 007 's most classic lines into a depressingly bad kind of amateur night . of course , he is n't nearly as bad as timothy dalton or pierce brosnan -lrb- yes , you read that correctly -rrb- , and he 's probably hampered by the utter transformation that takes place : of all the times bond has fallen `` in love '' -lrb- i.e. , solitaire , vesper lynd , etc. -rrb- , none was quite so irritating as the obnoxious tracy di vincenzo , played by a normally quite talented diana rigg . the film flip-flops between very poorly staged action sequences -lrb- at least 90 % of which take place in the swiss alps -rrb- and jim mooning over tracy to the tune of such songs as `` we have all the time in the world '' -- which does n't even sound right in louis armstrong 's voice . the plot -lrb- is an allergy clinic really just the tool of ernst blofeld ? -rrb- is better suited to a cheap knockoff than a film in the actual series . and the villain who comes closest to being even remotely chilling as an evil figure ... is named after a cake . connery was not the best bond -lrb- roger moore , come on down ! -rrb- , but he should n't have left the series so early . at least with him on board , it would n't have been as bad in an otherworldly sense ... it would still be deplorable , but at the end of the day , you could have said something for it other than `` oo ... pretty colors ...

this is the second film i 've seen this year based around catholic religion , the first being the action film priest , which was at least occasionally fun . the rite , on the other hand -lrb- and forgive the pun -rrb- , is a wrong . inspired by true events , the film follows a catholic priest in training named michael kovak -lrb- played by colin o'donoghue -rrb- , his underlying lack of faith , and his journey to rome to practice exorcism . he 's taken under the wing of an unorthodox welsh exorcist named father lucas -lrb- played by anthony hopkins -rrb- , but still remains a skeptic , even having seen demonic possession before his very eyes . the film is basic suspense film formula . -lrb- it ca n't really be deemed a horror -rrb- now , formula is not such a terrible thing as long as you can add some substance to it , but the rite is not only flavorless , it 's boring . anthony hopkins at least gains some chills thanks to his quietly frightening demeanor , and the pierce of his icy blue eyes , and though the film did make me jump a few times , there 's points where the scares are n't all that convincing , and even gets laughably bad on rare occasion . the rest of the cast are also monotonous , and the characters are not very well written . on top of that , the film is so bland that i really ca n't think of very much to say about it . * 1/2 out of ****		3		0
for starters , i 've been a big disney and animation fan all my life ; seeing pinocchio at a pretty early age and `` robin hood '' on its initial release made huge impacts on me , and by the time this film came out i 'd caught up with all of the disney features . i loved - and still love - the early work , and have mixed reactions to most of the stuff from `` peter pan '' through `` oliver and company '' with a few exceptions . `` the little mermaid '' seemed like a return to form - and a return to the fairy tales that the company always seemed to do best with , and i liked `` beauty and the beast '' even more . `` aladdin '' was alas a major step down - still pretty solid in the animation department , but robin williams ' shtick was for me completely out of place and irritating . it was of course their biggest hit to that point , and they took some of the lessons they 'd learned - less romance , more slapstick and gross humor , celebrity voices - and applied them to `` the lion king '' with even more spectacular results . for 15 years this film has ranked among my worst films of all time , and every time i mention that i get people reacting as if i told them i was the antichrist . seriously - i think more people will get bent out of shape if you tell them you hate `` the lion king '' than if your feelings are negative about `` citizen kane '' , `` casablanca '' , or `` 2001 '' . it 's always struck me as weird , because i know i 'm not the only person to dislike it , and in fact none of the friends i saw it with when it came out liked it much - though none of them hated it like i did either . i think that the main problem for me in 1994 is that the elements that i disliked from `` aladdin '' in particular seemed amped-up several degrees here . i hated whoopi and cheech , hated the music , hated above all what i saw at the time was an assault on intelligence and wit - the smartest and coolest character in the film , scar , also is pure evil , and all of the `` good '' characters are white-bread , boring , stupid . dumb and strong triumphs over smart and clever ; the songs sucked ; the animation was coarser and less interesting than in the previous couple of films . i suspect that there were a lot of personal issues that contributed to my overwhelming hatred of the film , too , but those are lost to me at the moment . i 'm pleased to say on this re-watch that i do n't hate the film anymore . but i still do n't like it . the issues with the treatment of scar - not sure what i was thinking there , that was over-the-top on my part . sure jeremy irons ' voicing of him is in many ways a typical smart but venal character , a godless intellectual i suppose - but it 's not really that overstated or deliberate , it does n't come off as anti-intellectual to me anymore . james earl jones ' mufasa may not be a genius , but he does n't come off as a dumb brute either , and nobody can really beat jones in that kind of role . the opening sequences are somewhat impressive , and the film is rarely boring . i actually sort of liked the shaman baboon character rafiki -lrb- robert guillaume -rrb- , and it 's good that young simba -lrb- jonathan taylor broderick -rrb- takes a fair amount of screen time to grow up . but ... i still hate the music ; `` can you feel the love tonight '' i actually found tolerable in relation to the other songs , but even it was so cloying and just banal that i had a hard time not fast-forwarding . this is purely a matter of taste , i make no bones about it - i like very little of elton john 's work and so it 's not surprising really . i still find the hyena characters irritating , unfunny , and way over-used . the female characters are essentially just there to move the action forward - no , the film ai n't obviously racist like i guess i thought it was -lrb- though it 's rather confusing in its racial and ethnic undertones -rrb- but it 's definitely a boys ' film . timon and pumbaa are gross and annoying and the film as a whole just has no sparkle , no wit to me . the animation does n't have the zip or the beauty of the previous few films ; the direction and pacing seem more inevitable than exciting , the `` spectacular '' scenes like the stampede that kills mufasa just do n't come off as all that spectacular as the digital help is too obvious and cheap-looking . in any case , it was n't torture to watch anymore , and it 's actually reawakened an interest in going back through the disney feature canon , re-watching some of the ones i do n't remember well and catching up with a few of the newer ones that i never bothered with after being disappointed by this and `` pocahontas '' in succession .		3		0
` stop ! or my mom will shoot ' represents two of the usual types of movies i enjoy watching : movies with some of the great action heroes , and movies likely to appear on imdb 's worst 100 list -lrb- to clarify , this in no way includes steven seagal 's ` out for a kill ' -rrb- . in this case , we have sylvester stallone , and a movie appearing at # 75 on the worst 100 list . yay ? sly plays sgt. joe , a cop who feels his mother is ruining his life . when his mother -lrb- estelle getty -rrb- arrives in town to visit , what do they do ? a normal family get together ? go out and and solve a major crime ? oh yes , most definitely the latter . i 'm surprised stallone 's career survived this . luckily for him , ` cliffhanger ' came out the next year , otherwise , this probably would have been the end . i 'll admit that i 'm being a little unfair . stallone was trying his hand at comedy , and i 'll commend for him trying . there are a few funny moments , but not enough to make me want to watch this more than once . sure , seeing estelle getty going is amusing , but even watching her wield a weapon gets old quickly . none of the action scenes are all that exciting either . ` stop ! or my mom will shoot ' is at best , a weak action / comedy , and definitely not for hard-core stallone fans . in the movie 's defence : it is slightly amusing , but not enough to make we want to watch it ever again , and probably does not deserve its place on the - 3/10		3		0
shattered -lrb- also known as butterfly on a wheel -rrb- is one of those films that starts out with a solid cast of highly respected actors to pull audiences in and then proceeds to squander talent in a script that should be still on the reject shelf . the film has all the markings and big budget of a major hollywood money maker , but there is a very valid reason why the theatrical run was brief and unheralded , sending the movie to television and to dvd post haste : it just is a very weak work . writer william morrissey had a thought , camouflaged behind the meaning of an obscure line from pope -lrb- ` butterfly on a wheel ' -rrb- that refers to the degree of torture one can take before breaking . the problem is that this tale of the consequences of infidelity has been done many , many times before with far better results . the astute viewer will find all the cracks in the plot line of this supposed ` startling thriller ' from the first few frames : watching suspicions play out is very anticlimactic . morrissey depends on what he imaged as a ` big surprise ' ending and it just does n't surprise ! gerard butler , maria bello , and pierce brosnan are all strong actors and one wonders why they opted to participate in this movie . it is not the best work of any of the three , trying to make credible characters out of the double-sided puzzle : kidnapping , testing of relationships , facing consequences of behavior . director mike barker lets the drama sag when it most needs to be pushed . unless the viewer just wants to see more of the three stars -lrb- even in a weak film -rrb- then that is the justification for sitting through this . otherwise , pass ... grady harp		3		0
when the chase family moves to an isolated house in the middle of nowhere in detroit , arkin -lrb- josh stewart -rrb- is hired to fix the windows and the doors . later he meets his daughter and his wife that has a debt with dangerous sharks and needs money , but his week payment is not enough to pay her debts . arkin plots to heist the safe of michael chase -lrb- michael reilly burke -rrb- during the night to raise the necessary money . however , when he arrives in the house , he finds that a sadistic criminal has imprisoned the family and planted traps everywhere . arkin seeks a way out of the deadly house to save his life . `` the collector '' is a stupid , gruesome and sick flick of a violent and sadistic sub-genre of horror that is becoming popular for some viewers . the story is flawed , incoherent and imbecile , and surprisingly this movie is overrated in imdb and with good reviews , some of them visibly fake by simpleton users with only one review in imdb . there many incoherent and ridiculous situations like , for example , how could the collector put all those gadgets and traps in the house in a couple of hours with the family at home ; or when arkin succeeds in leaving the house but returns to rescue hannah in an absurd attitude ; or why hannah decides to show up only when arkin is outside the house ; or how the police officer could be surprised by the dog having a gun in his hand ; or how could the invulnerable collector survive to the chandelier with knives and then attack the ambulance . i believe i could prepare a long list of foolish and idiotic attitudes . the cinematography is above average and the music score with bauhaus is very dark . my vote is three . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` o de '' -lrb- `` the collector of corpses '' -rrb-		3		0

final score : 3.8 -lrb- out of 10 -rrb- dragon movies are such a lifeless that to do anything to put a fresh spin on them would be an interesting and welcome change of pace . anything . at the ground level , ` reign of fire ' has got to be the most high-concept dragon movie in years . and it still manages to be a total bore . it 's almost as if they made an effort to keep out all the creativity and excitement that this movie could have been laced with . ` reign of fire ' -lrb- a title that almost sounds pretentious -rrb- picks up after dragons have emerged from deep in the earth and nearly exterminated the human race . that 's the first mistake of a movie that amounts to a plethora of missed opportunities . the movie glosses over what would have been much more interesting movie about the battle between mankind and a race of dragons in favor of following a band of survivors in a dreary post-apocalyptic future . it feels assembled off the cutting room floor from the scraps of a bigger , better movie . there are ideas here and there like when the movie gives us it 's explanation for how the dragons breathe fire . the best scene is one where skydivers jet toward the ground in an effort to capture a flying dragon in a net . it does n't make a lick of sense even in the rules set-up by the movie , but it is at least a lively action set-piece . the stars of the show are obviously the visual effects used to bring the dragons the life . i wonder how much matthew mcconaughey and christian bale got paid to wear long dreadlocks and lend their names to the credit above the title . the effects are remarkably detailed , but they also have a detached quality to them . they do n't have the feel of existing in real space . director rob bowman -lrb- ` the x-files ` movie -rrb- never gets us down and dirty in there with them . the dragons are almost always at a distance as if to make it obvious that our heroes are crawling around in front of a blue screen . bowman , himself , proves useless to the proceedings . even in life-and-death , save-the-world situations he fails to generate the slightest rise out of the audience . he approaches this movie with the same banal style that works on a like ` the x-files ' but does n't fly when the audience is expecting to see a big , blistering roller-coaster action movie .		3		0
four couples go to a tropical island in the hope of reconnecting with each other . this has it all . a little bit of survivor tv show , the bachelor tv show , big brother tv show , and the dr. phil tv show . and , this is billed as a comedy . give me a break . the promos did me in again . i will never learn . the first 10-minutes are good and we anticipated a good time when all the couples go to the island . then the tv shows mentioned above chimed in . the couples are set up in structured classes -lrb- that they did n't know about -rrb- and some are embarrassing to watch , especially what passes for yoga lessons . they are actually sexual exercises positions presented rather crudely , i thought . they only served to titillate the 7th and 8th graders who got in when no one was looking . we see jean reno in here . yes , he is the frenchman who is in all those hit-man and espionage movies . i was kind of hoping he did some of those things at this paradise . did n't happen . pity . he had a guru role for the couples . you could tell he was nervous as i saw his hands twitching like they missed holding a glock or sniper rifle . the only stand-out was peter serafinowicz as sctanley -lrb- pronounced stanley -rrb- as he played the mr. roarke role -lrb- from fantasy island tv show -rrb- with that deep commanding voice . good job . no good one-liners , no physical comedy to relate . vince vaughn had a hand in writing and producing this so you know where to look if you do n't have a good time . okay , it was mostly dr phil throughout as each couple was set up with a psycho analyst and that would have been okay , but nothing funny happened . if you watch an actual dr. phil show , you will hear some good one-liners from time to time . hey , i used to channel check . one would think the writer of this movie , whoever it was -lrb- v. vaughn -rrb- , would have taken the time to catch a few dr. phil shows . but the was bland , bland , bland . and , then things became too serious . not good for a `` comedy .

this almost without doubt is the worst film i have seen in a while . i struggled to watch it to its conclusion . no comedy for me , no laughs , just a bunch of affluent american couples who all have relationship difficulties -lrb- who does n't ? -rrb- and there are appointed holiday therapists to help the couples along through their difficulties , even though they did n't think they had any difficulties . the fitness instructor guy was absolute ace in my opinion and that was the best bit of the film , the rest of it you can truly scrap . live and let lived but not with this one . loosen up america , the rest of the world does not want your garbage and this is pure garbage and nobody in their right mind , warned in advance what they might see , will go and see this movie . so be warned !		3		0
among all of the many bad movies ever made , some are bad in a good way ; they might contain resonant ideas or images that long outlive the original context in which they were released and accepted . this is arguably one of those movies . plainly , nothing that occurs above the surface is of any interest -- this is painfully bad ` man in a rubber suit ' schlock -lrb- there 's one slight exception -rrb- . the debates with the over what to do with him . however , once underwater there are key visual bits . most famously is the view upwards towards a adams . she 's not allowed to be nude , but it 's suggested . this was blatantly stolen by spielberg for `` jaws '' . this seems to spend half of the running time underwater , and they successfully film the without a single air bubble escaping . once above water , he 's rather clumsy . he 's even burned and has to extinguish himself in the lagoon -- note that this was the template used for the immolation scene in scorcese 's `` cape fear '' . the creature attempts to kill all of his masculine ` rivals ' , so he can kidnap and possess the girl -- a narrative straight out of `` king kong '' . this sort of unrequited sexual attraction distinguishes the monster flicks from the slasher flicks -lrb- the `` psycho '' - styled bad guys are emasculated and have to plunge knives -rrb- .		3		0
the presence of stallone and kurt russell almost guarantee this is going to be at least watchable for most people . they have some modest chemistry between them and watching russell with a mane is always fun . most of us have seen it by now on tv or videotape so we know what it 's all about . cheesy buddy cop stuff about two hero cops who are framed by their drug-lord nemesis , with the twist that the two cops are thrown inside a prison filled by scum they have picked off the streets . but it 's got to be one of the most stupid , implausible , formulaic scenarios even for cheesy 80 's action . it 's all so mechanical and so filled with inane action that nothing sticks . it 's over before you know it and nothing is developed in the meantime . i 'd rather watch cobra again , where the cartoon fantasy of male aggression is at least complimented by a marvellous sense of place .		3		0
no woman during the 1950 's - even someone as unconventional as vianne - would volunteer that she has never been married and , hence , her child is illegitimate . indeed , reynaud would n't have gossiped to the villagers about her , but made sure vianne 's shop closed before it opened , and sent her packing . armande describing the shop 's décor as `` early mexican brothel '' is funny , but , since we can assume she has never been to mexico , such an observation would n't have popped into her head . hallström letting his non-french actors not sound french is n't nearly as bad as how he tries to shoehorn some reality into his fable , then , as if he 's afraid there 's too much realism , has reynaud get in line in a way that is completely out of character , and - in light of how he deals with the situation - cruel and undeserved . i find it a stretch that vianne and henri manage to keep it to themselves . and why did n't anyone hear him break in ? reynaud is not the baddie the movie needs to create tension , and , without tension , there is n't anything at stake . it 's only a matter of time before vianne wins everyone - and reynaud - over , and all is right with the world . by the way , the town 's name , lansquenet , is derived from the german `` '' -lrb- `` valet of the '' -rrb- , a term applied to a mercenary , which i found interesting as josephine 's dad was a nazi informer .		3		0
the title ` white noise ' refers to the phenomenon known as electronic voice phenomena -lrb- evp -rrb- . people believe that you can hear voices of the dead in the white noise of a radio and even see faces from the white noise on the television set . michael keaton stars in this thriller as jonathan rivers , a man who had just lost his wife in a freak accident . raymond price -lrb- ian mcneice -rrb- meets with jonathan and tells him that his wife anna has contacted him from the other side . jonathan does n't believe him until he hears anna 's voice on his radio . jonathan wants to talk to his wife , and he gets all the equipment . there is only one thing that jonathan does n't know , there are also bad people on the other side . you would think that talking to the dead would make this a scary movie , but this is n't . the movie is a little slow and boring . i can see why hollywood waited until january to bring out this movie . i have notice over the years that the month of january is when hollywood dumps their bad movies . you can save your money and skip this movie . -lrb- universal pictures , run time , rated pg-13 -rrb- -lrb- 3/10 -rrb-		3		0
i saw `` my bloody valentine '' when it played theatrically and i was bored . it 's up to scratch technically , but it 's just another slasher about a dead miner who shows up on valentine 's day to kill young lovers because they 're busy doing what he never got to do . that 's it . the film , prior to earning its `` r '' rating , was considerably gorier , and i 've read much rubbish about how great the thing would be if the gore was reinstated . i ca n't agree . if it was bloodier , it would still be a boring slasher ... but with bloody killings . there is no suspense , the characters are the usual clichés , and many scenes are so underlit we might be watching tar dry . i do n't like night scenes you ca n't even see because real night is n't like that . our eyes adjust to the darkness after a while and sometimes we use flashlights . a much better slasher than this is `` madman '' , a film with impressive night sequences we can actually see . the mine location is suitably creepy and probably had potential , but there 's no point crying over wasted scenery when quite clearly nobody was up to making much of this thin premise that was probably an easy sell to a studio -lrb- paramount -rrb- that was hot for special horror after `` friday the 13th '' poured millions into its coffers . the idea of `` my bloody valentine '' is much more interesting than the reality of slogging through its turgid scenery . try it yourself if you do n't believe me .		3		0
were it not for the outstanding performances of lakeview terrace 's stars , samuel l. jackson , patrick wilson , and kerry washington , i would have given this depressing film a vote of 2 stars out of 10 . the film is utterly devoid of humor and paints an oppressively sad picture of racism in the suburbs . this is n't the first depressing mess of a movie directed by neil labute , as the misogynistic , in the company of men , demonstrates . perhaps labute wanted to deliver a message on the wages of racial intolerance with lakeview terrace . if so , he failed . labute 's message was delivered with so much bitterness and anger , i found the movie nearly unwatchable . i suppose that it goes without saying that i do not recommend lakeview terrace .		4		0
shutter -lrb- 2004 -rrb- was not a great horror film but it was a competent one.it was entertaining and it had some creepy moments.but , now , we have another unnecessary hollywood -lrb- 2008 -rrb- is a as that.the '' scary '' moments produced accidental laughs on me.but , in spite of laughing a little bit , this movie enormously bored me.the special effects are pathetic.the actors show zero conviction on their masayuki ochiai made a mercenary work.the only positive thing i can find in this crap is that the ending from the original film was not is an unnecessary summary , this is another crappy must stop with this remakes .		4		0
i loved napolean dynamite but unfortunately nacho libre did n't add up . there are many ways in which nacho libre could have entertained . it could have involved some good action , and great wrestling students . it did n't . it could have had a romance plot with real chemistry . it did n't . the actor playing the nun was n't given much to do except respond , and played her character too straight . and without giving anything away i 'll just say the ending did n't resolve the final question . it could have been a good parody , but the film did n't seem to have anything intelligent to say about society or religion or even wrestling . also a good parody still needs to have a believable plot line to capture the interest of the viewers . the characterization was too thin for this in nacho libre . for example , when two characters fight but then decide to work together , it falls flat . it could have been funny . unfortunately , the comedy was mainly physical humor and fart jokes . there were a few laughs but they were sparse . from there it got worse . there was something wrong with the cinematography . the scene changes and edits were sometimes jarring . the emotional tone from one scene to another often did n't fit . it 's like the actors would cry in one scene and be happy in the next -lrb- but more subtle -rrb- . possibly the film was heavily edited . the acting was fairly poor , unfortunately , i 'm sad to say jack black himself , since i have enjoyed him in other films . there are three times when his character has to notice something out of the corner of his eye and it popped me out of the suspension of disbelief every time .		4		0
following on from save the last dance and a few other dance movies before , this recognisable title was the next one i tried , from choreographer turned director anne fletcher -lrb- 27 dresses , the proposal -rrb- . basically tyler gage -lrb- she 's the man 's channing tatum -rrb- lives with his foster parents in the lower class african american neighbourhood of baltimore , he is is a talented street dancer but also a troublemaker with his friends mac carter -lrb- damaine radcliff -rrb- and his little brother skinny carter -lrb- de ` shawn washington -rrb- . having fun partying and stealing cars , they one night break into maryland school of arts committing vandalism on the stage with all the props and equipment , and tyler is the one caught and sentenced to 200 hours community service . under the watch of director gordon -lrb- rachel griffiths -rrb- he is assigned to work as a janitor in the school cleaning floors and windows , and picking up the litter . he has been lightly distracted in his work seeing the dance classes , and particularly the talent of beautiful ballet student nora clark -lrb- take the lead 's jenna dewan -rrb- , who is already seeing someone . she oversees him doing his street dancing outside , and when her original partner andrew -lrb- tim -rrb- has a strain , tyler offers to take his place and follow her choreography . as the practising continues tyler not only suggests new street dance style moves into the routine that will be judged , but he and nora are getting very close . tyler has been known to start things and give up after just a short time , and of course this is what happens when for almost no reason at all he stops practising with nora , leaving her alone . she does try and get him back , and there is a small vice versa situation , it is after the boyz n the hood style shooting and death of skinny carter that tyler has to decide to help nora with her judged performance and maybe get a place in the dance school himself . in the end the final performance with tyler and nora goes brilliantly , they both gain high praise and interest from the judges and school heads , and obviously they are happy together . also starring singer mario as miles darby , drew sidora as lucy avila , heavy d as omar and josh henderson as brett dolan . tatum and dewan make a good couple , but to be honest the only highlight are all the well choreographed street dance sequences , not a bad romantic dance drama . okay !		4		0
1st watched -- 4 out of 10 -lrb- nichols -rrb- : dreary fish-out-of-water story attempt from director mike nichols and star harrison ford just does n't cut it on an emotional level despite the possibilities . the movie is about a hardline attorney who gets shot after a brief introduction to the character and loses a lot of his brain function including his memory and tries to climb back into his old identity . harrison ford is fine in the starring role and the other actors are ok too , but the direction just is n't that great . very little is done with music and the camera is just kind of there following the story except for a and pan-out at the beginning and end of the movie . nichols is an acclaimed director but he just does n't seem to do much with this story and the introduction of the characters before the accident is n't sufficient . henry , the main character , eventually decides to make a new life of himself with the help of his rehabilitation coach -lrb- who provides the best character in the movie -rrb- but then the movie is over pretty much . he develops a nice relationship with his daughter who has to help him do simple things like read and tie his shoes after the accident . he also develops a family life which he did n't have before because he was an obsessed . there are some good lessons here , but everything is really flat emotionally -- which does n't make for a worthwhile movie experience unfortunately .		4		0
dr. abigail tyler , a psychiatrist , keeps coming across patients who see owls in their window at night , but the owls are not what they seem . from there , it turns into a strange story of alien abductions , hallucinated murder and people who speak sumerian , a very dead language . i had low expectations of this film , and as such i ca n't really say i was let down . i mean , it was n't good , but already knowing that made it an easier pill to swallow . some parts were interesting , entertaining and well acted . i 'm always happy to see milla jovovich , and elias koteas becomes a better actor as he ages , despite looking like my uncle ted . i knew going in that the movie was fake . if i had not known that and if i believed in alien abduction , this film might have been somewhat convincing . although it 's cheesy that all the evidence was pretty much destroyed or distorted , the `` real '' footage was faked very well , and i sort of like the concept that the aliens were gods in a sense ... though , what gods would need to abduct people for is a great mystery . they have the technology to fly millions of light years away and remain undetected , but yet can not learn english -lrb- or anything newer than sumerian -rrb- and must experiment on primitive beings . the residents of nome who see this are going to be like , `` what ? '' being in wisconsin , i have a limited knowledge of alaska . but let me say this : there are not as many trees or cliffs in nome as this movie shows . there is no sheriff 's department . police are not allowed to have beards -lrb- though mustaches are okay -rrb- . and with s population of 3500 , it seems odd that it would have so many cops on duty ... but hey , you never know . i do not recommend you see this film . it may be entertaining for those who enjoy `` ghost hunters '' on tv and similar experiments in perpetuating cryptic bunkum . but the film itself is not really all that great and even among alien films , or alien abduction films , you may as well see `` fire in the sky '' or `` close encounters of the third kind '' , because this one fails to match those classics .		4		0
despite reading some dreadful reviews , i decided to take in bee movie since i love both animation and jerry seinfeld . while the former was mostly impressive , the latter as both leading player and head writer left a lot to be desired . the one worker bee who ventures in the outside world , makes friends with a human from there -lrb- renee zellweger -rrb- , and sues for a million have been executed perfectly but with jerry and his former `` seinfeld '' writing staff being the contributors , all we got was a mishmash of jokes that suited whatever they felt was funny and some punchlines of famous celebrities who conveniently seemed available -lrb- ray liotta , sting , and larry king -rrb- . nice to also hear voices of matthew broderick , chris rock , oprah winfrey , and former `` seinfeld '' co-star patrick warburton . but this is a very uneven movie that neither succeeds as adult parody or children 's classic . bee movie is worth a look at least once and that 's it .		4		0
brooding tale of a professor from england teaching in los angeles who is mourning the death of his partner in a car accident . everyone is telling colin firth that he does n't look well and that he should watch himself . the film centers on one weekend after class . for someone contemplating suicide , firth alternates via flashbacks with his male lover and meeting a south american hunk at a parking lot . on friday afternoon , he lectures his class on aldous huxley and fear . i was ready for a franklin roosevelt lecture on having nothing to fear but fear itself . in her brief appearance on screen , julianne moore is effective as a lady friend of firth 's . with an authentic british accent , she laments the fact that her husband has left her . the problem with brooding films is that they lack depth and to be perfectly honest , they become quite boring . how many college professors have a student over for drinks and a swim ? for sure , for firth and this film , this was certainly a weekend of reawakening and yet in the end , it was a lost weekend .		4		0

john rivers ' life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car . during the days she has been missing , he confronts a man that 's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other-side through e.v.p - electronic voice phenomenon . naturally he does n't believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e.v.p. soon enough john is hooked onto it , but something supernatural does n't like him interfering with the dead , as now other then contacting his wife , the white noise is foretelling events before they happen . since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now , i thought i better get around to watching it since it was n't my copy . but then again i do n't think the owners were in a hurry to get it back , as they have n't question me about it . oh well . so i decided to give it a play , as i was in an undemanding mood . after hearing and reading all the bad press on it , i was n't expecting anything remotely good , but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes . well , more so the 60 minutes , as the last half-an-hour was pretty much a blur of confusion . the film is nowhere as good as it could have been , but the time breezed by quick enough even though it 's a rather tepid supernatural thriller . i thought it was n't all a waste . the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there 's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you , but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film . that 's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just does n't fit in with the context . it becomes rather hectic , loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera-work that gets to close into the action . i could n't understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax . the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey . it 's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big , but hits rock bottom . i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera-work . other then the distinctively stark lighting , the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy . all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware , which makes it come across as very sterile and empty . you can easily see that the film 's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story . there 's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material . after a while , it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood-curdling stuff from beyond the grave . it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while . the e.v.p machine was the star on the show . well , it did have more impact than the limp performances . michael keaton is more than capable actor , but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers . he really deserves much better , though . everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable . not because of the performances , but of the lack of depth in their characters . this clunker was n't bad to begin with , but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically . i would n't care to see it again and i would n't recommend to anyone , unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror/thrillers . it 's just a damn shame that this over-produced flick could n't put it together successfully , as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand . i did n't hate it , but what a disappointment .		4		0
a salvage crew come across an abandon russian navy ship in an eye of a storm . thinking that they could be rich by this discovery that 's if there 's nobody on board , but there 's something strange happening on this ship . they come across a lone survivor who informs them that there 's an alien life form on the ship and it feeds on electricity . sure they do n't believe the person at first but when they come across machinery that has human parts attached to it they find out that the alien sees humans as some type of virus that should be wiped out . i 've always been curious about this little b-grade flick and when it popped on telly last night i did n't hesitate to tune in . to begin with it looked like i was going to thoroughly enjoy myself , keeping in mind that sure i was n't expecting anything grand , though i was hopping for some mindless , entertaining fodder . simple as that . actually it did deliver that in the first hour but shortly the impact started to wore thin by virtually losing itself in its many ideas . i was n't looking for anything original in it , but heck as i sat there blankly i could n't keep my mind off trying to think off the films it basically ripped off . like many users have mentioned it steals its thunder from the likes of ` alien ' , ` predator ' and ` the terminator ' . but no way does it reach the thrills and cleverness of those mentioned . although while they came to my head straight away , the designs of the robots mixed with human body parts totally baffled me , that 's until finally towards the end when borgs from ` star trek : first contact ' popped into my mind , and i see i 'm not the only one to notice amongst other comments by users on this flick . ` virus ' is shamelessly cheesy nonsense , beyond belief , but at the same time highly forgettable . that could be said because it plays out like a roller coaster , but without the screams and surprises , which you would like . remarkably not its predictable hokum and spreads out the clichés rather nicely , which you rather expect . with your obvious characters , people venturing off to scramble around unknown and poorly lit places on the ship and the usual heroics . the dead weight script is your basic dribble , which is plain bad and laced with shallow remarks for humour that you wonder how can they spit this trite out . what takes the cake is that script takes itself far too seriously and therefore the acting is rather waterlogged . god only knows why jamie lee curtis and donald sutherland penned their names to this clunker . everyone is unconvincing in their parts and just seems to float by with little effort or purpose . what was the deal with sutherland 's dreadful accent ? i do n't want to flatter the film too much , but there 's no denying it that is held top production values , which made sure it was well made and looked rather decent . the effects and designs looked okay and there are some nifty gadgets and toys on show . there 's even a tad of gore , not that much but decent enough . it 's just a shame it did n't last for too long . sometimes it was just too dark to see what was happening and that also contributed by the frenetic camera-work . where my experience really took a turn for the worst is when it limped and mopped about before it came to its drawn out climax . phew , close one as the ending i thought oh no not a open ending for a sequel , but the outcome is a take off another recent sci-fi flick . routine monster on the loose sci-fi farce that looks fair enough and provides some moments to keep you oddly amused .		4		0
when i think back , the war in italy has long been treated as a bit of a joke . no disrespect to the memory of those who suffered and perished during this dark period . -lrb- my own father travelled as a tommy from south to north through the country towards the end of the war . it 's a lasting regret that i did n't take the opportunity to question him on this and a million other subjects . no doubt he would have had his own slant to contribute . -rrb- but we are left with the likes of eric newby 's verbal portrait of himself diligently moving rocks from one part of the to another . or roberto benigni clowning his way around anti-semitism . now in tea with mussolini we find the horror of war being depicted as the lack of privacy for a group of matronly ex-pat englishwomen . jolly fine acting and all that , but not really my cup of duce . ron		4		0
i will say right now , i love airplane ! it is a hilarious movie , endlessly quotable and entertaining and if there is a role and performance the late leslie nielson should be remembered by it is airplane ! airplane ii : the sequel has its moments , but at the end of the day i felt rather lukewarm to it . i did like how it was made and the soundtrack , and there are some funny moments such as et phoning home and getting in trouble with the operator and the one with the elevator . although i did appreciate most of the cast returning , few of the cast maintain the energy and fun that was there in airplane and leslie nielson , part of the reason why airplane ! worked so well , is sorely missed ! william shatner comes off best . ken finkleman writes much better than he did with that abomination grease 2 , but it comes to the direction and writing sadly neither are particularly good . the writing and a vast majority of the jokes have a certain over-familiarity to them , while the direction comes across as uneven . i did n't mind that the story in concept was more of the same , some sequels that follow that formula work , but this was a case where it did n't because the story is carried out in a predictable fashion and the film never feels secure in its pacing either . all in all , whereas airplane ! was a classic , the sequel was for me a shrug of a film . 4/10 bethany cox		4		0
carrie getting your period is a magical time in a girl 's life because it means she can be excused from gym class once a month . however , the menstruating student in this horror movie would prefer a permanent absence . tormented by her peers -lrb- portia doubleday , gabriella wilde -rrb- after getting her first period , carrie -lrb- chloe moretz -rrb- later discovers the crimson curse also unleashed her latent powers of telekinesis . despite her mother 's -lrb- julianne moore -rrb- misgivings , carrie attends the prom with a boyfriend -lrb- ansel elgort -rrb- of one of her bullies . when her mother 's warning turns out to be true , carrie uses her twisted mind to massacre the student body . despite sanguinary scenes at the end and contemporary special effects , this adaptation of the stephen king novel is sluggish and superfluous when compared to the 1976 version . thankfully , the only power women derive from menstruation is the ability to continue advancing their career unimpeded by children . red light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca		4		0
i have n't extensively researched the genesis of hostel , but after watching it , i can imagine the sole idea that sparked the entire film : `` what if there was a brothel that charged patrons for the opportunity to torture and murder people instead of having sex with them ? '' very sick stuff , this , and an intriguing idea to boot . problem is , you have to build a film around an idea to bring it to life . while hostel has its concept in place , the movie that eli roth constructs around this premise is an incoherent mess . there are so many things wrong with this inexplicably popular gorefest , it 's hard to know where to begin . let 's start with our cast of obnoxious frat-boy meat-heads , whose exploits we 're supposed to vicariously enjoy , but who are so utterly unlikeable , we 're left hoping that they die within the first five minutes . we should also mention the seemingly inhuman ability these characters have to lose eyeballs and fingers throughout the course of the film , but somehow not lose enough blood to induce shock , or even mild discomfort . i 'm not sure if there 's a message intended in this film , but the moral i got out of hostel is that people who live in small european countries are completely insane . they 'd pretty much have to be to necessitate an entire industrial complex where a dozen rooms are filled with paying customers inflicting unfathomable tortures upon anonymous flailing victims . while this concept is certainly frightening , i 'm a bit more disturbed to find out that in some european locales , bands of children roam the streets committing acts of murder in exchange for bubble gum . this is not a joke , by the way , but actually a crucial factor in the climax of this wretched offering . but you probably are n't watching hostel to see any intelligence on display are you ? you 're really more interested in seeing grisly fates handed out to these bland , interchangeable characters for no apparent reason , right ? well , you certainly get that here , and if your weapon of choice is the unrated dvd release , you 're going to get plenty of it . problem is , you have to wait about an hour and sit through roughly 14 soft-core sex scenes to get there . should you decide to weather the endless barrage of gratuitous nudity -lrb- okay , not so bad ... i 'll give you that -rrb- and heavy drinking , you will find out fascinating things about the human body . for instance , did you know that when you cut someone 's eyeball out , egg yolk drips down their face ? i do now . thanks , hostel ! i really do n't want to waste too much time talking about a movie that i already squandered 90 dreadful minutes on , so i 'm not going to spend many more words discussing this . but i want to at least address the biggest problem with this film before i finish this review and sell back the useless dvd i just finished dirtying my player with . though the film eventually turns into an over-the-top grand guignol feast of sanguinary delights , the journey there is so long-winded and barren of suspense , most viewers without a penchant for self-loathing will turn this film off before the horror part of our program even gets underway . while there are certainly ample breasts on display during this hour-long road to nowhere , if this is enough for you to justify sitting through the antics of characters whose ability to annoy outshines even the most bravura splatter on display in this film , i really think you should leave your house more often . the light-hearted tone and `` look at us talking like normal teenagers '' dialogue do n't mesh with the brutality that follows , and this juxtaposition does n't make the torture scenes in this film more scary or powerful , it just confuses what the point of this whole mindless offering really is . i offer this film a 4 simply because the core concept is a very intriguing one , even if the execution of this concept is so inept that it renders the original idea impotent . a 5 might be a bit more fair , but i had to chop off a point because this film actually features a hunchback wearing medieval chain-mail . if there 's any resolution we get out of hostel , it 's that torture is never pretty . well , the agonizing process of sitting through this very stupid film is a lot more painful than anything the characters in the movie go through , so exactly why anyone would praise this senseless and artless piece of crap is beyond me . maybe someone gave them some bubble gum ?		4		0
yes , i will admit this movie had somewhat of a guilty pleasure , like watching the injured in an accident . i do not see anything , remotely , compassionate about a film that celebrates mental illness . oh i got the movie and the ` crutch ' that lars brought to him , from having a traumatic childhood . the fact is though , that a whole town accepting a rubber woman as real , was about as unrealistic as impregnating this sex toy . this movie pretended to be artsy . ok there was nothing that portrayed intimacy . if you want to call that a victory for tastefulness , ok . i wont though . i felt this was a sick , twisted perverted movie about someone that needed professional help . i am not talking about the ultra liberal doctor or church or friends and family . lars was a gentleman with a serious problem . this film made light of this problem and basically the film consisted of people condescending to lars . i , for one , did not see this is kind , as the movie , wanted you to see this . i saw it as cruel and mocking , in other words , the complete opposite . the positive of this film was it was not a borefest and the acting was superb . other than that , its just a sad commentary on human behavior to treat a mentally ill person as if he had normal social skills and standing .		4		0
ok , let 's get this over with . i did n't like manderlay to not even a close degree as i liked dogville . first and foremost , i just do n't think bryce dallas howard is any good in this . oh sure , she 's playing the character grace as her interpretation , but there 's just something , and i do think it 's physical , that she lacks . -lrb- she actually looks elfish in this role -rrb- . i 'm not saying that kidman is the only actress that could play this role . . let 's see , emily watson , reese witherspoon , heck even sharon stone -lrb- ok , maybe i 'm pushing it a bit there -rrb- could have done it . on the same note , why they would choose willem dafoe , normally a fine actor , do n't get me wrong , to replace james caan is beyond me . the story , about a southern plantation which is full of freed slaves not too sure of what to do now that the patriarch -lrb- who is played by lauren bacall , which actually is the one brilliant in-joke of the movie -lrb- or the second , as udo kier and jean-marc barr return as mafioso thugs from dogville -rrb- . this story is tries to get down to the bottom of racism in america , but just becomes a bit of a silly preaching statement with a somewhat ridiculous revelation in the end . i sure hope this series redeems itself with ` wasington ' . hey lars ! here 's an idea ! get lauren bacall to play grace this time out ! would n't that be interesting !?		4		0
leelee sobieski is a young actress of considerable grace and charm . her screen presence provides the most rewarding aspect of this tepid thriller . the plot : her parents are killed in a car crash , so she and her little brother move in with another couple . they seem like the nicest people in the world , but as time goes on it 's clear that something fishy is going on . is her guardian responsible for her parents ' death ? of course , this material has the potential to be a good dramatic thriller , but chills are few and far in-between . while mildly interesting at times , much of the film is a bore , with sobieski being the only positive element at times . the ending is just plain stupid , utilizing an ancient horror movie cliche that wore out its welcome a decade ago . it 's slick-looking but that does n't hide the fact that it 's just an exercise . * 1/2 -lrb- out of **** -rrb- released by columbia pictures		4		0
woody allen movies seem to always be either a hit or a miss . this particular film did n't even rise to the miss category . it was predictable and dull . there were a few funny lines , which all happened to be woody 's , but even those were few and far between . woody 's last effort , midnight in paris , was a delight , pure perfection . this one , however , is so forgettable as to be not worth bothering with . i will say i enjoyed alec baldwin 's part , but that was n't nearly enough to carry the movie . it was clear how allen wanted to have the mix all come together and easy to see what he was striving for with each episode ... . but none of it really worked . over-acted and under-written . i would say skip this one and wait for woody 's next film . odds are it will be a hit ... . or at least something better than this one .		4		0

in an ancient time , predating the pyramids , king memnon is using the psychic powers of his sorceress cassandra to for tell his great victories . in a last ditch effort to stop memnon from taking over the world , the leaders of the remaining free tribes hire the assassin mathayus to kill the sorceress . but mathayus ends up getting much more than he bargained for . now with the help of the trickster arpid , tribal leader balthazar and an unexpected ally , it 's up to mathayus to fulfill his destiny and become the great scorpion king ... a silly spin off of an even sillier movie , the scorpian king is by the numbers conan piffle , but it does show that dwayne johnson had very good screen presence , even though the script is dire . russell is a good director , and knows how to handle a high concept movie , but here he loses the plot ... and then some . so what we are left with is johnson and the great film writer grant heslov walking around the desert , bickering , having fights , bickering some more , and chasing after the cut price sean pertwee . there is n't any urgency in the movie , the set pieces are lethargic , and kelly hu 's hair is always in the wrong place . it 's the fast and the furious of sword and sandals movies , and it just plods on and on , until the predictable finale . if your a fan of johnson , forget this , and start with the rundown , at least it 's fun .		4		0
the idea of this movie is pretty creative , but besides that there really is n't anything positive about this movie besides edward norton being in it . he is a great actor and enjoyed some of the films he was in , in fact he is one of my favorite actor . in fact the main reason why i decided to watch this movie is because of edward norton , and already knowing about the plot revolving around the rivalry between ed and robin williams made me want to watch it even more . but for the most part was let down , it just went too much in the narrow and predictable direction . the start of the movie began pretty well though , but besides that i found the plot to be pretty dull . it was n't even smart , clever or witty in anyway , although i wished it could have been , mostly it 's a wasted potential of a movie . it did have a good message though and it did have it 's moments although very few . overall it really is n't a good black comedy and hardly has any funny parts in it . on a main positive note , the casting was brilliant but that is about it , there is little to no elements that grabs the attention . 4.8 / 10		4		0
i consider the british film school for scoundrels or how to win without actually cheating ! -lrb- 1960 -rrb- as one of the best comedies i have ever seen.the film is not only extremely funny ... it also has a great level of sophistication behind the , the remake is not funny -lrb- i think i only laughed a little in one scene -rrb- and when a comedy is not funny , there 's a serious for scoundrels -lrb- 2006 -rrb- is like a person who tells a joke without sense of humor.the film shows very used jokes without any sense of humor and the experience finishes being a boring comedy without sense of heder is an excellent actor -lrb- if you have any doubts he 's an excellent actor , watch napoleon dynamite -rrb- but he 's totally wasted here.the same happens with the great billy bob are excellent actors wasted in a bad for scoundrels is a bad remake of a masterpiece.i totally recommend the original film ... it 's may difficult to get it but the experience is totally funny and sophisticated .		4		0
i admit that the first film is n't great , apart from of course all the harrowing imagery and stuff , and i was certainly up for seeing this -lrb- as far as i know straight to dvd -rrb- sequel -rrb- . basically the film opens with paul -lrb- rider strong , from the previous film -rrb- looking all hideous and falling apart hit by a bus , and his virus filled fluids have managed to go into the creek that goes into a brand of bottled water . this bottled water ends up in the cold storage of a high school , as you see in the animated sequence , just waiting for many innocent teachers , students and visitors to drink it and catch the deadly virus . the story sees john -lrb- noah segan -rrb- deciding whether or not to go to the prom where his long time crush cassie -lrb- alexi wasser -rrb- is going to be , but he is afraid that her boyfriend marc -lrb- marc senter -rrb- will beat him . john 's friend alex -lrb- rusty kelley -rrb- was n't keen on going either , that is until he got a blow job and a yes that liz -lrb- regan deal -rrb- will be going . while john and cassie are clean , alex is slowly succumbing to the virus-infected water affects , as are many other people going to the prom . deputy winston -lrb- giuseppe andrews , from the previous film -rrb- realises the water thing happening , and goes to warn the company not to make any more deliveries , and this forces some people to take action . so the prom is on , john and cassie are having some fun , and they express their feelings for each other , only to be locked in the school with everyone else who is infected . with no escape they are trying to find a way out with the soon to die alex , and watch in horror as all the infected people disintegrate , and before dying , alex finds out there is no cure . in the end , john lets cassie get away while he i guess dies , and she is picked up by winston and herman -lrb- mark borchardt -rrb- to get some help -lrb- she might be infected -rrb- . oh , but hang on , you also see what happened to alex 's date liz , doing her thing as a stripper and disintegrating whilst performing , and you see another animated sequence showing the virus going into other things as well , e.g. office sweets -lrb- gives way to another sequel -rrb- . also starring alexander isaiah thomas as dane , michael bowen as principal sinclair , amanda as frederica and angela as ms. hawker . i would have to say , even though it is trying to hard to be a bit bigger with death count and blood amount , this sequel is certainly much more visceral than the smaller location original , so i 'd say it 's worth a go . okay !		4		0
this is n't that great of a movie . it 's best known as the first of the sergio leone westerns . it is no doubt the worst of his films . it 's pretty clear it had a very low budget . worth watching just because it 's interesting to see both leone and eastwood develop their styles progressively through the `` dollar '' trilogy . here 's what i liked : - atmospheric music and high operatic style is of course the main positive quality of all leone westerns . - eastwood is very good as the `` man with no name '' . - interesting scene where bandits dressed as american soldiers flip up the canvas on a covered wagon to reveal a machine gun , then surprise ambush a bunch of guys . eastwood reused this idea in the beginning of `` the outlaw josey wales '' . here 's what i did n't like : - plot was very disjointed and confusing with all the back and forth between the two families . - too much gratuitous graphic violence . - supporting acting was terrible . - very few locations shots outside of the cheap town set .		4		0
this is a very logical sequel to one of the greatest genre efforts ever and therefore almost impossible to reach the same . damien -- the son of the devil -- is an adolescent now and lives with his aunt -lrb- lee grant -rrb- and uncle -lrb- william holden -rrb- . he pretty much acts like any other teenager and is rather irritating in other words . yet , every time someone becomes suspicious towards him and/or his past , this person brutally comes to an end . these ingenious and horribly showed massacres are the only highlights in an overall lame film . don taylor desperately tries to maintain the breath-taking biblical tone of the first and adds multiple christian topics as well as an equally great musical score . holden is a worthy follow-up for gregory peck but he deserved a better script to work with , for sure . there 's a giant lack of tension and involvement in this sequel ! the character of damien as the antichrist was much more scarier at the age of 5 than he is at 14 ... still , as mentioned earlier , there are a couple of great death-scenes like who 's getting sliced up in an elevator and a chilling . for the fans of religion-themed horror especially !		4		0
i was n't too impressed by the first two parts , but hell , once you 've seen two you might as well make it three . not that i would 've missed anything if i skipped this one ... movie starts out as a western , and this sure is the best part . classy , stylish shots in the desert , and it even has something of a story . but once they come near to that famous bar , you know it 's gon na be just like the first two movies ... rebecca gayheart is gorgeous and michael parks is great as writer ambrose bierce , but thats about it . only watch if you 're a big fan of the series , 4/10 .		4		0
in fact , this film heads southward after an impressive start . there are inconsistencies here such as arthur kennedy killing a man for doing what he does later on . aline macmahon attempts to portray a feisty woman , but let 's face it , aline , who attended my alma mater , erasmus hall high school , in brooklyn is anything but the feisty type . you need someone of the caliber of marjorie main in the role . as for donald crisp in the role of the patriarch , he is not exactly mr. morgan , the prize role that got him an oscar 14 years before in the memorable `` how green was my valley . '' william wyler 's sister-in-law , the always frail looking kathy o'donnell , is far too dainty in her part as the young lass who came out west with her father and instead found herself amidst quite a family . o'donnell , who never looked better in a film , acts as if she came out of a finishing school . the part was beneath her , for she gave outstanding performances as wilma , harold russell 's self-sacrificing girlfriend in `` the best years of our lives , '' and , the leprosy victim , sister of charlton heston , in `` ben-hur . '' james stewart in the lead of the film again comes off as the `` aw-shucks '' guy . arthur kennedy , as always , steals the film in a complex role of a dedicated foreman to crisp resorting to violence when things do n't go his way .		4		0
the first film was a fantastically fun film that made the leading actor a huge star , famous especially for his motormouth style , and so naturally the makers wanted to cash in with the success with a sequel not long later , from director tony scott -lrb- top gun , true romance , enemy of the state -rrb- . basically detroit cop det. axel foley -lrb- eddie murphy -rrb- watches the news broadcast from beverly hills and is shocked to see that his friend capt. andrew bogomil -lrb- ronny cox -rrb- was shot by a tall woman , and he rushes to go and see him in hospital . he is reunited with cop partners det. william ` billy ' rosewood -lrb- judge reinhold -rrb- and det. sgt. john taggart -lrb- john ashton -rrb- who may at times want to stick to the rules of the law , and who police chief harold lutz -lrb- allen garfield -rrb- is trying to fire , but they are also very keen to find the person who tried to kill bogomil . going on as they investigate the attempted murder are a series of specific robberies , being called the alphabet robberies , as the perpetrator leaves behind clues , an alphabet letter , in chronological order . the robberies seem to be masterminded by weapons kingpin maxwell dent -lrb- jürgen prochnow -rrb- , and axel and his two chums have a key suspect for who tried to kill bogomil , especially in the criminal 's tall blonde girlfriend , and gun expert , karla fry -lrb- brigitte nielsen -rrb- . axel follows all the clues that are leading to both the robberies and the murder attempt , using all forms of manipulation and conning to get past those that get in his way , and his motormouth antics do come in handy in the situations he gets into , and of course in the end the case is solved . also starring dean stockwell as charles ` chip ' cain , paul reiser as det. jeffrey friedman , gilbert r. hill as insp. douglas todd , paul guilfoyle as nikos and robert ridgely as mayor ted egan . murphy does still create some good giggles with his fast trash talking behaviour to get his own way , and supporting cast members reinhold and ashton again are great characters to join in the fun , the only cast member you can complain about is nielsen putting on another silly foreign villain accent . there were some alright chase sequences , and one or two reasonable psychical and dialogue based jokes , it is n't as good as the first film of course , it is a not too terrible action comedy sequel . it was nominated the oscar for best song for `` shakedown '' -lrb- also nominated the golden globe -rrb- , and it won the razzie for worst original song for george michael 's `` i want your sex '' . okay !		4		0
-lrb- spoilers -rrb- oh sure they try very hard to connect the dots , but because of the idiotic film short at the beginning ... it 's totally lost on me . believability is thrown right out the window . i do n't buy it . the first movie had to do with the problems of street racing . this movie has nothing to do with it except the first 15 minutes . so now i ca n't compare on a sequel level . as a movie ... the fast and the furious was an okay movie . not perfect . better than xxx . but no gone in 60 seconds . 2 fast 2 furious ... is just your average standard go get the druggies movie . except the character of todd is brought over to this movie from the fast and the furious . he attempts to play the so called technical bad guy . which is just silly . and the setup so he gets caught is just silly . the dvd design is okay except they make tons of hoopla over suki . who plays just a small role compared to the undercover female customs officer . in the end . it 's okay to watch . but 1 . it 's not a sequel . 2 . hardly is about street racing . and 3 . is mostly a ho hum . the first was exciting , brazen , bold , and full of suspense . 4/10 quality : 2/10 entertainment : 10/10 replayable : 4/10		4		0
this is proof positive that what works in cartoons does n't translate well to live action . in cartoons , we do n't have the real world , so the stupid humor and simple jokes work , to a large extent . translate that same humor to a live action movie and it really hits you how dumb and puerile it is . ted , for a start , is inherently unlikeable as a character . to make matters worse , wahlberg 's character is equally hard to empathise with . he spends his days smoking pot with ted and watching old movies . both are horribly selfish . as an example of the sort of humor that you are supposed to find funny i give you this : upon returning home - to her apartment , no less - kunis ' character finds ted doing drugs with four prostitutes . that is n't the `` funny '' part . the supposed humor comes from the fact that , for a dare , one of the hookers has taken a dump on the floor . cue lots of laughter , right ? no ? oh , well then , you must not find it funny either . this is the kind of humor throughout ted . fart and knob jokes , drug-related mirth and other terribly unfunny lines . i guess when you write , star and direct a film you can start to believe your own press , but this is ridiculous . mcfarlane should stick to cartoons . at the very least , he could have tried to make ted not sound exactly like peter griffin . they even crack a `` joke '' about it at one point . ha , ha ! the basic plot is excruciatingly obvious from the start and means you can leave within twenty minutes and know exactly what will happen in the movie . i chuckled a few times , but ted is far , far , far from funny . most of the time any attempts at humor fall flat and sometimes the humor is just plain offensive . ted is a movie aimed a teens , and pretty juvenile and immature teens at that . it falls neatly into line behind such other recent `` comedy '' classics as your highness , and really makes you wonder how films like this can get greenlit by studios . is there nothing more worthy to make into a film ? summary : do n't believe the hype ! it 's overlong , tedious , unfunny and a waste of two hours . ted is charmless and boring . i 've had more fun sat staring at a dead fly in a dentist 's waiting room for thirty minutes . seriously , give it a miss !		4		0
this would be a decent ` film school project '' but falls short of a being a good film . most of the problem lies with the director -lrb- s -rrb- and his ham-handed approach . ***** some spoilers ***** obviously concerned that some viewer might not understand that a character is already dead , the director makes sure the actress is provided with a horrific gash across her face that does n't bleed . of course , she is already deathly pale and acts like a romero zombie . very subtle . when filming within the car , the windows are always fogged , while they are crystal clear in exterior shots . and , of course , there are always mysterious figures moving past the car windows just behind the actors when scenes are shot within the car . it looks like grips are setting up the next exterior shot . very disconcerting . like any decent twilight zone episode , the same footage is re-used to give an `` impression '' of driving along the road . in this movie , we get to see the same curve with wooden safety rail posts about six times ... turn slow right , then slow left . looks like stock film of the old pacific highway . the symbolism just gets slammed in your face at every opportunity , but this is probably as much the fault of the script as the director -lrb- s -rrb- . my favorite symbol is the `` ranger cabin '' , which is beaten to death the first time they pass it and is then used yet again in the identical manner . ***** end spoilers ***** with that said , it is worth a look , if only because the film-makers are so earnest in their attempt to translate a common theme into a big-screen twilight zone episode .		4		0
this was absolute gothic horror where 4 graduating high school teens waste a year in believing that they had killed a man who had crossed the road where they were driving . turns out that someone else killed him for accidentally killing their daughter . the real killer is after the 4 now and the film descends into complete madness . the killer walks around with a hook trying to kill his victims . the bodies pile up including the sheriff of the town and the sister of one of the girls who was riding in the car . does the hook killer actually think that he is captain hook from peter pan fame ?		4		0
two things came across my mind when i saw this dvd . the director is jamie blanks who i knew from his earlier flick , urban legend -lrb- 1998 -rrb- . great . on the other hand we have denise richard who i knew from starship troopers -lrb- 1997 -rrb- and wild things -lrb- 1998 -rrb- . but to be honest , denise was n't known for her acting skills but for her body and here she do shows again why . valentine started so nasty and full of suspense that i was thinking that we would have another teen slasher so well known in the nineties . sadly after the first killing it fails down all the way just to insert a few killings . there 's a red herring added at the plot but for me it was too late , the flick failed . the teen slashers were at it 's end in 2001 and horrors were becoming more gruesome with a new genre torture porn . cabin fever -lrb- 2002 -rrb- started the new ultra gore scene . valentine shows why the genre failed . it had nothing more to offer except beautiful women . for me it was a whodunit and definitely not a horror . even the characters i could n't care less , if they were injured or killed , i just could n't care . face it , it was the era were major studios wanted to pick up money on the horror genre but they were n't concerned about the horror , it had to sell , so no gore , no nudity . be my valentine , sorry , be my bloody valentine , get it ? gore 1/5 nudity 0/5 effects 2/5 story 2/5 comedy 0/5		4		0
well , i was n't expecting anything special but this is crap . it is n't about anything , other than the most basic plot you can think of - bruce banner on the run , general ross trying to stop him - with dialogue that swings between functional and outright shite . i 'm all for simple superhero action but even that needs interesting characterisation , a story , something to engage you . the visual effects are okay , but were done better years ago in ang lee 's storming and much underrated version . what surprised me most was the quality of the acting : ed norton is barely there , william hurt sleepwalks , tim roth is almost awful and liv tyler looks like a concerned cod from beginning to end . the score has its moments , but other than that this is a washout .		4		0
more of a psychological study than sci-fi . slightly interesting although it cheats its target audience in many ways . it would have been more honest to market this as a sad little soap . as it is , a well acted , well intentioned exploration of an elevation from despair to determinism . a tragic story of a lost intellect reduced to guilt and subservient labor and a literally destroyed father and husband portrayed as reclusive self pity and lingering physiological problems . what does this have to do with another earth ? it is wallpaper and a threadbare plot device that is unsuccessfully used to connect the little dots in the sky . the quantum psychics and parallel planet stuff is woefully wanting . very weak ending , both of them .		4		0
`` the chorus -lrb- les choristes -rrb- '' demonstrates that france is just as able to put out sentimental treacle as hollywood , for those who thought the gallic sensibility was inherently cynical , philosophical and intellectual or even romantic . there is a long cinematic history of similar movies . the brutal reform school lorded over by sadists genre of the british and irish movies , such as `` if '' and `` borstal boy , '' usually are from the point of view of the rebellious working class inmates , while the american version usually focuses on the inspirational teacher , not necessarily of the downtrodden unless race is also a factor , such as in `` dangerous minds . '' there 's `` to sir with love '' which brings in all these elements . and there have been several that use music as the key , from `` mr. holland 's opus '' to `` school of rock '' and `` music of the heart , '' some even based on true stories . the marginal originality here is that the focus is on a boys ' chorus performing classical music , but i always find those angelic voices more creepily pure than appealing , as they are just so fleeting until their voices change . it is annoying how quickly the sympathetic chorus master molds the kids into - there are n't even any rough rehearsals after the amusing scene where the kids reveal the little exposure they 've had to any sort of songs . we 're even robbed of the impact of the chorus on a key boy because the film is one long flashback . we only get a frisson of an implication of what else may have gone on in such schools as revealed in `` bad education -lrb- la mala educación -rrb- . '' this film is pretty to look at and listen to and predictable .		4		0
once again hollywood has ventured into a region it does not belong , this time being interpretation of biblical scripture . in this movie , the treatment of the subject of the apocalypse is so simplistic that it is embarrassing . has hollywood no shame ? is there anything the movie moguls will not film in their quest to make a buck ? everything about this movie is ludicrous , from the acting , to the art direction , to the ridiculous special effects , to the story itself . yet somewhere someone thought this story good enough to invest money in this project , which proves once again that , the current economic hardships notwithstanding , there 's plenty of money out there . yet the movie does feature some interesting and amusing scenes , such as the old lady who crawls on the ceiling and throngs of possessed people stumbling around with spinning heads . but enough said . if you want to learn more about the bible , pass on this movie and instead read the book . what is one to do when a old lady enters a restaurant , orders a raw steak and then proceeds to crawl on on the ceiling ? this is one of the interesting questions explored in this offbeat but entertaining take off on the apocalyptic theme . the movie has its flaws , such as its rather pedestrian interpretation of biblical scripture and its rather laughable special effects which could give some in the audience a headache -lrb- to appreciate this better one must see the movie -rrb- . if mankind is at the brink of extinction and must rely on one hero to save it , then we can only hope that that hero is not the angel michael depicted in this movie . angels are supposed to be powerful all knowing messengers of the almighty and should be depicted as such . to depict them as being something else is not only stretching literary license to the limit , it distorts the biblical message and reduces the movie to being just another fx extravaganza , interesting to watch but dramatically empty .		4		0
i do n't know anything of the writer 's or the director 's earlier work so i had n't brought any prejudices to the film . based on the brief description of the plot in tv guide i thought it might be interesting . but implausibility was piled upon implausibility . each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed , gruesome makeup , or special effects . the score was professional and kari wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing . it was positively repulsive . i will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but i 'll give an example of what i think of as an excess of explicit gore . chris mckenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim -lrb- wendt -rrb- out of the deep freeze . mckenna had killed wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck . now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in wendt 's demise . -lrb- what are the cops going to do , measure his bite radius ? -rrb- mckenna unwraps wendt 's head and neck from the freezer bag it 's in , takes an ax , and begins to chop off wendt 's head . whack . whack . whack . the bit of the ax keeps chipping away at wendt 's neck . the air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh , one of which drops on mckenna 's head . -lrb- he brushes it off when he 's done . -rrb- mckenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he 's built . he sits the head on the ground , squats next to it , takes out some photos of a woman he 's just killed , and shows them to wendt 's head . `` remember her ? we could have really made it if it had n't been for you guys , '' he tells the head . `` duke , you 've always liked bonfires , have n't you ? '' he asks . then he places the head on the fire . we only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame . i do n't want this sort of garbage to be censored . i 'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff . there 's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie . well , i 'll mention one example of an `` implausibility , '' since i brought the idea up . mckenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack . he knows he 's going to be clobbered half to death in the following days . -lrb- he 's literally invited the heavies to do it . -rrb- what would you do in this situation ? here 's what mckenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life . he finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates -lrb- successfully -rrb- . give that man the medal of freedom ! a monster who looks like pizza the hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks . the camera is often hand held and wobbly . the dialog has lines like , `` life is a piece of s *** . or else it 's the best of all possible worlds . it depends on your point of view . '' use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks . a house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero , mckenna , walks towards us in the foreground . some hero he is , too . he first kills a man for $ 13,000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue , then a potted plant , before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body . -lrb- this bothers him a little , but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment . -rrb- then , i hope i have the order straight , he kills wendt by ripping out part of his neck . then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it , although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it . next he burns the head honcho -lrb- baldwin -rrb- alive . then , having disabled the two lesser heavies , he deliberately blows them up , though one of them is n't entirely unsympathetic . and we 're supposed to be rooting for mckenna . these are n't cartoon deaths like those in the dirty harry movies either -- bang bang and you 're dead . these are slow and painful . the first one -- the murder for $ 13,000 -- is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life . it is n't really easy to kill another human being , as hitchcock had demonstrated in torn curtain . but that scene leads to no place of any importance . some people might enjoy this , especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies . some meretricious stuff on screen here .		4		0
the impossible looked like a very sentimental , unnecessarily sprawling and messy contrived film where the white family saves the locals but in fact , it 's the opposite , it 's about community and saving your neighbour and features all kinds of nationalities in dire situations together . when our protagonist family is in trouble , they are helped and then when others are in trouble , our protagonist family help them . human kindness is one of the most underrated virtues in cinema and how powerful it can be . the end of 127 hours where aron ralston finally finds people after being isolated for so long drags me to tears every time i see it . the impossible , while it 's not as cathartic because of the quantity , features human kindness to this level in all of its sequences . it 's a real emotional roller-coaster that 's brought to life by its director as the script does show risks of being sentimental and contrived , it 's played in exactly the right way . although the characters are a little underdeveloped , they are more vehicles for archetypes , it still hits hard . and it 's wonderfully overwhelming . as juan antonio bayona is a director of horror , having directed the popular the orphanage 6 years ago now , the terror of the tsunami scene is horrifying . there 's a realism and a scale to it that pinches your gut . with the breath-taking sound design and precise editing , it 's a masterwork in suspense despite knowing what 's going to happen from the trailers . it 's a truly immersive scene and every bump is felt . although there is a hint of realism in this sequence with a surprising amount of gore , the impossible is one of the most cinematic films i 've seen in a long time , especially with its sweeping and near impossible cinematography , having all those cranes in the water . while i feared it would be too epic for its own good , it goes to a manageable and focused scale that it makes work and still manages to be intimate . naomi watts is astounding . she 's probably the best actress today who can show pain and she marries the physical , emotional and psychological pain with the emotional core of her character incredibly well . she gives one of the best performances of the year for sure . tom holland is a welcome lead to the story and his bond with his mother is one of the most moving things about the film . ewan mcgregor is great in his role , despite not seeing him for the first half , and highlights the value of compassion . unfortunately , the film does lose some momentum after the reunion scene as there is little left to resolve for the last 20 minutes . i thought they were going to save it for the climax but it was just as cathartic as i hoped for . it does give it a brief feel of being procedural at that point as a mere retelling rather than storytelling , a factor that has been bugging me for 2012 when films have underwhelmed . but an ambiguous revisit to the tsunami brings things full circle and reminds us what an unforgettable moment that was . the impossible is pure cinema and personally , finally brings scale to a traumatic event that i remember hearing about and not comprehending when i was 12 . maybe bad trailers are a blessing since it 's the only way i can be surprised when they knock down my expectations . maybe the impossible grows on me . it 's lack of character personality and scattered flaws holds it back from being a favourite but as a technical feat it is astonishing . 8/10		8		1
if you like 1 -rrb- nostalgia , 2 -rrb- great acting , 3 -rrb- loving period detail and 4 -rrb- lavish location shooting then you ca n't not like this wallow in pre-war sentiment . if , on the other hand , you go wild , simple wild , for multiplex fodder then you 'll seriously wonder what is the point , in any , of this subtle , graceful charmer . no one is going to be bowled over to discover that judi dench , joan plowright and maggie smith are great actresses but many of us may have dismissed lily tomlin and cher as lightweights before this . judi dench 's husband , the late michael williams contributes one of his rare - and never less than excellent - screen performances as the english consul and franco zeffirelli directs this semi-autobiographical account of his early years with a sure touch . the film is something of a contradiction in terms in that despite the rise of fascism , the outbreak of war and it 's conclusion , not much happens ; by that i mean that the movie is more interested in the small group of expats and the small , motherless boy , who plays a role in all their lives than the world stage . ca n't really be praised enough .		8		1
i 've never seen the douglas sirk melodrama films of the 1950s though they 're definitely on my to see list . far from heaven is a clear homage to that sub-genre of film , with some slick dialogue that feels straight out of a film-noir , and it begs the question , can this work in contemporary cinema ? while some parts do n't , the answer is mostly yes . it 's a quietly touching film focusing on taboos of the time that seem strange yet sadly familiar to today . i love how the film always tenderly approached its issues and conflicts but it 's a shame that when these come to their boil that it sometimes feels out of place , especially as it 's a homage designed to reach these moments . but i do think that 's mostly due to the use of score as the acting and writing are always at their best as well as the magnificent lighting and cinematography . julianne moore gives a great subtle and utterly sincere performance that ranks among her finest but the true surprise standout is dennis quaid who is at his career best . patricia clarkson and dennis haysbert are delightful on the side , the only false note in the acting is the irritating misguided ryan ward , who plays moore 's son , but fortunately his appearance is brief . 8/10		8		1
after he ended his longtime collaboration with sam arkoff at american international pictures , jim nicholson started up his own company , academy pictures , to develop some high-quality horror projects . the legend of hell house was to be the first of many films he would be producing ; unfortunately , he died soon after the release of hell house . based on the bestseller by richard matheson , he adapted it -lrb- with a great debt owed to shirley jackson -rrb- and pretty much put it up on-screen intact with the able assist from director john hough -lrb- watcher in the woods -rrb- . what resulted is yet another entry into the top ten ghost stories of all time . the belasco house is the `` mount everest of haunted houses '' a repository of unlimited psychic energy and an evil so powerful and unrelenting that it seems to have physical substance . can it be destroyed , contained or at least studied ? physicist dr. lionel barrett -lrb- clive revill -rrb- intends to find out . accompanying him are three psychic mediums with different skills : his wife , ann -lrb- gayle hunnicutt -rrb- , the virginal florence tanner -lrb- pamela franklin -rrb- , and benjamin fischer -lrb- roddy mcdowall -rrb- . fischer is the only member of the team who participated in an earlier attempt to `` deconstruct '' the mystery of the house . he had a complete nervous breakdown , and every member of that party wound up dead . so why would he come back ? the same reason why a man almost killed climbing mt. everest would try it again ... because it 's there . and he 's determined not to let it beat him a second time . to prevent leaking any spoilers , i only want to add that if you want to be scared half out of your wits by something more than having fake blood literally dripping off your tv screen , turn off all the lights in the house and pop this one in ... alone . and no matter how much you want to do it , do n't turn them back on until the very end . for a movie made over thirty years ago , this still holds up surprisingly well . it makes one sadly wonder what great genre flicks nicholson could 've added to his company 's slate , had he lived a little longer . oh , yeah ! just to pique your curiosity even more , watch for a great cameo by one of the great british horror legends in hell house . i wo n't say who it is , but if you know your classic horror , you 'll recognize him right off the bat .		8		1
margaret `` marnie '' edgar is an attractive young woman who makes a living by stealing from her employers . she applies for a job under a false name , waits for an opportunity to embezzle money and then disappears before changing her identity and obtaining a job in another city . -lrb- one of the false names she uses is `` marion '' - possibly a reference hitchcock 's `` psycho '' , which also deals with a young female embezzler of that name -rrb- . her behaviour , however , is presented as the result less of dishonesty than of a psychological compulsion to steal . kleptomania is not her only psychological problem ; she also suffers from phobias about thunderstorms , the colour red and physical contact or intimacy with men . marnie 's obtains a job with a large publishing company and attracts the attention of mark rutland , the head of the firm . mark falls in love with his beautiful employee , and when he catches her stealing from the company blackmails her into marrying him instead of reporting her to the police . unsurprisingly , the marriage proves a disaster , and marnie attempts suicide on their honeymoon . mark realises that the only way to save his marriage , and possibly marnie 's life , is to unlock the dark secret buried in her past which is the cause of her psychological problems . when the film was released in 1964 it was not a success at the box-office . perhaps audiences of the day were put off by its frequently dark and challenging subject-matter , touching on such matters as frigidity , child molestation and marital rape . -lrb- the rape scene is omitted in some versions of the film -rrb- . some have seen a possible lesbian sub-text in the uneasy relationship between marnie and mark 's sister-in-law lil , although my interpretation would be that lil is in love with mark herself and that her feelings towards marnie are ones of sexual jealousy rather than sexual desire . audiences might also have felt that `` marnie '' is not what they had come to expect from alfred hitchcock . certainly , he had a deep interest in psychology and psychiatry , evident in films such as `` spellbound '' and `` psycho '' -lrb- and also , to some extent , `` notorious '' , `` strangers on a train '' and others -rrb- . `` marnie '' , however , is his most purely `` psychological '' thriller . the other films i mention are also physical thrillers with classic hitchcock thriller plots , either `` '' in `` spellbound '' and `` strangers on a train '' or `` woman-in-peril '' in `` psycho '' and `` notorious '' . `` marnie '' , on the other hand , is more heavily weighted in favour of psychological analysis , with little by way of physical suspense ; there is , for example , no equivalent of the shower scene in `` psycho '' . -lrb- the closest is possibly the scene where marnie , carrying out a robbery , is threatened with discovery by the cleaner -rrb- . what the film lacks in physical excitement , however , it makes up for in psychological depth . tippi hedren was perhaps an unlikely film star . she rose to fame as a fashion model in the 1950s , but had no acting experience apart from an uncredited , non-speaking role in one film , when , in her thirties , she was `` discovered '' by hitchcock and offered a part in `` the birds '' , largely on the strength of her physical resemblance to some of his other muses such as grace kelly and eva marie saint . -lrb- kelly wanted to use `` marnie '' as the vehicle for her return to the big screen following her marriage , until she discovered that her husband 's subjects did not wish to see their princess impersonating a mentally disturbed kleptomaniac -rrb- . this was the second of the two films hedren made with hitchcock , and she is excellent , better than in `` the birds '' . to portray a beautiful , elegant , woman , which is how marnie appears in the early scenes , would not have been too difficult for a professional model , but the ability to portray the deeply disturbed girl of the later ones clearly called for acting skills of a higher order . hedren 's performance here should be avidly studied by all those modern supermodels -lrb- far too many to single out by name -rrb- who assume that acting and the ability to sashay down a catwalk are one and the same thing . sean connery sounds too scottish to be entirely convincing as the american mark , but there is another first-class contribution from louise latham as marnie 's mother bernice . -lrb- domineering or over-protective mothers often appear in hitchcock 's psychological thrillers -rrb- . another point of interest is hitchcock 's use of colour . he anticipates nicolas roeg 's `` do n't look now '' in giving symbolic importance to the colour red , but whereas roeg 's film featured a bright red object in virtually every scene hitchcock uses the colour very sparingly . instead , most scenes are dominated by the complementary colour , green . there is some attractive photography of the verdant maryland countryside - winston graham 's novel was set in england , but hitchcock relocates the action to the area around baltimore - and most scenes include a prominent green object . when something red appears , it does so at crucial points in the plot connected with marnie 's phobias . there is also an striking musical score from bernard herrmann , his last for a hitchcock film . -lrb- he did compose one for `` torn curtain '' , but the director disliked it and it was never used -rrb- . `` marnie '' is not normally regarded as one of the great hitchcock classics , and until recently i would have agreed that it is not one of his best works , perhaps on a par with something like `` under capricorn '' or `` topaz '' . having now seen it again , however , i am prepared to revise my opinion . certainly , some of the criticisms made of it are justified ; some of the scenes are too lengthy and dominated by endless conversations , and there is some very unconvincing use made of devices such as obvious matte paintings and back projection . -lrb- at one point when mark and marnie are travelling in a car , it appears to be summer on one side of the road and autumn on the other -rrb- . it is , however , one of hitchcock 's profoundest analyses of human nature , exposing the dark depths which can lie beneath a calm , tranquil surface . 8/10		8		1
robert redford 's the conspirator dramatizes the military trial of mary suratt , a boarding house owner accused of harboring conspirators and being involved in the plot to assassinate president abraham lincoln . it is a strong , if somewhat obvious , drama that depicts the mood of hysteria that followed the assassination , and suggests its relevance to today 's politics . written by james solomon who spent fourteen years researching the story , the film opens with a brief introduction showing the agony of combat troops in the civil war , then focuses on the assassination of the president on april 14 , 1865 by actor john wilkes booth -lrb- toby kebbell -rrb- , a southern partisan and his companions lewis payne -lrb- norman reedus -rrb- , david herold -lrb- marcus hester -rrb- , and samuel arnold -lrb- jeremy tuttle -rrb- at the ford theatre in washington , d.c. . stealthily entering the president 's box , booth shoots lincoln in the head , then leaps onto the stage shouting `` sic semper '' -lrb- thus always to tyrants -rrb- , and escapes on horseback . the assassination results in an outpouring of grief all over the country , and prompts the secretary of war , edwin stanton -lrb- kevin kline -rrb- to vow revenge against the conspirators . after a two week search , booth is found hiding in a nearby barn and shot to death , while seven suspected co-conspirators are arrested including mary suratt . suratt is tried by a military tribunal where the rules state that only a majority vote is required for a guilty verdict and a two-thirds vote is needed to sentence a defendant to death . it is a court where a defendant is prohibited from testifying in their own defense . senator reverdy johnson -lrb- tom wilkinson -rrb- from virginia and a former u. s. attorney general agrees to defend suratt on the grounds that she is innocent until proved guilty . the senator , however , withdraws because he fears that being a southerner might prejudice his case , and asks frederick aiken -lrb- james mcevoy -rrb- , a northern attorney to defend her . initially reluctant and dubious about her story , aiken resolves to prove her innocence after seeing that the defendant was up against an overbearing prosecutor -lrb- danny huston -rrb- , a biased head of the tribunal -lrb- colm meany -rrb- , and the behind-the-scenes antagonism of secretary stanton . at great cost to his personal life , aiken tries to prove that ms. suratt knew the boarders who lived in her house , but was not involved in their conspiracy . as the case progresses , it becomes apparent that only her son john -lrb- johnny simmons -rrb- , a known conspirator who fled to canada , can save his mother by surrendering . while there is limited dimension to the characters , the conspirator is true to the historical record and the film presents its message in a clear and powerful way . redford , long a champion of civil liberties , implicitly reminds us that the fifth amendment to the u.s. constitution expressly guarantees that `` no person shall be deprived of life without due process of law '' and provides no exception for war . it is not only an important message for those unfamiliar with our nation 's history , but is strikingly relevant to the present day in which hundreds of detainees at guantanamo still languish in prison without trial , where a u.s. citizen , suspected of terrorist activities , is targeted for an assassination attempt without having been charged with , let alone convicted of , any crime , and where the ideal of due process and the presumption of innocence is slowly being replaced by unlimited violence , the repudiation of legality , and the undermining of democracy .		8		1
with some imagination , the best way to describe `` humanoids from the deep '' is calling it a nasty and perverted update of the `` creature from the black lagoon '' - premise . that classic jack arnold featured oppressed sexual undertones while is a downright outrageous and rancid flick . not bad to see a woman directs a more or less movie ... even though corman hired someone else to shoot extra . in many ways , it also feels like you 're watching an italian horror product ! the style and atmosphere of this film are so silly , the violence is so explicit and the plot rips off several other genre classics . do n't be fooled , however , because this is an authentic roger corman production and definitely one of the most entertaining ones he ever was involved in . the plot handles about ecologically mutated fish that attack a little during the annual . the creatures , which evolve amazingly fast , kill the men and rape the women . `` humanoids from the deep '' is an unbelievably entertaining gorefest ! the are some of the most efficient ever and they look truly despicable . the gratuitous nudity is -- of course -- a very redundant element but corman surely knows that it sells . as mentioned before , this film rips off quite a few genre hits and cleverly uses eerie ideas -lrb- and music -rrb- from `` jaws '' and `` alien '' . the make-up effects are simply disgusting ... and that 's a positive comment . especially the grotesque finale , set during the yearly festival , contains some sickness every self-respecting horror fan should see . even though the film could have used a little more humor to put it the wholesome into perspective a little , this surely is fundamental viewing for all fans of trash film-making . for some incomprehensible reason , corman also put his money in made-for-tv remake during the 90 's . that film might be fairly gore as well , but it entirely lacks the campy , light-headed fun of this original . make sure you watch the right version !		8		1
greetings again from the darkness . what a bleak commentary on one -lrb- really two -rrb- man 's slow slide into misery . the unfortunate partnership with john carpenter -lrb- not the famed director -rrb- brought the demise of not just the career , but the family life and personal dignity of the once loveable bob crane . this is no family flick , but director paul schrader does a masterful job of showing the destruction of two families due to crane 's weakness and addiction . schrader captures the feel of the 60 's and 70 's with not just the sets and wardrobe , but more importantly the social mores of the time . crane refuses to believe there is anything wrong with him ... `` tell them sex is normal '' . this shows that our actions are truly judged by others at all times . schrader also captures crane 's other addiction - celebrity . he loves being recognized in public and using that power to feed his darker side . the outstanding cast helps us stomach the 100 + minutes of bleakness . kurt fuller steals his scenes as , veteran ron leibman emotes empathy and disgust in a perfect balance as crane 's agent , rita wilson -lrb- ms. tom hanks -rrb- again shows why she should work more often , and maria bello -lrb- `` coyote ugly '' and an easy pass as `` the ring '' star naomi watts ' sister -rrb- all support the lead characters with abandon . make no mistake though , this is greg kinnear 's coming out party . the man can act . this is a long , long way from `` sabrina '' where he merely read his lines . he feels them now . schrader 's last bit of magic was casting willem dafoe as the sleezy carpenter . dafoe presents us with the touch of desperation necessary for someone who takes their pride from having the contacts with celebrities . you sense his pain as video becomes more mainstream and his only real talent becomes all but useless . best line of the movie comes from one of crane 's groupies when she asks , `` do you have any procol harum ? '' and carpenter replies , `` i 've got the four tops '' . she says , `` that 's close enough '' .		8		1
date night was a good date movie . yeah corny over used line ... i know but it fits this kind of movie . i watched this with , oddly enough , my wife -lrb- tried to borrow someone else 's wife ... , just kidding honey -rrb- . that 's the kind of movie this is , bringing out the dry humor that fits ohh so many married couples . anyway ... both my wife and i enjoyed the movie ... see it for yourself . now if you are single , divorced or recently married this movie will be boring and predictable . -lrb- just like my marriage ... ... whoa i am on fire -rrb- the movie is well written , almost too well written , moving at a perfectly smooth pace . there are plenty of quick jokes that married people will appreciate . they even found a way to include hot cars , gunshots and a car chase in new york . but seriously at the end of this movie you will appreciate your long , stable relationship like a pair of slippers that fit you just right . casting was perfect : carell does a great job of playing the average husband with the occasional outburst that has made him famous in 40yr old virgin and evan almighty . i love watching tina fey in her ' i just want a normal life ' role that made her famous in mean girls and baby mama . so it is a good movie for a date , of course you will have to watch matinée so that it finishes in time to go pick up the kids from school ... or else you have to wait until it hits the movie rental because you can not find a sitter you trust .		8		1
nearly forty years after having collaborated with salvador dali on `` un chien andalou '' , luis bunuel directed the equally bizarre `` belle de jour '' . catherine deneuve plays an unfulfilled parisian housewife who decides to take a daytime job as a prostitute . the movie contains two interesting dichotomies : on the one hand , it 's never totally clear what 's real and what 's severine 's imagination -lrb- the scenes where she gets whipped and raped look like her imagination -rrb- . similarly , we get to see cosmopolitan paris juxtaposed with the mildly seedy adventures in which severine takes part . maybe this is a slight allusion to the budding generation gap , which in france culminated in the student uprising of may 1968 . or maybe i misinterpreted the movie . but i will say that catherine deneuve displays the same masterfully scary flair that she did in `` repulsion '' . every camera angle and every edit combine to make one of the most impressive movies that i 've ever seen . i certainly recommend it .		8		1
not a big fan of dreamworks animation , but this was a fun movie . the plot is that a girl named susan is hit by a meteor on her wedding day that transforms her into a giant . -lrb- reminscent of the `` 50 foot woman '' and `` the amazing collosal man '' both of which have homages in the film . -rrb- she is locked up with a bunch of equally 's - copyrighted characters , including a gill man called `` the missing link -lrb- obviously , the creature from the black lagoon -rrb- insectosaurus -lrb- toho 's -rrb- , dr. cockroach , ph.d -lrb- the fly -rrb- and the gelatinous b.o.b. -lrb- the blob -rrb- . of course , despite the , none of these monsters are in the least bit as scary as their 1950 's counterparts , and the audience 's sympathies are immediately with them . this situation is immediately put into motion when an alien robot attacks the earth in search of the element that makes susan a giant . what follows are some fun scenes , something the kids will enjoy .		8		1
it 's hard to approach this movie on its own merits ; it 's only been ten years since sam raimi 's first `` spiderman '' film , and only five years since his series was rounded off in `` spiderman 3 . '' with these films still fresh in the consciousness , one ca n't help but to approach this reboot with the forethought that it 's completely frivolous and unnecessary , especially since it covers some of the same ground as the first original `` spiderman '' film . chances are that your decision to see and enjoy this film will be entirely biased based on your views on this , and your opinion on the other spidey films . hated tobey mcguire and sam raimi 's cartoonish style ? then perhaps this reboot will satisfy you better . otherwise , you might really will think it 's unnecessary . if you can push your memory of the other films out of your head , `` the amazing spiderman '' is a perfectly serviceable blockbuster . it has its share of action and special effects , especially toward the end with the climactic duel between spiderman and the villain . there are some fun heroics in the middle of the film . even when spidey is n't kicking butt and taking names , the movie 's comedy is successfully funny and the is not too overbearing . if anything , i felt this movie 's drama was more entertaining than in the other `` spiderman '' films , thanks largely to the film 's style and acting , but i 'm sure other viewers may disagree . the pacing is admittedly not perfect ; some parts whiz by and skim over some plot points , while other parts take their time . the best that can be said is that the film rarely drags . the story is familiar territory , albeit told differently . it may irk some viewers to have to sit through peter parker 's drama all over again ; i also found it a little disconcerting that many details have been withheld , presumably to be revealed in a sequel . still , the film does a fine job of telling the origin story , detailing the main character 's transformation into a superhero , and establishing all the characters and their relationships . in fact , character development is where the film excels : peter parker -lrb- and in turn spiderman himself -rrb- is a far stronger character , showing a broad range of emotions . it is a blast to watch his wisecracks and his attitude , but he does show a perfectly serious demeanor when necessary . filmed with solid , quality photography , the film looks stylish , without being cartoony like sam raimi 's films . the editing is good most of the time , with only a few parts that appeared choppy . acting is pleasing ; andrew garfield is impeccable as peter parker , emma stone makes for a perfectly likable love interest , and rhys ifans does his best with the villain . the writing is pretty decent . this film features plenty of good-looking sets , props , and costumes . there are some special effects that do n't look that good , but most hold up . music is pretty decent . ultimately , i felt it was a good film , and i really ca n't say whether i prefer this one or sam raimi 's films better . as it is , i like them all pretty equally . as for recommending `` the amazing spiderman '' to anybody else , i would only recommend a rental , because your enjoyment will depend on many variables . 4/5 -lrb- entertainment : good | story : good | film : good -rrb-		8		1
invited to return to spain , from mexico , to make a film in his homeland , i think it is safe to say the mr bunuel gleefully bight the hand that fed him . and quite right too . bold , brave and brilliantly spot on critique of the church , charity and human nature . the movie is also so wonderfully shot as we seemingly weave before , behind and alongside the various unfortunates brought into the household by the girl , of course , she means well enough but almost as soon as we meet her cousin , who appears off hand and pushy , with regard for nobody but himself , we ca n't help but get a whiff of reality . still very affecting after all these years this is a very fine piece of film making . nor is it all broad strokes , there are such wonderful little touches . the little girl 's skipping rope has at least three uses through the film . men get partially dress in women 's clothes twice . the great fernando rey , playing her uncle seems overly keen on his ex-wife 's shoes . also , as if the re-enactment of the last supper were not enough we have shades of necrophilia . amusing , provocative and ultimately optimistic , this is a rare delight .		8		1
julia roberts : hi ! do you like what you see ? i know my boobs are n't as big as the real erin brockovich 's but they 're still nice huh ? pimpin ' critic : yeah , they 're lovely breasts ! julia roberts : oh , thank you ! wan na have sex ? pimpin ' critic : yeah sure ! i 'll race you to bed ! ----------------- directed by steven soderbergh , this true story about a former beauty queen who takes a job as an investigator in a law firm and ends up suing the california power company for polluting water is actually a decent movie with decent . 3 -lrb- *** -rrb- out of 4 -lrb- **** -rrb- stars		8		1
i know this goes against the grain , but i did enjoy this sequel to beverly hills cop more than the original . i was not the biggest fan of the first film , it had its moments , but i did really enjoy this one . this one has foley returning to beverly hills to help the friends he made from the first film solve a set of robberies and a cop getting shot . i do not know , but i enjoyed the story more and i also enjoyed the inclusion of brigitte nielsen as the bad guy for the piece . she was rather good for a short stretch , but faded quite fast like a lot of actresses . i enjoyed the chemistry between murphy , reinhold and ashton my favorite scene where axel -lrb- murphy -rrb- and taggart -lrb- ashton -rrb- were discussing billy -lrb- reinhold -rrb- possibly having a problem as he had quite an assortment of weapons and gun paraphernalia . the action in this one is really good too and i like the humor a bit more here too . to me it is a better film , but that is me . most people like the first one better i imagine , i just thought this one had a bit more substance to it than the first film . i think this one is a wild ride and the cast is comfortable with their roles . i am sure we can all agree that it is a better sequel than the third movie .		8		1
this is a rewarding genre spanning film that combines elements of mystery , drama , humor , and romance in a uniquely compelling way . gene tierney is simply gorgeous in the title role of mrs. muir , while rex harrison 's bombast as the ghostly sea captain mellows over time to engage his house guest as a worthy companion and suitor . it 's intriguing that the story never goes in the direction of creating some sort of sexual tension between the principals . it 's all believably platonic , with the interjection of a suitable cad -lrb- george sanders -rrb- to woo mrs. muir in a relationship destined for failure . depending on your approach , the film can be interpreted on many levels . was mrs. muir 's ghost a figment of her imagination , a dream , or some other unexplained phenomenon ? one 's own interpretation may change upon subsequent viewings . i 've seen this picture a couple of times and found it to be a rewarding film with rich dialog , crisp photography and a wonderful bernard herrmann score to capture the ethereal mood .		8		1
i must say that i was pleasantly surprised by this movie . i really had no intention of seeing `` i , robot '' , but i kept passing it at blockbuster and i was extremely curious . some part of me wanted to be stubborn , but i finally caved in and rented it . i actually saw a good movie . from 2004 ! even though the computer effects are a little off the top , it goes well with the story . and you feel as if you are in place with this future . it was n't too outdone like `` the jetsons '' or anything like that . it 's based in chicago -lrb- excellent ! -rrb- in 2035 , so you get a kick out of seeing what it might be like in the future . `` i , robot '' is a good movie . i would recommend it . will made a great choice in participating with this film . he 's back and he 's better then ever ! 8/10		8		1
michael moore has never been objective . no documentary maker ever was . when you chose a subject , you 've already taken some kind of position and moore does n't try to hide what he thinks . and he shows us worker 's families being driven from their homes and brokers making profit on it . he shows business companies taking life on their employed and taking all the money when the employed dies . he says that the congress is in the hands of wall street and especially goldman and sachs . there are more examples . the interesting question is why michael moore is so alone making these kind of films in the us . the answer is probably that the investors do n't want him or anybody else to do them . they want to go on , treating the american people in the most terrifying ways . and since money seems to decide so much in that country , such films are very seldom made . but you 're not supposed to know .		8		1
last night 's viewing changed my mind ... this really is one of the great mgm musicals . strangely , this never held the same appeal for me as some of the other technicolor musicals of the period , but watching it last night for the first time in years , i appreciated what a really fine fred astaire was and what a gorgeous dancer and woman cyd charisse always was . mix in the great supporting cast -- jack buchanan who does a neat tap routine matching astaire every step of the way and hamming it up appropriately , and those two devils -- nanette fabray with her quick smile and oscar levant with his quick wit and you realize that comden and greene were two of the best comedy writers the screen had , this side of dorothy parker . the two musical highlights for me were `` triplets '' -lrb- smashing good job by astaire , fabray and buchanan -rrb- and the central park dance sequence that flows to the music of `` dancing in the dark '' . summing up : if you love mgm musicals , you owe it to yourself to see this one for the magic of astaire and charisse together , not to mention all the other plus factors -- costumes , scenery , backstage plot and those marvelous songs that come one after another to delight eye and ear ! and give jack buchanan a hand for squeezing every bit of ham from a role that calls for it , in spades ! almost forgot : the opening `` shine on your shoes '' number set in times square is a howl ! the only black seen anywhere is the shoeshine man himself .		8		1
brendan fraser may well have established himself as the john wayne of his day with his thrilling performance one can take the place of the duke of course , but fraser approached his character with just the right amount of swagger , wit , and take on an often told story has all the charm of the old saturday matinee 's of years gone by , and all the thrills of the raiders of the lost ark casting , with standout performances from everyone , particularly arnold vosloo , fraser , and oded recommended .		8		1
no way out is directed by roger donaldson and adapted to screenplay by robert garland from the novel `` the big clock '' written by kenneth fearing . it stars kevin costner , gene hackman , sean young , will patton , george dzundza and howard duff . music is by maurice jarre and cinematography by john alcott . already filmed impressively as the big clock in 1948 , fearing 's ingenious source material gets a shift to a pentagon backdrop and still comes out a winner . putting their own spin on the central story , that of a man finding he is investigating `` himself '' during a murder enquiry , the makers unfurl a labyrinthine plot that keeps up the suspense quota right to the very end . in true noir style , the story is crammed with double bluffs , deceit , sex and death , with the added ingredient of politico intrigue to spice things still further . cast are led superbly by costner and hackman , though young is a bit too dull an actress to really put fire into the key femme role , and alcott makes great use of the real washington locations to bring visual authenticity to the story 's setting . jarre 's score is hokey sounding and does n't sit right with the dramatics on show , while the big reveal at the finale is still as divisive today as it was back on the film 's release , but this is still a fine example of a film noir remake that really works for the neo-noir loving crowd . 8/10		8		1
audacious , delicious , exaggerated and preposterous , sofie coppola 's third film , marie antoinette , plunges into the life of the austrian princess who became queen of france and was beheaded in the revolution , following antonia fraser 's recent biography in describing her as a frustrated , lonely , brave teenager who never ceased to be a child and achieved maturity just in time to die . the film is a grandiose , sometimes touching , sometimes indigestible mixture . starting with kirsten dunst , a splendid actress , very touching in her openness -lrb- but does she know what it 's like to become a queen ? -rrb- and the sleek , stolid jason schwartzman , a now turned teenage king . shot largely at versailles , it 's lavish and authentic visually -lrb- or authentic-feeling ; furniture and clothing had to be invented -rrb- , but the film 's french characters speak in english and american accents and the musical background is full of eighties pop . fruit of a girlish fantasy , it 's a symphony of eye candy and real candy , bonbons and pinks and bright colors , a glorious superficial panorama that seeks to be a deep personal portrait of a tormented life . perhaps 7.5 / 10 for screenplay , but the counts for a lot . ms. coppola would have none of the sepia tones of historical `` masterpiece theater '' productions ; but this is n't such a boldly original step as the film 's promoters imply and the director herself acknowledges a debt to kubrick 's barry -lrb- and used the latter 's costume designer -rrb- . frears 's brilliant 1988 dangerous liaisons comes to mind , similarly light and bright . it 's also true that marie 's somewhat crude dialogue suffers by comparison with christopher hampton 's sharp adaptation of de laclos . the talk in marie is factual , or telegraphs information . the new film does n't evoke the wit and sophistication of the eighteenth century . the story , so detailed at first , seems rushed more and more as it goes on . but still it leaves you with something . and that something may be louis and marie going to bed -- and nothing happening , night after night . they did n't produce a child and maybe did n't even have real completed sex for the first seven years . one comes to feel sorry for louis too : there 's something helpless and sweet about schwartzman that makes the seemingly odd casting eventually pay off . coppola negotiates a narrow line between spectacle and intimate story . some of the moments are bombastic , as when the father louis xv -lrb- rip torn -rrb- or some chief of protocol stamps a staff on the floor , reams of blahnik shoes or pretty pastries flow by our eyes , we get a vast panorama of versailles or a huge elephant in our face , or a blast of organ music knocks us out of our seats . there are many royal eating scenes , the couple facing forward with vast symmetrical arrangements of food in front of them with the courses loudly announced , as in rossellini 's la prise du pouvoir par louis xiv . unlike rossellini , coppola does n't strive for an alienation effect but wants us to identify with the fourteen-year-old austrian girl from the moment she has everything taken away from her , even her dog , and is dressed in french clothes to meet the dauphin . we 're not very aware of the passage of time -- coppola 's movie tries too hard to avoid convention for that -- but our heroine goes through some heavy changes . she drinks and takes drugs -lrb- what 's in that pipe the women pass we do n't know -rrb- , she stays up all night , sneaks to paris in disguise for a masked ball , squanders millions on landscaping -lrb- which merely embellished le 's designs -rrb- and clothes and gambles and wolfs down so many sweets you wonder how he could get into those tight bodices . she gets heavily into the pastoral shepherdess scene and then has an affair with a sexy swedish count , axel von , played by jamie dornan , a former calvin klein model with long limbs and dreamy eyes , right out of a soap opera , or the cover of a pulp romance . the way the movie shows it , this indiscretion was soon over ; were n't there plenty more ? somehow there is n't time to show , with all the costumes and bonbons . this is where the movie most falls short : on a sense of events unfolding outside , or even inside ; it 's high on the emotions and the visuals , which never cease to be fun . even when king and queen are driving away to be beheaded , marie is looking out the window to admire the gardens . we get some court intrigue , notably conflict with louis xv -lrb- rip torn -rrb- 's mistress madame du barry , played by asia argento as a vampire of a vamp . ever present as a mean schoolmistress is the chief of etiquette , comtesse de noailles -lrb- judy davis -rrb- , forever frowning and stretching her long thin neck . and marie 's female play pals are lovely and cool . ultimately if all this elaborate stuff stands or falls with kirsten dunst , then it 's at least okay , because ms. dunst has innocence and freshness and aloneness about her , and she 's got the looks marie 's austrian background requires , and young as she is , she 's got the energy and presence of an experienced actress . this is n't a great movie but it 's a fabulous one . i dare queens to stay away . the screenplay really only rates a 6 or a 7 , but the of the mise-en-scene is so great i 'll be nice and award the film an 8 .		8		1
unlike many adults whose vision has become clouded by the weight of the current materialist paradigm , children generally are much more open to the mystery and wonder of the universe . most films geared to children , however , lack the vision to portray this wonder , resigning themselves to the conformist drum beat of ugly monsters and good versus evil confrontations . robert shaye 's the last mimzy , however , treats children like the caring , intelligent beings that they are , showing an appreciation of interesting and beautiful things that are available beyond ipods , computer games , and other forms of commercialized entertainment . based on a short story from 1943 by lewis padgett , a scientist from the future looks to children from the past to save his dying world . apparently the future world is so poisoned that people have to wear suits for protection from pollution . as 10-year old noah wilder -lrb- chris o'neil -rrb- and his 6-year old sister emma -lrb- rhiannon leigh wryn -rrb- discover an odd looking box that washes up on the beach near their family 's summer home in the seattle area , the door is opened to a non-linear reality that they could have scarcely imagined . in this reality , small rocks can spin on their own and provide the opening to a different dimension , a glowing crystal allows noah to teleport objects , a sea shell emits strange noises , and a stuffed rabbit communicates telepathically and tells emma that she represents future humanity 's last chance . newly possessed of heightened powers , noah is able to create a science project that deeply impresses his science teacher larry white -lrb- rainn wilson -rrb- . larry visits the boy 's mother -lrb- joely richardson -rrb- and father -lrb- timothy hutton -rrb- with girlfriend naomi -lrb- kathryn hahn -rrb- to tell the parents not only about noah 's science project but about the boy 's notebook which contains drawings of tibetan mandalas , images that the teacher has been seeing in dreams . he explains to the somewhat bewildered parents that mandalas may provide the path to focus meditation on healing the world . naomi reads the palms of the two children and finds an unusual purity in emma 's palm but neither she nor larry can understand or interpret the results or the changes taking place in the lives of the children . when noah 's experiments result in a sudden blackout of the entire seattle area , the feds naturally become interested . a homeland security official played by michael clarke duncan traces the source of the blackout to the wilder 's suburban home and , using the authority of the patriot act , storms into their home , confidently filling the role of villain . if you 've seen e.t. , you know that the children will become the embodiment of calm and reason while the adults remain clueless and panic hysterically at the sight of anything unusual . i welcome the fact that a major studio has produced a film for children that dares to introduce elements of eastern mysticism without the usual silliness attending such references . unfortunately , the film takes a scatter shot approach to spirituality , throwing together a smörgåsbord of palm reading , meditation , tibetan mandalas , lucid dreaming , mental telepathy , and levitation , in a way that lacks any organic relationship to the film 's message . however , while the last mimzy lacks the imagination and stylistic vision to be a fully satisfying experience , it is nonetheless a timely and entertaining film that children can appreciate and identify with and adults may find thought provoking . if it can make us all more aware that the infinite affection of children is needed to restore sanity to a troubled world , it will have accomplished something much more profound than spinning rocks .		8		1
even though he 's not always great , all of guillermo del toro 's films to date have at least been interesting ; cult flicks cronos and the devil 's backbone were brilliantly inventive , while his commercial output ; films such as blade ii , mimic and hellboy were also noteworthy . pan 's labyrinth has been released to almost universal praise , and that is n't surprising as although i wo n't heap quite as much praise on it as some have ; it 's a visually dazzling and overall satisfying piece , and certainly del toro 's best film to date . pan 's labyrinth is set in fascist spain during the second world war and focuses on a young girl named ofelia . she travels with her mother to stay with her stepfather ; the sadistic captain vidal . it 's not long before she is lead into the woods by a flying stick insect and meets a faun who tells her that she is , in fact , not a mortal human and is actually the son of the king of the underworld . however , in order to take her place at father 's side and become a princess , she must first face and complete three gruesome tasks ... a lot of the film revolves around the implications of a rebellion against the evil captain at the centre of the story , and this actually bodes surprisingly well with the fantasy element - which works as an ` escape ' from the second world war . obviously the best thing about this movie is and was always going to be the visuals . the film is a visual feast ; naturally there 's plenty of imagination and invention courtesy of del toro and this helps to give the film a real ` fairy tale ' feel . the fact that the film stars an eleven year old girl means that the film has a sort of ` kids flick ' feel to it , although this is brilliantly offset by plenty of sadistic violence from the antagonist , as well as some fairly graphic fantasy violence -lrb- a monster with eyes in it 's palms biting the heads off fairies , for example -rrb- . this may make the film seem like it lacks focus - but clearly pan 's labyrinth is a fairy tale for adults . the film is bolstered by a host of excellent performances from the largely spanish cast . ivana baquero is the standout at the centre of the movie - she puts in an amazingly mature performance for a girl of eleven . doug jones is also great opposite her as the mysterious faun . it all boils down to a satisfying and somewhat surprising conclusion and on the whole pan 's labyrinth is an amazing cinematic achievement .		8		1
lolita : that `` lovely , lyrical , wilting name '' . after nabokov 's novel and kubrick 's film adaptation , the name lolita has , unfortunately , become synonymous solely with sexual precociousness . really , we should add ` vulgar ' and ` brash ' to that - the real dolores haze -lrb- sue lyon -rrb- is brusque , and anything but wilting . she 's known by two names ; she leads two very different lives . given the reputation that follows the tale of lolita around , it 's sometimes easy to forget how funny this first -lrb- and best -rrb- film adaptation is . with kubrick , we 're in the hands of a master satirist . so when lolita is shipped off to the hilariously named ` camp climax ' , her emotional farewell embrace with humbert humbert -lrb- james mason -rrb- is cut short with what amounts to a snappy `` see ya '' before the camera swoops over our troubled anti-hero as he gazes longingly over the banister , full of yearning and repressed passion , while melodramatic music swells like something out of gone with the wind . humbert is an amusingly sardonic sort when he knows he 's going to get what he wants ; he 's stroppy when he ca n't . so , while we 're never offered any backstory to help us build a psychological justification for humbert 's infatuation , we can clearly see that his passion brings out the teenager in him : fickle , randy , playful and obstreperous . shelley winters marvellously dolores ' lonesome mother , the actress 's alleged poor treatment by the director pre-dating shelley duvall 's by almost 20 years - and , similarly , it could be argued the performance is improved accordingly . this was kubrick 's first collaboration with peter sellers -lrb- who plays the writer clare quilty -rrb- . like dr strangelove , there 's an exhilarating unpredictability whenever the chameleonic sellers occupies the screen . this was the first time kubrick encouraged improvisation - it 's partially this , i believe , which elevates the film to the status of the first true kubrick classic . paradoxically , with lolita we 're able to see the control kubrick would wield thereon ; he arrests the image , moving the actors with the precision of chess grand-master , shooting everything from the beautiful to the banal with sublime artistry .		8		1
writer / director matt reeves -lrb- `` cloverfield '' -rrb- clearly has nothing but the utmost respect for the swedish novel and film `` let the right one in '' , and his faithful adaptation is a reflection of that . this is a very affecting combination of horror and drama that does n't skimp on the horror , and also works extremely well at portraying a somewhat unconventional , but heartfelt , friendship . it wo n't hold any surprises for those who have seen the swedish film , but it 's fundamentally a good , meaty story that is well told . taking place in 1983 -lrb- with song choices ranging from david bowie to blue oyster cult to greg to remind us of the era -rrb- , it charts the evolution of this friendship , as meek , bullied owen -lrb- kodi smit-mcphee -rrb- meets a strange 12 year old girl , abby -lrb- chloe grace moretz -rrb- whom he only sees at night , and who travels with a much older guardian -lrb- richard jenkins -rrb- . exceptionally well shot by greig fraser in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio , this begins on a truly atmospheric note , and makes the most of the setting , as the setting is new mexico during the winter . reeves comes up with some interesting ways to stage scenes , such as filming a car crash from the interior of a car , and a climactic scene in a pool . it 's sometimes effectively gory , although never gratuitously so ; it also delivers a hell of a kick in a hospital room scene . sometimes digital effects are utilized for scenes where abby is in attack mode , and considering the low key nature of the rest of the film , they do take one out of the film a little too much . the characters are well rounded individuals in whom we can easily take an interest and follow for the duration of the film . the two juvenile leads are impressive , delivering sensitive and mature performances ; smit-mcphee and moretz look to have solid careers ahead of them . elias koteas co-stars as the detective on the case ; he and jenkins are solid as always and the latter has some really great scenes with young moretz . key to the success of the film is how engrossing the story telling is . for a movie running just a little under two hours long , it never feels that lengthy and in fact moves along quite well . the ending falls short of complete satisfaction -lrb- it would have done well to tie up its loose ends -rrb- , but overall this is an intelligent film with a heart and soul ; the music score by michael giacchino adds to the emotional impact . highly recommended to lovers of horror looking for a break from the usual run of hollywood genre product . eight out of 10 .		8		1
a few unfortunate lines of dialogue aside , it 's hard to see why luc besson 's epic was met with such derision - it 's full of some terrific film-making , the battles are the right size , the story 's well-told and milla jovovich comes over surprisingly well as someone caught somewhere between god 's will and psychosis . the inclusion , two hours in , of dustin hoffman as her conscience to address her own and the audience 's doubts as to whether she is driven by divine guidance or self-delusion is an inspired touch that is completely unexpected in a mainstream epic on this scale . unfortunately , it 's also the point when the film almost crosses the line into monty python - the dialogue 's just too funny too often , and somehow the notion of a 15th century french catholic peasant girl 's conscience manifesting itself as a new york jewish actor in a cowl does n't seem overly likely . curiously , these scenes work better on a second viewing when you 're not caught so off-guard by them . on a narrative level , these scenes do help punctuate the back-and-forth nature of the trial , but it would have probably been much better to have her in her cell talking to her unseen visions . there are still some compensations . the trial is well-handled , and timothy west avoids the kind of ham that usually marks his cinematic turns -lrb- cf cry freedom -rrb- to give a surprisingly good performance as a mainly decent man trapped in an impossible situation , very similar to ray 's role in the mission . it 's not a flawless film by any means , but it is one of the better and more ambitious 90s epics and one that 's long overdue for reappraisal .		8		1
five years ago i wrote a snotty imdb review for this movie after seeing it at a local theater . now i just saw it again on dvd and wonder what the hell i was thinking . first , it 's terrific . second , i got what was good and bad about it exactly wrong . joe and paul fabrini -lrb- george raft and humphrey bogart -rrb- are two wildcat truck drivers struggling to stay one step ahead of their creditors . their job requires long hours on the road and prevents them from getting enough sleep . paul 's wife -lrb- gale page , who gives the only colorless performance in the film -rrb- worries she 's going to find herself a widow someday and for good reason . joe , paul and a hardboiled waitress -lrb- ann sheridan -rrb- they pick up hitchhiking are witness to just how dangerous the business is . they watch in horror when the driver of the truck ahead of them falls asleep and runs off the road ; both men inside die in a fiery explosion . it proves to be a glimpse of joe and paul 's future when they wind up in their own accident . that leads joe to go to work for an old friend , who now runs his own trucking business . ed carlsen -lrb- alan hale , in a splendidly boisterous performance -rrb- is rich and successful , but he 's still a regular fellow and has n't lost the vulgar manners of his class . this annoys his wife lana -lrb- ida lupino -rrb- to no end . she 's clearly nouveau riche herself , but wants to rise above the low-class antics of her husband . and she 's in love with joe , who wants nothing to do with her . this drives her to commit murder . that 's when the movie changes coarse and for the worse . but five years ago i preferred the second half of the movie to the first . i guess i just have a weakness for murder stories , but the movie is clearly better before it becomes one . the murder sequence itself is packed with drama , but this plot twist sends the movie spiraling down until it reaches the tedious courtroom montage , which climaxes with ida lupino , who has been terrific up until this point , having a campy nervous breakdown on the stand . -lrb- `` the doors made me do it ! the doors made me do it ! '' -rrb- and the less said about the phony feel-good last scene -lrb- where bogart winks into the camera -rrb- the better . raft is fine in the lead , but modern-day viewers will almost surely wish that he and bogart had each other 's parts . bogart was still a year away from graduating to leading man status . he 's fine in this supporting role , but it 's a shame the movie neglects his sympathetic character during the second half . i roscoe karns as a pinball fanatic . he 's funny when he seems to be only a walk-on character , but he overplays his later scenes as a comic drunk . best of all is ann sheridan , who delivers her lines like she 's cracking ice . she 's tough but softens once she falls in love . the movie never should have thrown her out of the spotlight and put ida lupino 's character in her place . she was -- and should have continued to be -- the heart of the movie .		8		1
guillermo arriaga 's film ` the burning plain ' is a clever , multi-layered story of the intersecting lives of four female protagonists . it 's well acted and filmed , and the background score is classy ; but it 's not quite great . firstly , the device of telling each story in fragments , and not in chronological order , does n't quite deliver the pay-off one might hope for : the final explanation is , perhaps , nothing other than what one might have expected . and secondly , perhaps its this very device which explains why the film is n't quite as emotionally involving as one might expect for a movie whose individual scenes are so well executed . i still enjoyed it , and it 's a cut above most mainstream fare ; but it never completely transcends its schema .		8		1
while traveling to california for the dispute of the final race of the piston cup against the king and chick hicks , the famous lightning mcqueen accidentally damages the road of the small town radiator springs and is sentenced to repair it . lightning mcqueen has to work hard and finds friendship and love in the simple locals , changing its values during his stay in the small town and becoming a true winner . in the cute `` cars '' the world is inhabited by automobiles and there is a great message about the meaning of friendship in the wild contemporary competitive world . the hero learns the important lesson that sometimes the true winner is not the one who simply wins the race but uses the heart and does the best . owen wilson is amazingly funny giving the voice to the rookie lightning queen and it is amazing how some intellectuals do not like this adorable animation . or maybe they do not have understood the message of the story . my vote is eight . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` '' -lrb- `` cars '' -rrb-		8		1
after one-and-a-half decades , this is now the fourth film in the series , and the series overall has had massive ups and downs . the first original film has memorable moments , but the sum of its parts never was greater than the parts themselves . the second film is just whack . the third managed to tie in quality substance and action , with only some annoying shaky-cam to disrupt the experience . as such , i believe this fourth installment is the best of the series ; it finally manages to weave action , storytelling , and style in a seamless fashion . the film starts off quite fast and remains throughout . there are some excellent action setpieces throughout , filled to the brim with pursuits , chases , and fights . even when the characters are n't running for their lives , the espionage proves very intriguing as various situations are set up that require the characters to use their skills to get by . the story for this does n't have the same investment in the characters as `` mi : iii '' did -lrb- especially since there is no standout villain -rrb- , but quality characterization and progression still exists in the background . what really matters here is the political intrigue , which cleverly sets up a scenario where the characters lose their backing organization and they are all forced to complete their mission with limited tech -lrb- although what tech we see is still pretty damn cool -rrb- and no backup . it 's easily one of the more satisfying spy thrillers in the genre , and certainly one of the most exciting ; it 's just not quite as deep in terms of characters or themes . thankfully , the photography and editing for this film are quite sane and stable ; the camera is not as jittery as `` mi : iii . '' acting is pretty fun all around ; tom cruise generally has his ups and downs , but i certainly enjoyed watching simon pegg , paula patton , and jeremy renner in their roles . it was kinda interesting to see michael nyqvist as the villain . writing is decent . this production spares no expense on the sets , props , costumes , locales , and special effects . music is pretty cool . 4/5 -lrb- entertainment : 4.5 / 5 , story : 4/5 , film : 4/5 -rrb-		8		1
barrie is a very well-known writer that is in a : he has no inspiration . this changes when he meets davies family , which will make him recover inspiration and make him to create the wonderful world of neverland ; writing the very well known book `` peter pan '' with a great directing the film shows us the inside world of the writer , being more time in his imagination rather than in reality , which creates a world of fantasy and enjoyment . actors are spectacular , specially johnny depp -lrb- his nomination is totally deserved -rrb- and dustin hoffman -lrb- hook again ? -rrb- . the dressing and the photography is quite good also , as we are in front of one of the best films in 2004 . the film claims for the triumph of fantasy , as if you do n't like this world , just imagine a new one and live there -lrb- this can not always be good -rrb- ; and also the film has a remembering that , despite the fact that you can live in other world , there is , here , the real world and you can not avoid that if you can not life here , probably there you will not be happy at all -lrb- or not for a long time -rrb- . the film is good , but the starting is a little slow and i 've missed at least some comment 's about the darkest aspect of barrie : the adultery , pedophilia ... all in the puritan victorian age , the same that made wilde to commit suicide ; a larger mention of these aspects i think could have done this film to be better .		8		1
quentin tarantino is my favourite writer/director of all time . the dialogue in his films is pure gold and it keeps you entertained more than most other movies . the film is 2 hours and 45 minutes long , but it sure did n't feel like it , aside from some pain in my leg . the characters were great , my favourite being dr. schultz . the leads are well developed , and all have their moments . just to summarize , the acting was good and you believed who the characters were . the violence in this film is something only tarantino would do , when people get shot , they turn into blood fountains . it is on par with kill bill in terms of gore . the cinematography was beautiful and the soundtrack was really good , it fit well with the film . the plantation shootout towards the end was incredible and extremely bloody , i felt that should have been the end because it was such a big and memorable scene , and the film slowed down after that adrenaline rush . i 've been seeing a lot of reviews giving this film a 1 star rating , why ? because they do n't understand tarantino or the type of movie he was trying to make , this film is presented like a mix of inglorious basterds and exploitation films from the 60s and 70s . this movie is not meant to be taken seriously , but people just do n't understand , the people complaining or over sensitive or only enjoy uber serious movies . and people complaining about the over use of the n word is ridiculous , have they even scene pulp fiction or jackie brown , plenty of n words in those but no one complains . there are a lot more offensive movies out there that do n't get as much hate . anyone who has seen his prior work will understand why the movie is like it is.this film was a really good time , and very funny , the audience liked it a lot . it was good to finally see a tarantino film on the big screen and an overall memorable experience . not his best film , but definitely one of the best films of the year . jan 18 : i just saw an article that states the following , collectible line is discontinued . that hurts and it hurts hard . i am a big fan of action figures and collectibles , and was looking forward to buying a hot toys figure , well i guess i 'll just go buy a hanz landa one instead , what a joke . i can buy a nazi , but i ca n't buy a german dr. , that is ridiculous , just think about that for awhile .		8		1
as documentaries go , this is one of the most powerful i 've seen . it definitely overshadows any efforts by `` documentary '' maker michael moore , with his legendary `` facts '' . seeing the effects on the body of a month of eating at mcdonald 's 3 meals a day and as an analysis of their mass marketing techniques , this was thoughtful , insightful and well structured . definitely a must see , and the only disconcerting thing was how much his gp looked like saddam hussein ! i must admit though , i found his vegan girlfriend annoying , and that would be enough to drive me to mcdonald 's just to annoy her ...		8		1
a british soldier jody -lrb- forest whitaker -rrb- is kidnapped and held hostage by ira . fergus -lrb- stephen rhea -rrb- is one of the terrorist , who are guarding him and during the three days he develops a soft spot towards the hostage and after jody asks him to deliver a message for his girlfriend dil -lrb- jaye davidson -rrb- , fergus reluctantly leaves to do so , after the thing blows a part . be it real love , or just a hard case of sense of duty , fergus locates dil and after it is apparent , that his ira mates want him to do an assassination job , or the girl gets it , he has to do something to protect her . `` the crying game '' , a movie that is known for its surprise twist , which might even be offensive to some , toys around with emotions and their triggers . it has a lot of humor in it , and while being rather dramatic in some places , it manages to ask some questions like why do we fall for people we fall and why do some people make us do things we normally would n't . in all , `` the crying game '' is well acted and written film , that flows forwards withe ease . well recommended .		8		1
there are certain elements of the alamo that should have universal appeal . they are the strong acting of the leads , the sure handed direction of john wayne , and the impressive sets and stunt choreography . to be honest though , to fully enjoy this film it is almost necessary to be sympathetic to the american point of view rather than the mexican point of view in the conflict . most members of the traditional american majority view the stand made at the alamo as one of the most heroic and inspiring episodes in u.s. history . this sentiment is clearly evident in older history books and in the huge popularity of davy crockett in the fifties and early sixties . nowadays , though , with the growing latino demographic in california and the southwest , popular sentiment is shifting towards the slant that texas was stolen from mexico . personally , i enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes westerns and/or john wayne . 8/10 .		8		1

funny 1963 film re-teaming the great jack lemmon and shirley maclaine once again . as he was in `` hot , '' lemmon is another good-natured jerk , who falls for hooker maclaine and accepts another identity so as to keep her going financially and off the street . while lou jacobi is appealing in the role of the , his main presence is a major reason for the downfall of this film . when lemmon is blamed for killing off the character he has been portraying , jacobi knew all this and could have gotten lemmon off . instead , he continues the charade which lands lemmon in jail unnecessarily . some may call this comedy , i call it stupidity . lemmon is wonderful as always as the cop and as the street-walker , mac laine delivers another oscar nominated performance .		8		1
i 've always been a great fan of historic drama 's , but the medieval times are not really my favorite . normally i prefer the period between 1900 and 1950 or the roman / greek times when i want to watch such a movie . only when i 'm almost sure that the movie that i 'm about to see , and which is n't situated in one of these time periods , will be better than average , i 'm willing to give it a try . that 's also the reason why i saw `` the messenger : the story of joan of arc '' . when in a girl called jeanne is born in a small village in france , the hundred years war with england makes life very difficult . she grows up as a very religious young woman who confesses several times a day and at the age of 13 , she has her first vision when she finds a sword in a field . when she returns home with it , she finds the english looting and murdering her town . many years later , she is convinced that it is her holy duty to be ridding france of the english . that 's why in she meets charles , the dauphin of france , who is so desperate that he accepts all help , even when it comes from a 16 year old maiden with a divine mission . after she successfully liberated orléans and reims , the dauphin is crowned traditionally in the cathedral of reims . from that moment on he does n't need her anymore , since his wishes are satisfied , and after he betrays jeanne d'arc , she is imprisoned by the burgundians . they organize a trial against her under english law , but ca n't force her to confess about her divine visions which she has had continuously since childhood . condemned of witchcraft and being considered as a relapsed heretic , she is sentenced to death and is burnt alive at only 19 years of age . the story is of course what it is . because this is a movie that has been based on a biography , which already exists for a few hundred years , much ca n't go wrong . only when the writers had added a lot of new elements to it , which i do n't think they have done , this could have become a really awful movie . now i had the feeling that they followed the original story pretty well and that 's why this has become a more than decent movie . sure , by today 's standards this story is n't very believable , but that 's not what you should keep in mind when watching it . if today someone would claim that she was sent by god to free us from evil , she would end up in a straitjacket and a mental hospital pretty soon , but all this happened in the 15th century , when people were much more religious and still believed such claims . when it comes to the battle scenes , you can expect a lot of brutal violence . a lot of dismemberment , people being hit by a large number of arrows or cut into pieces with a sword , ... you will not be spared of anything of that . personally i do n't have any problem with it , because that 's the way it was at the time , but i 'm sure that not everybody will be able to look at it . but the entire movie is n't made up by such scenes of course . the most remarkable ones are probably those in which she has a vision . the way those were shot is really very nice and give it that extra mysterious feeling . also worth noticing are the nice costumes and decors , which give a good impression of the time shown in the movie . the direction and the performances by the actors are the last thing that i want to tell you something about . i already knew that luc besson knows what a good movie should look like , but an historic drama is still something completely different from a sci-fi movie like `` the fifth element '' , in which you can let your imagination run freely , or a completely over-the-top comedy like `` taxi '' . but what he did looked nice and that 's what 's the most important . of course he also had a nice cast to work with . with people like dustin hoffman , faye dunaway and john malkovich he had some very famous and talented actors to his disposal . but even the other actors , with milla jovovich on top , were much better than average . in the end this is a movie that offered plenty of entertainment , nice shots , a good story ... and that 's why i find the current rating of 6.3 / 10 too low . i would give it a rating of at least 7.5 / 10 . in my opinion it does n't deserve any less .		8		1
although in the western world , crime has often become a kind of entertainment or top story in media , then total cover-up plus of public hinder the work of police forces - as depicted in citizen x which is based on true events and characters in the last decade of the soviet union and first years of independent russia . even much smaller crimes were concealed and if/when disclosed , they were explained as fruits of `` rotten capitalism '' . as for more than half of chikatilo 's victims , the soviet system has direct complicity . the movie was shot in hungary and several hungarian actors were used , but russian landscape and gloominess of a soviet province are recorded in a realistic manner -lrb- with some typos in , however -rrb- . the stars of the movie - stephen rea as viktor burakov , donald sutherland as mikhail fetisov , jeffrey demunn as andrei chikatilo , max von sydow as dr. alexandr bukhanovsky - are really splendid , perhaps too much , as most people filling high communist posts in a province did not excel in their outer intelligence ... but still , their performance is catchy to follow and the big changes in the society due to perestroika are well understood and depicted logically . the movie is also a good history lesson for younger generations not aware of the features of the soviet system . citizen x should definitely deserve more attention it has seen so far .		8		1
i love george a. romero 's zombie flicks ! my favorites are night of the living dead , dawn of the dead , and land of the dead ! day of the dead and now diary of the dead are my least favorite . i do n't hate them , they are just kinda weak . i was really pumped to see this movie because it was a new beginning to romero 's zombie series . i was expecting to see people being ripped apart by zombies , but that did n't happen . i do love the opening scene , with the immigrant family coming back and eating people . i love the background in the opening too , that orange kind of sunset is really awesome ! jason creed wants to make a mummy movie for his college class , then his friends hear about the zombie epidemic . they all get in a winnebago and look for help . the whole movie takes place on a hand-held camera . there are some cool zombie gore scenes . some parts are kinda boring . if you love zombies and george a. romero , you might like george a. romero 's diary of the dead !!!		5		0
as the movie began , it seemed that we were in for a sort of whimsical , `` ghost busters '' like story of the attempt to capture ghosts . then , as the movie continues , it turns into more of a horror movie than a typical ghost movie -lrb- i do n't necessarily consider those to be the same thing . -rrb- the problem is that it does n't really work that well regardless of which genre you try to fit it into . no doubt it 's creative . the story -lrb- once you figure it out - and it is a bit confusing -rrb- has to do with the so-called `` black zodiac '' and the attempts of a mysterious figure -lrb- played by f. murray abraham -rrb- to amass great power by capturing the ghosts required to fill out this zodiac . the zodiac requires twelve ghosts , all of whom have to fit a certain `` type , '' and then a 13th ghost is required - the ghost of a person who has to voluntarily give himself out of love . cyrus -lrb- abraham -rrb- chooses his nephew arthur -lrb- tony shalhoub -rrb- to be the 13th ghost and lures them by faking his death and willing arthur and his family a strange house , which is n't actually a house but a `` machine '' of sorts whose purpose is to bring forth the power cyrus wants . the `` '' was both a strength and a weakness . it was very well designed and very mysterious , and yet it also seemed overdone in some ways . it was too much , and it - rather than the ghosts or the people - tended to become the focus of the movie . there are a handful of scenes of gore -lrb- notably the lawyer being sliced in half -rrb- and some decent enough frights and chills -lrb- confined mostly to the last half hour or so . -rrb- the story really is n't very well developed , though . the very last scene of the movie is an unfortunate attempt at humour that added nothing to one 's memory or appreciation of the movie . it 's a mediocre effort .		5		0
i watched this movie in the cinema -lrb- on free tickets , mind you -rrb- and must say that i was surprised by the movie . i thought it was going to be another chick flick , but the movie was more than so . the movie is pretty much moving forward in a good pace , except towards the end where it started to become a drag . the story is adequate , but nothing that you have n't seen before if you are a movie fanatic . lots of small and nice details throughout the movie , though . as for the acting , well that was top notch . it was really some good performances you get to see the actors and actresses put on here in this movie . and that really kept the movie afloat . there is some cliché tone to the movie , given the morals of the story . but hey , then again , so are so many other movies . `` an education '' is not a movie that i would go to watch again , once was enough . but if you are a fan of movies heavy-set with morals , then you might find this to be quite interesting . good enough for an evenings entertainment , but not .		5		0
** out of -lrb- **** -rrb- `` hostel '' is n't a historical landmark in cinema , nor does it have the slightest chance of snagging an academy award . instead , it 's a film with an interesting concept , but with incompetent directing and shoddy performances , it 's middle-of-the-road at best . roth can show the most disgusting , vile death that makes the hairs trickle on someone 's back , but we 'll still be left in the cold . gore , t & a , i think we know where this is going ... hostel revolves around a group of backpackers that meet up some voluptuous , twenty - somethings and drink , have sex , and crash a night . however , their idea of fun turns into a living hell when they are succumbed to torture and misery . first of all , with a premise such as that of `` hostel '' , i do n't think you 'll hook your audience in with forty five minutes of pure filler . there 's no character development . no purpose . it 's not even entertaining . booze , sex , boobs , nightclubs , all . it 's just not exciting or fascinating , especially with characters as flat as these . thanks to the direction , which is very cheap . you can tell the film was made for less than 5 million . however , all snarky comments aside , i did enjoy the film to some extent . i thought the last twenty minutes were exactly what this film should 've been like . gritty , suspense , and keeping you guessing on all accounts . all the chaos and mayhem just seep through the cracks . all in all , roth can throw as much skin and red fluids as he wants at the audience , but if you have an absence of character development and a non-existent story , the direction becomes corrupt . roth , i appreciate the effort because i know somewhere along the way , a good film was made . unfortunately , roth did n't find that film .		5		0
i am going to make this review short for now , with the intention to expand it upon a second viewing if one ever occurs . my understanding of this film is that it was a complete failure during production . they redesigned the film to give wesley snipes more screen time , as he was a rising action star . and they changed the name from `` money men '' to `` boiling point `` to imply that it 's an action film . well , quite simply , it 's not . there 's some twists in the plot , but no real action . wesley snipes is a good lead , but more interesting is dennis hopper as red diamond , a prostitute lover and crook . hopper has said he considers this his best role , which may be true , but it 's embedded in a bad film . and most interesting ? viggo mortensen in an early role as hopper 's crook friend . had the film 's creators had the foresight , they would have cut down on snipes and expanding mortensen . and , you know , with no fan following , we 'll never see a director 's cut . not a must-see .		5		0
fed up with the hustle-bustle of new york city life , documentary filmmaker dennis quaid -lrb- as cooper tilson -rrb- and sexy sharon stone -lrb- as leah -rrb- opt for the serenity of country life . they move , with beautiful kids kristen stewart -lrb- as kristen -rrb- and ryan wilson -lrb- as jesse -rrb- , into a dilapidated old mansion . but , `` cold creek manor '' proves to be no `` green acres '' . the couple 's `` eb '' appears in the form of studly , ex-con stephen dorff -lrb- as dale massie -rrb- . since he used to live there , mr. dorff slithers in , invites himself to dinner , and convinces mr. quaid he should be hired as handyman ... hiring dorff to work on restoring his old swimming pool ... on the house the tilson family bought on foreclosure ... while dorff was in prison -lrb- ! -rrb- qualifies quaid as a classic haunted house dummy . this scene , which signals the film 's demise , could have easily been fixed by having stone hire dorff while quaid was out of town -lrb- picking up some home improvement supplies -rrb- . this would have played up the attraction between stone and dorff ; and , it would have given the younger cast a chance to make clearer the violent and incestuous relationships dorff had with his own children . this film would probably work better if the performers were n't so good - it 's very difficult to imagine this cast being so stupid . scripter richard jeffries fills the characters with intriguing backstories , but none are played out with any effectiveness . most obviously lost is the promising effort to parallel stone and the kids with dorff 's similar , but `` missing '' , family members . the fact that the marriage is in trouble is likewise diffused ; this fact should have been more obvious from the start , making them -lrb- especially stone and young wilson -rrb- more susceptible to dorff 's charismatic menace . ***** cold creek manor -lrb- -rrb- mike figgis ~ dennis quaid , sharon stone , stephen dorff , juliette lewis		5		0
if there is one prediction for 2011 that we can make at this point , it 's that hollywood is n't going to change . one glance at the current slate of movies scheduled for this year reveals a barrage of the usual suspects : remakes -lrb- fright night , conan the barbarian -rrb- , literary adaptations -lrb- jane eyre , one day , the help -rrb- , sequels/prequels -lrb- pirates of the caribbean 4 , harry potter 7 part 2 , transformers 3 , twilight 4 part 1 -rrb- and of course , that 21st-century tinseltown staple - the superhero movie . with marvel continuing to gear up for its 2012 avengers extravaganza with movies like thor and captain america and various other projects set to be released throughout the summer and fall , the green hornet should probably consider itself lucky to arrive first and ahead of what might prove to be an overdose of super come the end of the year . it 's not only its early release date that makes the green hornet stand out . what most attracted the attention -lrb- and , to be fair , skepticism -rrb- of the fanboy and film worlds was the involvement of seth rogen , as both the green hornet himself and as a co-writer , and of michael gondry , helmer of such off-beat fare as eternal sunshine of the spotless mind , the science of sleep and be kind rewind . it was an intriguing prospect , and the final product , though i wish gondry had incorporated more of his quirky , artsy sensibility , is n't half-bad . with a laid-back , tone and vaguely satirical intentions , the green hornet is more iron man than batman . the main draw , though , is the cast . our protagonist , britt reid , is n't your typical superhero or even your typical plain-old hero ; he 's an egomaniac , does n't have the brightest mind in the world and tells his father -lrb- played with a sort of resigned lethargy by tom wilkinson -rrb- that his ambitions amount to earning a degree from itt technical institute . with no real job in sight , at least not until the death of his father leaves him in charge of the newspaper the daily sentinel , britt spends most of his time partying and getting wasted , but seth rogen portrays him as such an earnest , well-intentioned schlub that , even if he is never quite endearing , we learn to tolerate the guy . i ca n't think of another actor that could have made the part work . as the perpetually insecure and slightly flamboyant chudnofsky , christoph waltz brings charisma and the constant hint of a smile to an otherwise throwaway villain , and edward furlong has a delightful , james cameo . cameron diaz is convincing enough as lenore case , britt 's new secretary and the unknowing `` mastermind '' behind the green hornet , but her character is so unsubstantial on paper that it 's easy to forget she even exists and to imagine the movie working well enough without her . the real star of the film , however , is jay chou 's kato , without whom rogen 's britt , and not to mention the movie itself , would be completely lost . already a superstar overseas , chou has an effortless cool that should easily win over american audiences as well . so , what is the green hornet actually about ? despite their persistent reputation as little more than for hollywood studios , most superhero movies actually revolve around some sort of deeper theme , whether it is a battle cry against homophobia -lrb- x-men -rrb- and weapons and war -lrb- iron man -rrb- or an exploration of the nature of vigilante justice -lrb- the batman movies , especially christopher nolan 's work -rrb- and teen angst -lrb- spider-man -rrb- . i 'm not at all familiar with the original green hornet radio series or any of the related mythology , but gondry , rogen and the other writers were probably aiming for something about journalistic integrity ; the phrase is even used once or twice in the movie . the plot arc is there -lrb- one of the antagonists is a d.a. who uses the sentinel to downplay crime in los angeles in order to make himself look good to the electorate -rrb- , but it somehow seems a bit hypocritical when britt basically uses his position at the newspaper to provide the hornet 's deeds with more publicity . the truth is , the green hornet is really a buddy comedy disguised as a superhero movie , a somewhat bromance with less raunch and more explosions . despite solid special effects and a fairly interesting , if not mind-blowing , action sequence -lrb- i refer to to the one where kato first unleashes his martial abilities -rrb- , the film is strongest when focusing on the banter between its two leads . when gondry turns toward the action in the final half hour or so , as if to remind us that this is , indeed , a superhero movie , the result is a climactic fight that is so over-the-top , it 's ludicrous , but not so ludicrous as to be particularly enjoyable or funny . in the end , thanks to the charm of its cast , especially jay chou , and the breezy script , the green hornet will most likely be one of the better offerings in the annual hollywood dumping ground known as january , and is worthwhile for those seeking a lighter alternative to the oscar-bait currently crowding the theaters .		5		0
whither megan fox ? my `` secret '' got out , and i feel like a guy who told the paper about his favorite lunch spot , only to have them run an article that drove so much business there that i ca n't even get a seat at my old table . fhm and maxim may have only gotten a clue this year , but they are n't the only two mags with `` top 100 '' lists . in 2005 , i compiled my own little list , and listed the megan fox that michael bay thought `` no one had ever heard of '' as # 2 on my list of `` top 100 sexiest famous women in america , '' which i published on my website . this was based on her super-sexy , and super-smart performance in confessions of a teenage drama queen . that the role left an impression on no one else did n't matter ; i 'm a guy , and know world-class sexy when i see it . did megan fox care that i ranked here there ? of course not . she did , however , hit up one of the big magazines ' parties , as a reward for their being three years behind the internet , and a list created specifically to `` scoop '' the `` big lists . '' mission accomplished on all counts . fast-forward to now , and everyone sees what i saw in 2005 . was megan fox ugly back then ? no . then why was she off these lists entirely ? the media just brainwashes men into confusing fame with being hot , and now she has both , so it 's easier to see her physical supremacy . i ca n't even fantasize about her anymore without feeling like the whole world is watching . tsk . for those who care , in 2005 the woman i ranked at # 1 was , a newcomer to all my children who is still going strong , and who is about as sexy as fox , but without the fame -lrb- yet -rrb- . i figure that scoop is forthcoming around 2012 . this is relevant to jennifer 's body because megan fox is still the * second * sexiest `` famous '' woman in america , and now she has made the * second * sexiest horror film ever . like fox herself was in 2005 , an unknown talent , in an unknown internet film , trumped this big-studio attempt at an `` mind-control '' horror film , in every category . the film is called `` . '' it can be found on the internet , from a producer named kismet . it contains genuine hypnosis , of an extremely sexy nature , with the lead actress using the exact `` bambi '' voice that fox spoke of using for her character , only to produce a much stronger -lrb- actual hypnosis -rrb- reaction in the viewer , if the viewer chooses to go under . the actress from , marta mcgonagle -lrb- now a rising star of her own -rrb- , is hotter than megan fox . her voice is sexier than megan fox , and she has even more of a `` supernatural power '' over men , like the one fox brags of . mcgonagle is superior to fox in every way , shape and form , but the two of them are superior to the rest of the world , by a much larger margin . -lrb- if you go under to it -rrb- is way superior to jennifer 's body -lrb- which is of the `` implied '' nature that hollywood loves to mail it in with -rrb- is less cerebral , with less of an impact on the viewer . the plots are not identical , but the psychological space in which the lead actress took herself in each film , is . that mcgonagle languishes in obscurity , while fox is '' # 1 sexy '' is a crime against nature . put her in any role claimed by fox , and she would do just as well , if not better . she 's just sexier , but , like fox in 2005 , unless she 's on the big media radar , the public will not become aware of her , and that 's sad . everything megan fox wishes she were , marta mcgonagle already is , just like fox was as hot , if not hotter , back in 2005 , than she is now . fox also thinks she is `` controversial , '' or `` cutting edge , '' but by internet standards , she has mainstreamed herself into a lame joke by comparison , one in which she has become her own punch line . fox herself is too busy for much of an internet presence , or maybe she knows that she 's not cut out for this jungle , where the pay is lower , the hours are longer , the work is more true to art than business , and where `` implied sexy '' no longer cuts it . if fox thinks her `` deadly bambi '' voice is seductively deadly , she should check out a copy of sometime . mcgonagle already ran for a touchdown with that ball , while fox barely made it to the market . here you have two actresses , with essentially the same looks , doing essentially the same things , and the same imbalance that plagues the entertainment industry as a whole , and will continue to do so until hollywood is finally done spending yesterday 's money , and goes broke , forcing its `` a-list '' to begin to seek work out here .		5		0
denzel washington plays boxer `` hurricane '' carter in this biopic about carter 's struggles with racist america even as he was ascending boxing 's pedestal . veteran norman jewison , no stranger to films about social outrage , and particularly to films about racism -lrb- `` in the heat of the night '' -rrb- , perhaps is a little too close to his subject matter , as the whole film is too preachy , earnest and self-congratulatory . washington gives a performance full of obvious conviction , but the film 's length and sheer eventually do him in . grade : c		5		0
according to my own unscientific survey , will ferrell is one of the more polarizing figures in comedy to come along recently . people either really like him or really detest him . not much middle ground . fortunately for ferrell , those in the former group make up sufficient numbers to have propelled him to the top of the comedy heap when it comes to profitable movies . i count myself among that group . having said that , ` step brothers ' is not one of his better efforts . teamed this time with john c. reilly , the film is deliberately profane and low-brow , so that 's not the problem . its main conceit , that the two are forty-year-old men who operate on the emotional level of thirteen-year-old spoiled brats , is not really adequate to carry the flick and comes perilously close to wearing out its welcome early on . but ` step brothers ' soon becomes more of an excuse for ferrell and reilly to riff off one another , like -lrb- dare i say ? -rrb- an extended saturday night live skit featuring their respective characters , brennan and dale . though the batting average for the various gags is not high , it is to the two comedians ' credit that they come up with enough funny stuff over the course of the film to keep us from becoming too critical and walking out of the theater . whether or not a lot of the material is improvised , i do n't know , but it feels like it is . the interaction between brennan and dale much of the time is like watching an episode of ` whose line is it anyway ? ' occasionally you think , these guys are good , and other times , they rate a groan . actually , richard jenkins , as dale 's put-upon father , steals many scenes with his frustrated , infuriated responses to the two overgrown kids ' mischievous and at times , near-fatal tomfoolery . he is crucial for the comedy to work as well as it does , and his dialogue is often the funniest , as when he listens to dale spew line after line of bs for what must be the thousandth time and then finally screams , `` would you shut the f *** up ! '' ` step brothers ' meanders along without much point , veering wildly between humorous scenes and ones that fall flat , reaching not so much a climax as a place where the filmmakers seemingly decided to just turn the cameras off . neither ferrell 's best nor worst , it 's an okay way to kill a couple of hours if you 're a fan . not much more than that , though .		5		0
greetings again from the darkness . bruce willis is cool and monica bellucci is beautiful . we did n't need a ludicrous script and millions of dollars in special effects to prove these points . i seemed to be one of the few who thought antoine fuqua 's direction was over the top in `` training day '' , but i am certain most will agree with me on this movie . unbelieveable story with loud bombs . by the way , why ca n't someone cast tom skerritt in a real movie ?		5		0
i love grease 2 ! going in to watching grease 2 and expecting to see a musical sequel live up to the strong likes of grease will certainly cause you to breakdown sobbing uncontrollably calling for your mommy all within a first few minutes of the film , but it 's really not , all that bad well ya it is but still , it 's a forgivable bad . grease 2 is very ingratiating , just like grease , but in a different vibe . the sequel just never has any chance at being as good as grease , but still grease 2 is such a guilty pleasure of mine . it 's really not that bad . it 's playful , very decent mild-mannered merriment . the songs are ... so worse than the songs of grease ... let 's not say that , let 's say they 're catchy good . i love the songs of grease 2 even though they 're not all that good , or on second thought , maybe they are good , i dunno , i do love them , i mean ... no ... no they 're definitely , definitely not that good . my favorite grease 2 tunes are `` back to school again '' , `` score tonight '' , and `` cool rider '' . i love , love , love michelle pfeiffer starring and singing and performing in grease 2 . without the worthwhile michelle pfeiffer there 's really no telling how bad it might have got . grease 2 is enjoyable at times though it is consistently bad , but it is n't too unsavory and it tries so good . it earns a good 5 rating wholly on its fun , lighthearted goodness , and for the presence of pfeiffer . if i love grease 2 this much , please understand just how much it is that i love grease ... . sooooooooo , so very much .		5		0
this movie is mainly for kids and adults that grew up watching the muppets . personally i did n't really grew up watching the muppets , watched it a few times but hardly any . but if you are one of the audiences that grew up watching the muppets than this will bring some laughter to some that has nostalgic memories of this show . the jokes and everything might be very childish and so very cheesy but it 's a kids movie . this movie is basically a musical with good amount of satire . now the music numbers are forgettable but is n't bad either but the satire in this is actually clever and pretty good . to the point it can lead to few chuckles or laughter . amy adams was the perfect choice in this , cause she is just really good in these types of cartoony musicals . where it blends non-living character with real people . she is n't in this as much though nor does she have a prominent role . jason segel is alright for this flick as well since he brings out the goofiness of his character without being serious . in fact most of the way through it seemed like the actor was trying to hold in his laughter in every scene . maybe he got the job in this cause he played the puppet guy in `` forgetting sarah marshall '' . overall if your a fan of the muppets or at least grew up watching it than you might have some few nostalgic times with this and it 's a alright flick to take the whole family . but it 's easily forgettable with a story that does n't really stick . 5/10		5		0
hype is the name of the game , and even the best of us sometimes fall for it ; i did , when i read the plethora of glowing reviews of this movie . did no one else notice the cheesy effects , the deadening performances , the often lackluster direction ... ? the movie has its moments , but mere moments do not a three hour film make . when it 's not dragging along like a crippled animal , it 's dashing headlong like a video game gone haywire . and that , i think , is the audience at which this one is aimed : the `` shut-in '' kids who spend most of their time -lrb- and tons of money -rrb- on video games and the ilk . certainly it 's not geared toward mature viewers , who quickly grow bored with the paper-thin plot -lrb- tolkein has never been mistaken for a writer of great literary worth -rrb- and the even thinner film-making sleight-of-hand that jackson employs . -lrb- i was genuinely shocked by some of the downright dunderheaded things the filmmakers tried to get away with when it came to fx - from incorrectly aligning composite images , to cheesy video game fx that never even come close to passing muster , to the use of what are quite clearly children in wide shots showing hobbits and humans and elves together . -rrb- i could go on , but there 's really no point : the film is a financial success , and that 's all that jackson and company are concerned about , anyway . -lrb- reminding me in that respect of ridley scott , a once promising director reduced now to making movies like the godawful hannibal , who boldly proclaimed in one nationally televised interview , that he no longer cared what anyone else thought of his films . -rrb- one would do well to remember one thing : even if a million people say a stupid thing , it is still a stupid thing .		5		0
after seeing the first pirates of the carribbean movie i was excited to see johnny depp repeat his performance in this second version of the movie . once again the writers of this second version fell flat on their face with the story . first off this movie was way to long running for two and a half hours . could have chopped off at least a half hour . the only thing positive about this overlong version was the special effects which were very good . johnny depp gave a very good performance as well as several members of the cast who i am not familiar with previously . your best best would be to watch the original version of pirates of the carribbean again and pass this one up . if you have to see it despite my warnings get the dvd and save yourself the price of admission .		5		0
in script terms this is just a big budget cliffhanger serial from the 1930s except for one important difference - sadistic violence . villains are burned , shot , crushed , melted and blown up . okay so most of them are comic book nazis so that makes it okay i guess . even so i do think the violence is way over the top especially the bit where the blood splashes all the over the plane . and correct me if i ` m wrong but isn ` t the legendary scene where indie shoots the arab swordsman been ripped off from the benny hill show ?		5		0
i saw angel eyes awhile ago , it was ok , definitely a serious type of movie and an unusual one and lopez does n't play her usual type of role . this movie , although it is well written and different , did n't do it for me at all though . jennifer lopez does do an ok job here , it 's not her usual fluff role and she proves she can actually act but i still just could n't get into this film . i felt it was to dreary , to plodding and as good as lopez was i never felt i was watching anything other then jennifer lopez portray a movie character . however , that being said , i can appreciate that it is a bit different and very well acted . the film is not what i 'd ever consider to be bad , and it was poignant and touching in many places and yes i shed a few tears so because of that i did rate it average . however , it just did not appeal to my personal tastes although some people may love it but was a good role for lopez , as she shows she has some talent with this movie . angel eyes was a very sad movie that most definitely is n't a fluff type of film and that i could appreciate even if it did not appeal to me personally . i did n't like it all that much but would recommend it to any fan of lopez who wants to see her in a more serious role .		5		0
angel eyes stars jenny from the block jennifer lopez , who plays a cop who was saved by a handsome man who falls in love with lopez 's charcther . his behavior is very strange around lopez 's charcther until she discovers that he is suffering from memory loss as his wife and child died in a terrible freak car accident a few years ago , and lopez thought he was dead . the acting is good , james caviezel is great , lopez is good too . the story is bit weird sometimes as it can get really confusing in a few places . bottom line : if you want a good j-lo movie watch maid in manhattan instead . 5.5 / 10		5		0
this is another comedy starring will ferrell , and certainly not one of his more popular ones . i believe i first saw `` kicking & screaming '' three years ago this month , which i guess was not long after it came into stores . i did not find it very funny or memorable , and probably did n't think about it much afterwards . i did n't see it again until last night -lrb- i could n't remember it very well beforehand , which does n't surprise me -rrb- , and while my tastes may have changed just slightly in the past three years , watching this comedy again definitely was n't much different from watching it the first time , if at all . phil weston was raised by a very athletic , competitive father , buck , but has never been very athletic himself . he now runs a vitamin store for a living , and is married to barbara , a woman he met in college . the couple have a 10-year-old son named sam , who seems to be taking after his father . buck coaches a soccer team called the gladiators , the best team in the league . his grandson is on this team , but is a . eventually , buck sends sam over to the tigers , currently the worst team in the league , and phil is not pleased . when it turns out that the coach for the tigers is gone , phil decides to take over , despite having no experience as a coach ! he manages to get former nfl player mike ditka to become his assistant coach , and does various things to try and make his team more successful , but his strategies may not be the right ones , and his highly competitive father continues to give him a hard time ! due to my indifference to most of this 2005 comedy , i ca n't point out too many gags that really stand out as good or bad . i guess one lame gag i can point out -lrb- though i 've seen worse -rrb- is the one early in the film where a player has a soccer ball stuffed in his shirt and is pretending to be pregnant . certain team members tend to bring some weak attempts at humour to the film . now , i definitely was occasionally amused , sometimes with ferrell 's antics , and some of the coffee gags involving his character . the part where i laughed the most was probably phil weston trying to get back into the coffee shop after getting kicked out . if only there were a good number of other gags that funny in the film , or close to it . that definitely would have made it a good comedy . unfortunately , that 's not the case , and since one would likely watch `` kicking & screaming '' for laughs , i guess it 's a failure .		5		0
the film got good reviews and i cant believe i watched it . the cast looked good but they were all given pathetic cameo 's . -lrb- except for , of course johnny depp -rrb- it started out all right with the mystery factor playing a big role . who did it ? why ? when ? what 's going to happen next ? etc. . but suddenly it was revealed and a silly ` se7en ' like film kicks in with the horse man killing people not randomly but specific people at specific times . hence , depp 's job becoming a lot more easier and the film getting way out of breath .		5		0
i did not like this film as there is no comical relationship as we saw in the television shows . tom wilkinson gives a wonderful performance as a mobster . his brooklyn accent is memorable . the beginning of the film was rather boring as we get into the story . nonetheless , the tragic death of our hero 's parents was vividly told . as the film progresses , there are some nicely done action sequences but the story is rather uneven . bring back the old television show . christian bale does an adequate job as our crime crusader . while he did have this terrible tragedy in his life , the human element in his performance is missing .		5		0
halloween 5 , yeah , this was a disappointment , most fans do n't really dig this sequel which is understandable . it is kind of stupid or just plain stupid ; this is the story that most horror movie sequels try to rip off , the telepathic powers that get really annoying . it seems like every horror movie sequel has to have it , friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street had it , why not include the halloween franchise as well ? unfortunately i did n't get into it , i think because it was extremely unoriginal and not to mention that the story did n't really continue from the 4th sequel . the ending of halloween 4 had jamie turning evil , i guess they just totally dropped that idea which could have been great to see , instead we got a silly and typical horror story that was badly acted , edited , and directed . michael myers makes his way into a small shack by the river owned by a local hermit . once there , michael collapses and remains in a comatose state for a full year . on october 30th michael awakens , kills the hermit , and returns to terrorize haddonfield , where his young niece , jamie lloyd continues to live after nearly being killed by michael the year before . jamie has been mute since attacking her foster mother at the end of film 4 , but exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her evil uncle . dr. sam loomis realizes that this link exists , and plans to use it to put an end to michael 's reign of terror . michael begins stalking rachel and her friend tina . after both are killed jamie agrees to put herself in danger to help loomis stop michael for good . with jamie 's help , loomis lures michael back to the old myers house . michael makes many attempts at killing jamie , finally getting the chance to in the attic . jamie tries appealing to michael 's humanity by calling him `` uncle '' . myers pauses , prompting jamie to ask to see his face . he takes off his mask , and a lone tear runs down his face . jamie reaches up to wipe it away , and michael is thrown into a rage . the killer pursues jamie , who runs into loomis . the doctor seems to turn on the girl as he shouts for michael to come and take her . it turns out that he has used the girl as bait , thus leading michael to walk beneath a heavy chain net . but you have to see what happens next by watching the movie . while granted that this movie is n't the worst movie in the world , i do enjoy the halloween sequels , i think this was a fall in the story line for the halloween series . it really could have had a lot of potential , but since they dropped a few ideas that were presented in the previous halloween sequel . not to mention this is one of the rare times that i was n't scared by michael , he 's loosing his touch ... no , i ca n't say that , please i ca n't say that ... it 's the writing ! it 's the blasted writing ! so if you wan na see the sequels , yeah , do watch it just to see the story continue , but if you are just looking for a scary movie in general , you can skip halloween 5 . 5/10		5		0
this film reminds me of `` the big sleep '' with bogie and bacall , although `` chinatown '' is more enjoyable than the 1946 so-called `` classic '' . both jake gittes and philip marlowe exude smugness and insolence ; both have to contend with , and are inexorably drawn to , classy women with secrets . and typical of movies that feature gumshoe detectives , the stories of both `` the big sleep '' and `` chinatown '' are confusing and convoluted . `` chinatown '' combines power and corruption with sex and murder into a needlessly complex plot , written perhaps deliberately to confound viewers , in keeping with traditional noir doctrine , which espouses that confusion equals arty sophistication . so who did kill ida sessions , and how did she get possession of those pictures ? fans of `` chinatown '' would regard such questions as irrelevant , just as fans of `` the big sleep '' would regard the question of who killed owen taylor irrelevant . who cares who the killer was , so long as you have the infallible nicholson , as heir to the infallible bogart , to distract attention from the story . sorry , but i just do n't agree that a muddled story can be a film 's virtue . `` chinatown '' does have its strengths . good acting permeates the film , even among minor characters . but the performance of john huston was inspired -lrb- pardon the irony -rrb- , and should have been recognized as such with an academy award . the music , too , is impressive . the slow , lonely horn evokes a dark and brooding mood totally in sync with the classy cinematography . this film has a haunting cinematic atmosphere and , to some extent , that helps overcome a perplexing plot .		5		0
i have n't seen too many of the hellraiser films ... i 've seen the first , which i thoroughly enjoyed as a gory horror flick , and i 've seen the second , which i found provided excellent comic relief , as everything was terribly overplayed and the poor script did n't help much either . so , i found this in blockbuster , at a cheap renting fee , so i thought , what the heck , it might be entertaining . that is n't far from the truth ... but why it is entertaining is possibly part of the problem with the film . i think it has a pretty good -lrb- no , scratch that ; a very good -rrb- premise ... but the execution is flawed . the plot is somewhat good , and the pacing is ok . the acting is pretty standard ... for a direct-to-video film . the special effects range , but are mostly fairly good . the gore is good , and some of the shocks work . but the film just suffers from so many problems ... the plot is a mess . i did n't manage to keep track of how many times the main character wakes up and realizes that it was a dream ... and the very ending ... well , yes , it does make sense , but it just seems so ... empty , somehow . the film is very low on actual scares . like the second one , it 's horribly overplayed and usually inspires laughter rather than fear . i kind of liked how the cenobites were played down in the story , like they were in the first one ... these are not main characters of the franchise , not at all . they are the most well-known , sure , but not the main characters . the film is more about the main character facing his own personal demons , with the cenobites being there to clarify this ... which is good . only , much like the second , the cenobites did n't really scare me ... they were seen too much , and did n't seem as powerful or terrifying as they did in the first . i liked how the film kind of was about this man finding himself in his own personal hell , but , once again , it just felt empty and wrong . there were far too many times where i found myself questioning the characters ' actions and not understanding what was going on or why ... not even after the film was over . in the end , you 're just left with that feeling of `` was that it ? '' and that 's really quite a loss , even for a direct-to-video production . i did find this to be an ok entry to the franchise , but it 's really only worth watching for those who want to see anything that has any relation to the hellraiser series . i recommend this only to big fans of hellraiser and fans of / horror films , and , be warned , you might not like it at all ... even if you are a very big fan of the franchise or of aforementioned genres . 5/10		5		0
everything about this movie is extremely average and the movie does n't feature one thing that has n't been done before . its extremely formulaic simple entertainment with a way too simple story and uninteresting characters . where did it went wrong ? simple , it went wrong from the moment they hired paul w.s. anderson . he has n't made one movie in his career that is interesting , original or simply above average . this movie really is no exception . it has a typical anderson style , meaning that it 's filled with flaws . but anderson is even worser as a writer , the story he wrote for this movie is incredibly simple and features awful dialog and dull characters . anderson 's directing is truly the weakest thing of the movie . his directing of the actors feels lacking , with as a result that the actors do n't have an awful lot to do in this movie and their performances come across as bad . even lance henriksen 's role . also the directing of the action sequences are seriously lacking . although some of the action does has its moments , it is badly filmed and horribly edited . halve of the time i could n't even exactly tell what was happening . the characters are completely uninteresting and of some you do n't even get to know their names . why should you even care for the characters in this movie ? none of them is likable or easy to relate with . also what was with the many accents in this movie ? it was quite irritating to be honest . but even worse were some of the sounds that the aliens and predators were making . the predators made the sounds of lions and the aliens that of elephants . it made me seriously laugh when i heard the queen alien trumpet . so thumbs down for the sound department as well . the movie is not as bad as i make it sound now maybe but it 's just that this was a movie with so much potential but somehow anderson turned it into the most formulaic and average movie possible . i mean when you have to concept of making the aliens fight the predators , then surely there is something better they could had come up with . the movie is slightly below average because of the extremely simple and uninteresting story and characters . still the special effects are good and some of the action is enjoyable enough to make this movie still a watchable one . 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/		5		0
i guess a good way for me to start off is by saying i am aware of the fact that this action movie is based on a video game . since i 've never been a video game buff , i 've never been familiar with the `` mortal kombat '' game . i do n't think i ever heard of this film before 2001 , when i first heard the soundtrack of its apparently inferior 1997 sequel , `` mortal kombat : annihilation '' . for a while , i knew about the two films without ever seeing them , but i recently came across a copy of this first one at the video store , in the action section , so i decided to rent it . after doing so , i do n't think i 'll ever watch the sequel , that 's for sure ! an ancient tournament called mortal kombat is held every generation . in each tournament , warriors from earth fight against warriors from outworld . the evil emperor of outworld plans to conquer earth , but in order to do so , outworld will have to win ten tournaments in a row . however , they have already won nine in a row , so earth must win the next one in order to save their planet ! on earth , lord rayden gathers a group of martial arts experts together ; sonya blade , liu kang , and johnny cage , who are all taken to the island where mortal kombat is about to take place , and where they will have to fight for earth ! with outworld very close to being able to conquer their world , the pressure is on ! this movie has a lot of action in it , you do n't have to worry about that , but action is n't everything . it does n't start very well at all with the dream sequence -lrb- showing a dream that liu kang has -rrb- , and personally , i found very little excitement in the film . it 's filled with mindless action , and not in a good way . i found most of the fight scenes simply boring , and sometimes found them unintentionally funny because they were so bad -lrb- a lot like certain power ranger battles , but maybe funnier -rrb- , but very rarely . i guess it could have been fun if the film had a lot more sequences like that . some scenes put a puzzled look on my face , though i ca n't remember which ones , which i guess shows how forgettable this film is -lrb- i certainly ca n't describe it as memorably bad -rrb- . after my experience watching `` mortal kombat '' , it is n't much other than mediocre and forgettable in my book . i 'm not sure whether being familiar with the video game would have effected my opinion on this film or not , but as a casual viewer , i have stated what i think . i feel that even 5/10 might be too generous . so , i think i 've made it obvious why i wo n't be watching `` mortal kombat : annihilation '' . sequels can usually be expected to be inferior to their predecessors , even if their predecessors are n't that good , so it 's no surprise that the `` mortal kombat '' sequel is generally regarded as inferior to this film , and is also generally regarded as very bad ! if you like electronic music -lrb- like techno -rrb- , then i 'm sure you would enjoy listening to the soundtracks for both movies , but unfortunately , this movie itself does n't have much entertainment value , and i 'm sure i can assume that 's the case with the sequel as well !		5		0
at st. john 's college , in a small snowy canadian town , all the male students are foaming at the mouth over a slew of spanking new blonde , buxom and beautiful party-hearty hotties over at the phil beta omega sorority house . unfortunately for them , the ladies actually turn out to be scaly alien creatures in disguise who thrive on cold temperatures and male dna , which they extract with blood-sucking tentacles that come out of their chests . as victims begin popping up -lrb- `` frozen from the inside out '' -rrb- , a freshman student -lrb- corey sevier -rrb- discovers their secret and must convince a disbelieving pair of detectives -lrb- richard burgi and nicole eggert -rrb- , his pretty tomboy friend -lrb- meghan ory -rrb- and his virginal roommate -lrb- elias toufexis -rrb- what 's really going on . their weakness is fire , which leads to a finale with our distraught hero raiding the sorority house and going on a flame-thrower rampage . decoys has a pretty entertaining and amusing first two-thirds , but it severely slips up near the end when it becomes a little more serious than its silly premise can believably accommodate . and there 's an irritating non-ending to contend with as well , but the special effects are passable , there are a few genuine laughs and the cast does a pretty good job . best of all is kim poirier , whom you may remember as the girl who got that nasty chainsaw death in the dawn of the dead remake . that film was n't much of a showcase for the actress , but here she gets the chance to shine playing one of the seductive aliens . just watching her go from an ice cream seductress to a more emotional being when she warms up to one of the guys , you can see she has enough range and sex appeal to go far in hollywood given the right breaks come her way . and though sevier overdoes it a bit near the end , he probably has a bright future ahead of himself , as well . apparently , this was a theatrical release in canada and a very limited big screen release in the u.s. before heading to video and the scifi channel .		5		0
ben wrightman -lrb- jimmy fallon -rrb- is an avid red sox fan who finds it hard to juggle his love of the sox with his love for his new girlfriend , lindsey -lrb- drew barrymore -rrb- . not a real complicated or intricate storyline , true . but the film is pretty good . granted , the chemistry between drew and fallon is n't particularly stellar -lrb- although serviceable enough -rrb- . the scenes with barrymore alone with her friends are pretty much useless and i probably would 've gotten so much more out of the film if i were a sox fan . but the film did turn out to be a lot better than i expected . do n't get me wrong it 's still my second least favorite farrelly brothers film -lrb- osmosis jones being the worst -rrb- , but i enjoyed it none the less . my grade : c + where i saw it : hbo on demand		5		0
the paperboy -lrb- 2012 -rrb- a rough and crude backwater view of louisiana folk and the crossing of paths of a convicted criminal and several local people with mixed pasts . it 's what a friend of mine would maybe call a swamp story -- and by that he meant all the messy , mired personal histories of a group of people getting in the way and making for high drama . in this case it becomes literally the swamps of the gulf coast and some pretty harrowing scenes result . the three leads are huge stars , and all are portrayed in a gritty , sometimes very unattractive way . nicole kidman plays a trashy rural woman well , coming on to those who ca n't resist and then getting in trouble -lrb- big trouble -rrb- with one of them . matthew mcconaughey is a troubled reporter and he ends up in worse shape than nicole kidman -lrb- partly because it takes longer to get him there -rrb- . and john cusack plays a convincing psycho criminal , released in time to make mayhem for the rest of the cast . -lrb- there is also an odd small role by david oyelowo , who has a voice so much like sidney poitier it 's surprising . -rrb- so this swamps story with a stellar cast seems to have potential , and it even is structured in an inventive way with a disjointed arranging of the narrative pieces , some shaky camera , and so on . but director -lrb- and screenwriter , and producer -rrb- lee daniels manages to make a muck of it all . the plot does n't seem terribly complicated but it 's weirdly hard to completely follow . the motivations of the characters -- from the writer to the woman to another younger man who has sexual needs that seem weirdly bottled up -- are never clarified . people act in disturbing ways and you 're curious as can be but you never quite know why things are happening , except maybe from cusak 's character since he 's supposed to be nuts and he acts it . you keep groping for sense to it , or at least artful non-sense , and it does n't gel . some of the dialog is forced , as well , so despite all the realistic grit you are thrust away from realism at the same time . i 'm guessing the book is terrific , because there is something great going on here behind all the broken parts . daniels is behind the disturbing but well made movie , `` precious , '' and so i expected something more together on this one . it 's as if he 's traded sensation for meaning , and for me it 's a false and frustrating trade .		5		0
brian spindler -lrb- paul walker -rrb- is an fbi agent investigating a series of hijackings by going undercover with a street gang led by dominic toretto -lrb- vin diesel -rrb- . caught up in toretto 's world of gang conflict that is resolved in late-night car races , spindler starts to sympathize with his suspect and falls in love with toretto 's sister mia -lrb- jordana brewster -rrb- . spindler initially suspects the wrong gang of complicity in the crimes he 's probing , while toretto remains involved in a forbidden romance , with his girlfriend letty -lrb- michelle rodriguez -rrb- . if you want to see a cool car movie , i would probably go with something other than this maybe gone in 60 seconds , vin diesel proves again he ca n't act . if you soup up honda accords or civic you probably own or talk all day about this film , if not this movie is pretty laughable with unrealistic racing and the `` vin diesel unscratched '' wreck was a joke .		5		0
movie about two pows -- major charles rane -lrb- william devane -rrb- and cpl. johnny vohden -lrb- tommy lee jones -rrb- -- returning home after many years away . both have trouble adjusting . then some vicious thugs kill devane 's wife and child ... and devane goes out for revenge . i realize this film has a cult following but i ca n't see why . the first half is pretty interesting showing devane having flashbacks to torture he endured and learning to deal with being home . then his family is killed and this turns into a standard revenge melodrama . all the subtlety in the first half goes out the window and it just becomes one fight or shootout after another . it all ends in a virtual bloodbath -lrb- that is n't that bad by today 's standards -rrb- . spoilers !!! at the end we see that jones seems to enjoy killing people . right there is that disturbing -lrb- and untrue -rrb- theory that all pows are unstable and just love killing people . end spoiler !!! acting does n't help . devane underplays this but way too much . you never see any of the emotions underneath that he should be feeling . jones is barely in it enough , and he is n't good . linda haynes plays a woman who goes along with devane -- she 's just terrible . even dabney coleman -lrb- in a small role -rrb- is lousy . so a potentially interesting idea is thrown away because of a lousy script and terrible acting . i give this a 5 because some of the action is n't bad .		5		0
while staying with a family in , mexico , in summer 1999 , i saw `` varsity blues '' in the local cinema . since i 'm totally numb to anything sports-related , i only half absorbed the movie -lrb- i spent most of the time reading the subtitles -rrb- . teenage boys are likely to only take interest in the whipped cream bikini scene . but i do know that in texas , football is king ; my mom had unpleasant experiences with that growing up in galena park , texas . obviously , the problem with calling it football is that we do n't play it with our feet ; that 's why most of the world calls `` football '' what we incomprehensibly call `` soccer '' . all in all , i 'll mainly remember james van der beek and ali larter for co-starring in `` jay and silent bob strike back '' .		5		0
there are many types of westerns ! `` seraphim falls '' falls into the revenge category ! we are witnesses to pierce brosnan being chased by liam neeson ! neeson wants revenge ! the viewers are kept in the dark until the end ! only then it gets clear what the deal is about ! what amazed me that pierce brosnan made very good use of his environment and knife ! his guerrilla tactics is n't something you expect to see in a western ! it could be that i am too old fashioned when it comes to this genre ! but i did miss the shootouts ! somehow a western without shooting is like a kung fu movie without martial arts ! at least that is what i expect ! i do n't like realism in this type of genre ! with shows like `` deadwood '' very little is left to the imagination ! experimenting and doing something new is always appreciated ! but is n't it possible to do so and still maintain some of the charm of the old westerns we all loved to see ! -lrb- movies like `` blueberry '' or `` the missing '' are examples of these movies which successfully added new elements to typical western movies ! -rrb- it is obvious that `` seraphim falls '' is n't your typical western ! this western is not an action movie but more a drama about two men dealing with their past and the consequences of their actions in the past ! personally i liked the ending very much ! i do have to say that this ending never would have worked if it were n't for the excellent performances by pierce brosnan and liam neeson ! brosnan has shown that he can do more than bond and similar roles ! he shows an intensity without using much words ! just brilliant ! the wonderful performances however ca n't hide the fact that the story is n't that special or interesting ! overall i have very mixed feelings about this movie !		5		0
w. lee wilder , brother of renowned `` some like it hot '' director billy wilder , directed the low-budget , science fiction fantasy `` phantom from space . '' this modest thriller spends most of its 73 minutes to the authorities as they try to corner a murderous alien from outer space clad in a helmet and suit . wilder and scribes william raynor and myles wilder adopt a `` dragnet '' documentary style with heavy reliance on narration and the constant reminder of the time and place of each scene to enhance its verisimilitude . wilder imitates special effects that the `` invisible man '' franchise used when the phantom dons his uniform and helmet . this is the kind of science fiction invasion epic where the alien attacks only when threatened . moreover , the alien can not speak english so nobody can understand his demands . `` phantom from space '' opens with a brief overview of the constant surveillance that our vigilant military maintains on land , at sea , and in the air . an unidentified flying object appears on radar around p.m. over point barrow , alaska . the u.f.o. hurdles southward at 5,000 miles per hour , but it gradually loses both speed and altitude . eventually , its vanishes off the radar in the vicinity of santa monica , california . no sooner has the ufo vanished from radar than people start complaining to the los angeles communications commission office about radio and television interference . the dispatches mobile units to deal with the complaints . lieutenant hazen -lrb- ted cooper of `` arizona manhunt '' -rrb- and his driver charlie -lrb- tom daly of `` mighty joe young '' -rrb- in mobile unit 1 encounter betty evans -lrb- one-time only actress lela nelson -rrb- near picnic grounds at the beach . she explains an individual in a deep-sea diving outfit and a helmet assaulted her husband ed and their friend pete . betty and pete knew each other because they attended school together . when the ambulance and the police arrive , they find betty 's husband ed dead and bandage pete 's head injury . later , when the police question him , pete tells inquisitive lieutenant bowers -lrb- harry landers of `` charro ! '' -rrb- : `` how would you feel if somebody with a helmet with crazy pipes sticking out of it came for you in the dark ? and look , i know this sounds -- sounds crazy , but there was no head in that helmet . '' during the interrogation , bowers receives news about another murder near the beach and leaves to investigate . a neighbor , george nelson -lrb- harry of `` detour '' -rrb- , tells bowers that he found the body after he experienced interference on his television . hazen rejoins charlie , and they keep tabs on the interference . they cruise out to the huntington beach oil fields . an explosion at the oil field facility claims the third victim . hazen catches up with bowers again . initially , bowers suspected both betty and pete may have killed her husband . however , he changes his mind when he believes a connection may lie between the interference and the homicides . a police sketch artist draws a picture of the mysterious killer that looks like the assailant that confronted betty and pete . an oil field facility night watchman -lrb- michael mark of `` jet pilot '' -rrb- verifies that the sketch resembles the individual he saw by a tank when it blew up . the central bureau in washington , d.c. , has bowers contact major andrews -lrb- james seay of `` vera cruz '' -rrb- and dr. wyatt -lrb- rudolph anders of `` magnificent obsession '' -rrb- at the griffith institute observatory . when andrews and wyatt examine the sketch , andrews believes the so-called `` phantom '' may be connected with an earlier u.f.o. sighting . andrews and wyatt express skepticism about the presence of an alien spaceship . furthermore , they rule out any possibility that the u.f.o. was either a missile or meteor because of its extreme speed and direction of travel . wyatt 's assistant , mrs. barbara randall -lrb- noreen nash of `` giant '' -rrb- , pokes her head to inform bowers that a newspaper reporter joe wakeman -lrb- jack daly of `` raintree county '' -rrb- wants to talk to him . bowers tells wakeman nothing that the reporter does n't already know . about 25 minutes into the action , the phantom -lrb- dick sands of `` casanova 's big night '' -rrb- makes his first appearance in his space outfit . andrews , wyatt , barbara , bowers , hazen , charlie and wakeman converge at a brickyard where they have located the phantom . they wield a geiger counter follow his trail of radiation . at one point , wakeman snaps a picture of the phantom before it enters a building and sheds his apparel . our heroes confiscate the phantom 's wardrobe and perform tests that surprise them . they struggle to cut , tear , and burn the suit without success . indeed , they discover the phantom 's outfit is magnetic . wyatt , andrews , and barbara figure out the phantom uses the suit to protect himself in the atmosphere beyond the earth . moreover , the helmet supplies the extraterrestrial with gases to breathe because he can not use oxygen . later , when barbara is by herself in the lab , the phantom enters and then locks the door . it taps out a code with a pair of scissors , but barbara does n't understand it . she does spot one of its huge footprints when it steps on powder . barbara 's husband bill arrives , can not open the door , but hears her voice . the phantom escapes from the lab with barbara . our heroes pursue it through the planetarium . the phantom returns to the lab and puts on the helmet to breathe . the others show up just as the phantom exits through a window . after the phantom 's departure , the space suit disintegrates . barbara discovers under ultraviolet light the phantom is visible . wyatt explains to bowers they are dealing with a super-human form based on the large size of the footprint , the sophisticated technology of the suit and helmet , and the creatures ' acumen . wyatt postulates the phantom must have entered the earth 's atmosphere accidentally . they chase it into the big space telescope chamber and watch it fall to the floor . before their eyes , the naked man turns to dust . `` phantom from space '' qualifies as a tolerable sci-fi film that audiences can skip without missing anything .		5		0
two 14th century former knights -lrb- nicolas cage and ron perlman -rrb- are asked to bring a suspected witch -lrb- claire foy -rrb- to a certain location so she can be tried for her crimes , for being a witch . but is she what she seems , and will they ever get her there , before it 's too late ? now i liked ghost rider -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , but compared too season of the witch does n't quite have the feeling of fun and adventure that ghost rider had . nicolas cage tries to hard to channel russell crow from gladiator -lrb- 2000 -rrb- , but in other scenes he was just being himself , it was not that great . claire foy was just not that impressive , but i hope she will do better . ron perlman is alright in this , he seems to bring it up a little . the effects are not that impressive , but there are some good scares , but other than that this movie was n't much of anything .		5		0
vince vaughn and paul giamatti star as a pair of different brothers in fred claus . this is director david dobkin 's first film since the hit wedding crashers . rated r . now he returns with fred claus , rated pg . now to me , something is wrong there . vince vaughn , the star of wedding crashers , old school , made , and others , stars in this film also . no , i ca n't do this . like if a sequel to a pg-13 film is rated pg , it 's doomed . fred claus , to me , seems on that familiar territory . trust me people this film is better than films like christmas with the kranks , but i think for a funny man like vince vaughn to be stooping to this level of humor just makes me say `` humbug '' . i know that line was cheesy , but i threw it in anyways . vaughn stars as the title role . he is santa 's brother . he lives in new york and has a girlfriend -lrb- rachael weiz ? -rrb- . for christmas one year , he decides to give his fat brother a visit . so , fred travels down to see his brother -lrb- paul giamatti -rrb- and wreaks havoc . santa also soon learns that they are going to shut down the north pole soon . you know it 's not like this is an awful film . i still believe that vince vaughn can make us laugh and he does a couple of times here . but it is sad to see him in pg films . kind of like in funny people when you see adam sandler 's character starring in merman . it 's sad . probably not that sad but it is a shame . this film , like evan almighty -lrb- though better -rrb- has pg rated humor . fred claus ai n't a disaster , but it ai n't art either .		5		0
you know the drill : witch puts death curse on princess , fairy softens it to sleep , and whole castle goes to sleep . as i learned in a fairy tale class in lewis & clark college just this past semester , some people think that the original fairy tale may have been about sexual maturation , the way she goes to sleep and wakes up a new person . certainly sleep is a period , providing an opportunity for rebirth , perhaps ? as for the spindle , that presents an interesting aspect : spinning was almost exclusively done by peasant women , so was it saying that if a princess tries to engage in it , strange things will happen ? does the curse mean that she 'll never be able to do work that women are supposed to do ? and the whole part about getting pricked by it : was that a sexual innuendo ? the whole part about the castle shutting down while she sleeps provides food for thought . while we were discussing `` sleeping beauty '' and its variants in the fairy tale class in early april , i noted that if an entire castle - or other such entity - had fallen asleep exactly one century earlier and just now woken up , they would have missed the entire 20th century -lrb- and specifically , they would have just missed the great san francisco earthquake -rrb- . so , everyone on earth would have to explain everything that happened throughout the 20th century and first few years of the 21st century -lrb- i would hope to be the one to explain popular culture -rrb- . i just imagine the people from the entity being all like : `` whoa . that was one weird century that we missed . so no one ever found jimmy hoffa ? '' what i 'd like to see happen when everyone goes to sleep is a `` psycho '' spoof . someone 's walking down the street , when suddenly , s/he feels tired . the `` psycho '' music starts playing . with his/her last bit of strength before dozing off , s/he grabs a towel , and pulls a bottle of red wine off of a counter . the bottle crashes to the ground and the wine runs down into a drain . back to the movie itself . there 's pretty much everything that we can expect in a disney version of a fairy tale : the virtuous princess is beautiful -lrb- or at least what our society considers beautiful -rrb- , the cool prince is one handsome dude , the evil witch wears all black -lrb- remember , this is before anyone thought about political correctness -rrb- and talks like endora on `` bewitched '' , the good fairies have the sort of relationship with each other than gilligan and the skipper have with each other , and the side characters exist mainly for comic relief . the movie really sets itself up to get mocked , and i threw out comments at it like mike , servo and crow do with the movies that dr. forrester sends them on `` mystery science theater 3000 '' . among my comments were : -lrb- when prince philip offers his horse extra oats and carrots -rrb- : `` bribery ?! duke cunningham went to jail for that ! '' * ; -lrb- when the good fairies are talking about how maleficent only understands hate and evil -rrb- : `` gee , maleficent sounds like the bush administration . '' the whole part about the fairies trying to live like `` mortals '' sounds so much like `` bewitched '' that it 's debatable whether that 's worth joking about . and when someone describes the 14th century as `` the present '' ... well , let 's just say that in the 14th century , i could n't have written this review because imdb.com did n't exist ! anyway , i guess that this is mainly worth seeing as a look at that era in cinema . i will admit that aurora is pretty hot . * in case you have n't been following the news , duke cunningham was a congressman -lrb- and jack crony -rrb- who recently got sent to jail for accepting bribes . when walt disney first released `` sleeping beauty '' , he probably never guessed that someone would review it and mention those creeps . but hey , this is the 21st century , so what this movie portrays becomes even more of a fantasy .		5		0
far be it from me to come down hard on an actor like pierce brosnan , who has made a career out of being suave and debonair , but that kind of characterization really can only carry an actor so far . this remake of the 1968 film that starred steve mcqueen is about a investment banker who happens to be an art thief . well , he 's struck again , and it 's up to the luscious rene russo -lrb- as an insurance investigator -rrb- to catch the thief . similarities to the more recent entrapment abound - in that one , sean connery was the suave rich fella with an eye for art , and catherine zeta-jones was the sexy insurance investigator . the problem with that film might have been the romance between zeta-jones and connery , who easily is old enough to be her grandfather . in this film , the two characters appear to rather close in age , so at least that quibble does n't exist . so let 's see what we have . we know right from the beginning that crown has stolen yet another priceless work of art , so that bit of suspense is gone . and we know that our friendly neighborhood insurance investigator -lrb- did you know they can be sexy , too ? who knew ? -rrb- will nab him not by catching him in the act but by - ahem - pretending to fall for him so she can learn his methods and turn him in as an insider . when you know your ` good guy ' is willing to risk it all to get her man , you know her credibility is shot . the chances of her keeping her head above water and not falling for him are incredibly slim , and we know that as the movie progresses we 'll see crown as less of a thief and more of a victim . ho-hum . now that i 've blasted the script , let 's look at the actors ' work . brosnan plays crown pretty much the way you 'd expect him to - aloof , cunning , intelligent - kind of like a james bond lite . he does n't bring a whole lot of excitement to the role , other than the fact that he 's pierce brosnan . as far as russo goes - well , she did several inexplicable gratuitous nude -lrb- topless , anyway -rrb- scenes in this film . now , sometimes gratuitous nudity is okay in my book - it can distract you from an otherwise dull film . but it seems to me the only reason russo - an accomplished actress - would consent to showing her breasts is to demonstrate she 's not bad-looking ... for a woman in her forties . other than for vanity reasons , there 's no reason in the world for her to get naked . -lrb- and for what it 's worth , i kind of wish catherine zeta-jones had done the same in entrapment ! -rrb- for me , this movie was n't even good as escapist fare . quite frankly , a suspense movie with no suspense has little going for it , although the lush production locations did ease the boredom a little .		5		0
because i said so turns out to be one of the most disappointing films of the year and it certainly does n't appear to be as bad as it is . in fact the trailer represents itself as an entertaining and enjoyable comedy with some strong female leads and some decent romance but in actuality the film is a complete mess !! i ca n't exactly pinpoint where they go wrong except a lot of the blame seems to rest on the shoulders of it 's star diane keaton . her performance is almost the biggest mess of the film but i 'll get to that later . the story itself is cute and some of the major players are worthwhile and enjoyable and any laughs that the film pulls off are entirely seen in the trailer ... a trait that is becoming more and more prominent in hollywood comedies . you ca n't truly laugh at something that you 've seen on television 90 times and when it comes up it 's just boring so there better be something else to support those moments and because i said so has none of that . diane keaton is no stranger to hollywood . she is considered hollywood elite and has been acting for three decades , four oscar nominations , and emmy nomination and nine golden globe nominations . so you 'd almost figure she 'd be the highlight but instead i truly believe she dragged this film even further through the mud . her wishy washy performance as overbearing mother daphne is a joke and not the good kind . she 's annoying and obnoxious and her character is meant to be lovably annoying but instead is just downright annoying . she is given some of the best lines and jokes from the film and you just do n't care at all . fortunately mandy moore truly tries to pick up the pieces but it 's just too late . moore plays the down on her luck in love daughter milly who goes from one bad relationship to the next despite her mother 's attempts to help her find the right man . moore is kind of typical to her roles , sweet , innocent , a little sassy but she shows more class and talent than anyone in the film . unfortunately for her performance the movie stinks . gabriel macht is moore 's love interest , the good guy , the stable guy but not her mother 's choice . macht and moore have terrific chemistry and this is great , strong leading man role for macht . tom everett scott plays the mother 's choice as rich , handsome , seemingly put together business-man jason who also happens to be the polar opposite of what moore 's character truly wants . the supporting cast is quite good and strong but barely noticeable , they are practically background props and used very , very little including lauren graham , and piper perabo as moore 's married sisters and stephen collins who plays keaton 's love interest unfortunately for him . long time director michael lehmann has no excuse for this film . it is just downright poorly put together . it appears that he let diane keaton run the script and she just does n't do it well . i am beginning to think her good performances are due to a good supporting cast and a good director . even the biggest fans of the ` chick flick ' will be bored to tears by this and there is n't much redeemable quality other than it 's watchable but you wo n't care a lick about any of the characters . it 's unfortunate because i think the script and story and some of the better actors in the film have a lot of potential but something seriously drags this one down . 5/10		5		0
`` death wish '' was a violent urban masterpiece , and , simply put , the most important vigilante film ever brought to screen . the first sequel was way more exploitative and sure no masterpiece , but definitely still a highly entertaining film that was not to be missed by any fan of charles bronson . after the ultra-violent `` death wish ii '' , the series becomes irrevocably absurd in `` death wish 3 '' . this second sequel , which does not at all bother about realism any more , introduces an arsenal of new , bigger weapons and has the death toll rise to enormous numbers . even though this third `` death wish '' film is extremely dumb and not nearly worthy of its predecessors , however , it still promises a very amusing time for my fellow fans of the great late charles bronson . this is the last `` death wish '' film directed by michael winner , and he sure is missed in the last two entries to the series . paul kersey -lrb- bronson -rrb- returns to new york city to meet an old army buddy , who is subsequently murdered by a gang of thugs -lrb- it had to be a friend this time , of course - it is not like kersey still has any surviving family members -rrb- . this , of course , makes good old paul get out his guns again , in order to follow his old habit of cleansing bad neighborhoods of thugs , this time of a huge gang of thugs . the film does n't focus on logic too much . kersey , who is , by the way , still the nicest guy in the world as long as he is not messed with , does n't even bother about cleansing the streets in secrecy any more - he just goes out and shoots evildoers in bright daylight -lrb- while the neighbors cheerfully watch -rrb- . the guns grow to the extreme -lrb- kersey even gets a rocket launcher via mail-order -rrb- , and the body count subsequently rises enormously . also , nobody seems to bother about paul 's vigilante activities any more - on the contrary , a police captain even requests him to take the law in his own hands ... `` death wish 3 '' is an incredibly stupid film , of course . all this film offers is extreme violence and charles bronson as paul kersey . but for me personally , that 's enough for a film to be highly entertaining . the only group of people i would recommend the film to are true charles bronson fans -lrb- like myself -rrb- . the two films to follow are simply bad , but this is still bad in a highly entertaining manner . `` death wish 3 '' is about as dumb as it gets , but hardcore fans of trash and/or charles bronson should still have a good time .		5		0

secret service veteran michael douglas -lrb- as pete garrison -rrb- once helped save president ronald reagan 's life , during a 1981 assassination attempt . presently , mr. douglas is one of the most trusted and respected agents assigned to protect the president . but , douglas is having an affair with the president 's wife , kim basinger -lrb- as sarah ballentine -rrb- . getting it on with the `` first lady '' results in deception showing up in a lie detector test douglas has to take , after the secret service discovers a `` mole '' within the organization . framed , douglas flees top investigator kiefer sutherland -lrb- as david breckinridge -rrb- and rookie hottie eva longoria -lrb- as jill marin -rrb- , while the real killers move to kill the president ... the questions douglas is asked , during his lie detector test , should have tipped him off ; they are phrased differently than those given to the other agents . there are a lot of moments when the plot falters , but director clark johnson and the cast keep convincing you to ... move along ... mr. johnson does an excellent job - and , he steps in front of the camera very effectively , as early victim `` charlie merriweather '' . it was nice to see martin donovan and blair brown in the supporting cast , reunited after working together on `` dark shadows '' . the cast , direction , and d.c. locations , keep `` the sentinel '' above average . ****** the sentinel -lrb- -rrb- clark johnson ~ michael douglas , kiefer sutherland , kim basinger		6		1
journalist mikael blomkvist -lrb- michael nyqvist -rrb- and hacker lisbeth salander -lrb- noomi rapace -rrb- return in this sequel to the girl with the dragon tattoo . as mikael and his journalists investigate a sex-trafficking ring , three people wind up dead , and lisbeth is accused of the murders -lrb- as her fingerprints are found on the weapon -rrb- . while mikael works to clear her name , lisbeth is on the run while seeking personal vengeance on the one -lrb- from her dark past -rrb- who framed her . this film is in many levels beneath the first film . the film continues where the girl with the dragon tattoo left off . it has been about two years since lisbeth and mikael parted ways . much of the first film 's strength derived from the chemistry between the leads . much of this film , however , has mikael and lisbeth working separately , each of them dealing with people in their own social circle . this causes the two characters to be reacquainted with their old flames . many side characters make an appearance , yet they are not expanded upon in great detail nor do they figure deeply into the plot . lisbeth 's lesbian scene with her ex-lover feels rather unnecessary and tacked-on . any romance that was built up between mikael and lisbeth in the first film is hardly mentioned this time around . majority of the film 's focus is on the unveiling of the details of lisbeth 's dark past , which ultimately leads to the person who framed her . the sex-trafficking plot is only touched upon . compared to its predecessor , this film is not as dark and serious , and it feels more cliché . the girl with the dragon tattoo was certainly more original , if hard to watch -lrb- review is here -rrb- . it was effective in atmosphere , in characterization , story , pacing , and how it engaged our sympathy and attention . with niels arden oplev 's taut direction , it was a stomach-churning thriller , particularly helped by the fact that we cared what happened to these characters . the plot was also engaging . this film 's pacing is uneven , many scenes feel tossed together , and the characters feel generic and simplified . while lisbeth is mainly focused on her vengeful quest , she lacks complexity -- the interesting elements are mostly when the film reiterates through flashbacks what we already knew from the first film . noomi rapace is still good in her role , making the most with her subtle expressions and movements . michael nyqvist as blomkvist is given little to do in the script , and is no longer the serious , driven journalist from the first film . he feels relegated to more of a side character type of role . it felt as if the filmmakers were merely capitalizing on the popularity of the first film and had decided to go into autopilot . some of the parts that do work are occasional fight scenes involving a tall , invincible , mute and blonde thug who is targeting lisbeth and the people around her . and , he can not feel any pain . yeah , he may be a cliché , but he 's still creepy . the eventual unveiling of the people of lisbeth 's past is also interesting and adds a bit of depth to lisbeth 's ongoing journey in the trilogy . as creepy as some of them may look , the bad guys in this film are painfully incompetent , robbing much of the thrills and intelligence from the film . one example is how the bad guys never make sure a protagonist is dead before he leaves -lrb- they make this mistake twice -rrb- . there is also a tiresome cliché in the film where the bad guy , after knocking the protagonists unconscious inside a barn , locks the door , soaks the place in oil , sets the whole barn on fire , and then walks away . now , would n't it have been much easier just to kill them while unconscious and not worry about possibly attracting attention by having a big ol' barn engulfed in flames , with orange smoke you can see from miles and miles away by the neighbors ? like clockwork , the protagonists do indeed escape through the back window -lrb- as they were n't tied up or anything -rrb- . overall , i found this film disappointing , given all the potential laid out by the first film . rife with clichés , this film was closer to an average b-movie . the plot did n't engage me because many side-plots were not effectively followed upon . the pacing was off , and dragging at times . new characters appear , but they do n't really contribute significantly to the story , and they 're soon gone . even some of the `` shocking '' plot twists feel like something from a soap opera . well , there 's another film after this one called the girl who kicked the hornet 's nest . perhaps it 's an improvement . as for the girl who played with fire , i give ** out of **** stars . for more of my recent reviews , you can also follow me on		6		1
on the cover of all the sell through dvd 's and video 's it has plastered all over the cover `` what you did n't see at the cinema '' '' unseen & explicit '' well after just watching this i am at a loss to as what they cut out when it was shown at the cinema . as far as adult humour goes road trip is quite tame compared to recent american college movies . that is not to say this film does not have any funny moment 's because it does . not enough for my liking . it has the usual college romp feel about it which is a shame because there are far to many of these type of films and i hope this is the last for a very long time . this stars tom green who is aparently the next big thing in the states . he obviously had an off day when he decided to star in road trip . not a bad film but we have seen it all before . 6 out of 10 .		6		1
as a surrealist , salvador dali naturally would want to have everything be weird . and luis bunuel was of course someone who sought to push the limits . you 'd better believe that `` un chien andalou '' -lrb- sometimes called `` an andalusian dog '' in the us -rrb- takes both to the nth degree . the whole movie is a litany of bizarre images without any dialog . the egg coming from the person 's eye was particularly far out . that said , i guess that we have to appreciate the movie for what it is . i will admit that i do n't know whether or not dali and bunuel wanted to make a point with `` un chien andalou '' -lrb- i mean , what would be the point of all that stuff in the movie ? -rrb- . but if absolutely nothing else , they made quite an art movie . maybe if we find the movie repulsive , we can still admire the artistic qualities .		6		1
this film sits firmly in the `` blockbuster '' category . as such you can more or less guarantee a stupid plot , dodgy script , loads of cgi and stereo-typical characters . the day after tomorrow certainly does n't break the mould on these terms , but it is above average for the following reasons . the subject matter here is actually quite interesting and whilst the causes of the life changing events are never any more than brushed over , at least they are aired . the ending is as upbeat as it could be , but you know everyone is in for a tough life after this . it 's not likely we 'll get a sequel to this . global warming is about to make the biggest storm -lrb- s - 3 -rrb- of our time . paradoxically this shuts down the gulf stream and eventually plunges earth into a sudden ice age . the film follows the path of the storm and watches a few poor mortals trying to survive . the characters all play a secondary role to the effects , but the actors make the most of their roles . warning : plot -lrb- ? -rrb- spoilers it 's quite interesting to see just how thoughtless the plot can be . after new york is flooded a large ship is seen navigating the skyscrapers before surprisingly running aground - quite why is never explained . the reason is finally revealed much later - it 's to make for an exciting scene later in the movie . plot spoilers over let 's be honest we go to see films like this for thrills and spills . the day after tomorrow certainly delivers and is better than most of it 's counterparts . 7/10 .		6		1
the cia man , brand hauser , is a man of few words and a lot of action . he is seen as the story begins going into a saloon in a remote alaskan post . we are not prepared for what he does after a shot of tabasco sauce ! hauser , who pilots his own private jet , has deep conversations with someone through a device in the panel of the plane . he even gets to talk to the us vice-president , who talks from the privacy of his own bathroom while engaging in some bodily functions . this political satire makes fun of the folly of the war on by placing the action in the middle of the conflict , where hauser goes to take part in a trade fair sponsor by the powerful tamerlane corporation . on his arrival in the country , hauser is assisted by the media expert , marsha dillon . the agent has been sent to take care of oil minister omar sharif who dares to think he can get an oil pipe line through the country , something that clashes with the group 's interests in the country . directed by joshua seftel , who has worked on television , and based on the screenplay in which the star of the film , john cusack helped produce , `` war , inc '' deals with issues and scandals too many to go into detail . suffice it to say that no one is spared at all . parallels with the present conflict in iraq and afghanistan are clearly what the creators intended all along , something the last administration probably did n't appreciate , or even vice-president cheney . mr. seftel has some success in presenting a chaotic situation in a satiric way . john cusack is all over the film . he makes a case for his brand hauser . marisa tomei plays a leftist oriented journalist that has come to cover the war and has too many questions that go unanswered . joan cusack is also on hand to give one of her usual funny performances . the surprise is hillary duff , who goes almost unrecognized . ben kingsley is also seen in a pivotal role . credit must go to john cusack by daring to do the impossible with a subject that not many would have touch with a ten foot pole .		6		1
single mom in southern california is repeatedly attacked by a violent sexual predator -- one who is a poltergeist . frank de felitta adapted his own bestseller , allegedly based on a true account , which has pedantic medical diagnoses in the first-half and monster-movie overtones in the second . barbara hershey , lovely and like an elfin flower-child , takes on the difficult leading role with casual detachment ; her delicacy is welcomed actually , as a role -lrb- and a movie -rrb- such as this can really go overboard without much effort . the script is a big handicap because the dialogue is n't as smart as the characters or the actors , and when hershey is asked at key moments to describe her circumstances , she suddenly starts babbling like maybe she really does need a team of doctors . the effects are iffy too -lrb- particularly the ones involving a nude body , which does n't quite convince -rrb- . however , the intensity of the situation and sidney j. furie 's tricky direction provide both suspense and morbid amusement , and the film 's bombastic finale is tolerable only because the plot really had no place else to go . ** 1/2 from ****		6		1
wallace & gromit has always been the phenomenon that eluded me . every once in awhile i would be flipping channels and come across a short on bbc , but never took the time to actually watch one completely . when the film came out last year it seemed cute enough , however , the lauded praise and fanfare was surprising to me , as well as the oscar -lrb- granted pixar was mia in 2005 -rrb- . finally i was able to catch up with the animated feature and upon completion i must say first impressions were correct . wallace & gromit in the curse of the were-rabbit is an enjoyable little film that does n't break any ground in storytelling , but is a feat of construction . unfortunately in this case the wonderful visuals ca n't overcome a lackluster plot . aardman definitely has inventive minds at work for them . the characters are all well fleshed out and nicely orchestrated . each voice is original and cartoony in a good way . almost like a vaudeville performance , the script is read articulately and showy . even the name actors like ralph fiennes and helena bonham carter are unrecognizable in their roles . this performance style helps greatly in creating the atmosphere desired with the movie . the animation is a big factor as well with facial features becoming distorted for every emotion . just the ability to have gromit the dog be articulate and understandable in stop motion animation , while never uttering a sound , is amazing . craftsmanship astounds at every turn . where the film falls flat is in the material being portrayed . the allusions are amusing with references to beauty and the beast and frankenstein , among many others , yet the gleaning from other sources soon becomes a bit tedious to the point where you know where the story is headed . with a plot progression as telegraphed as this one , i started to feel a bit restless as the really funny parts became too staggered to keep my interest . yes the visual puns are great most times , -lrb- the angel wings and devil horns in the meeting scene -rrb- , the hidden text a delight , -lrb- the car 's window sticker , the cheese box label , the radio buttons -rrb- , however , the sexual innuendoes got old and finally just elicited groans rather than chuckles . i almost feel the film would have been more successful either by going full-blown british and adult , or strictly without the crassness . instead i feel the brilliant artistic merits are overshadowed by a mixed bag of gags and confused overall feel that never finds its way . perhaps the switch to feature length created a need for filler in its almost 90 minute runtime , and hopefully when i get a chance to check out the shorts i will experience a tighter storyline and more enjoyable pieces of work .		6		1
soldier is a 1998 science film directed by paul w.s. anderson . soldier was written by david peoples , who co-wrote the script for blade runner . by his own admission , he considers soldier to be a `` '' / spiritual successor to blade runner . there are a lot of easter eggs in the movie , homing tribute to blade runner . it also obliquely references various elements of stories written by philip k. dick -lrb- who wrote the novel `` do androids dream of electric sheep ? '' , on which blade runner is based -rrb- , or film adaptations thereof . the film stars kurt russell as sgt. todd , a soldier trained from birth . the film also features gary busey , jason scott lee , jason isaacs , connie nielsen , sean pertwee and michael chiklis in supporting roles . in a futuristic society , some people are selected at birth to become soldiers , and trained in such a manner that they become inhuman killing machines . one of the best of these soldiers -lrb- russell -rrb- gets pitted against a new breed of soldiers , and after the confrontation is believed to be dead . his body is left behind in a colonial planet , where everything is peaceful , and he is taught about the other aspects of life . but eventually he has to fight the new breed of soldiers again , this time to defend his new home . ` soldier ' definitely has a lot going for it , an interesting take on the future of warfare , a solid cast led by kurt russell , above average artistic vision , memorable lines , and well thought out action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat . personally , kurt russell s performance as sgt. todd is just not that because you were born and bred to be a soldier does n't mean you are going to walk around like a terminator shooting everyone instead of hiding and ducking behind cover like any rational human . it 's hard to sympathize with a ruthless killer , just because he gets replaced by better killers ? he slowly becomes more human as the film goes along when he finally somewhat gains a family in a community . then the corporation hunting down towns attacks and he decides to defend it and get even . still not strong enough , as it 's clearly hard to figure out his humanity . it felt like one dimensional acting , yes i know he was made with one purpose , to be soldier . so yeah he 's supposed to be a one dimensional guy . in this movie obviously it requires minimal dialogue -- for such character . as the movie progresses and he spends more time with the family he shows more feelings and emotions -- but still kurt russell 's character is like a bored dog staring at you when it 's not biting the mailman . the main premise of this movie is that old sun tzu saying -lrb- -rrb- `` one man defending his family is worth 10 hired men attacking him '' . todd is a better warrior because he gets something worth fighting for . nice visuals and stuff as there were some weak cg in a couple scenes . the movie did a fine job of raising important questions . example : if you are n't fighting to protect civilians , what is your purpose ? it brings into focus the whole issue of a state versus its citizenry , possibly the dominant problem of the 21st century . then there is the ethical issue of tampering with nature . sociopaths always think they can get their way if they just find more sophisticated ways of manipulating the world around them . the outcome is always disastrous . how could you even use that sentence in the context of this movie ? why ? it 's got a great story , some solid acting , awesome characters , and just the right amount of action and story . check out soldier .		6		1
i 've probably seen `` paranormal activity '' too late . by the time the movie finally arrived in austria it had already been hyped up for years . yes , years . had already raved about this before the movie was picked up by a major studio and found a worldwide release . so , i had high expectations , but soon enough the backlash started and a lot of people pointed out that `` paranormal activity '' is n't the great , it had been made out to be at first . the truth is somewhere in the middle . for the low budget he had to work with director oren peli has made a highly atmospheric movie that does n't need the help of a score or cheap scares to work . the horror happens in the viewer 's mind , as they say . this is basically `` the haunting '' remade with the looks of `` blair witch project '' . of course , this also means that the movie is n't for everyone - myself included , because really nothing much happens : most of the time there are noises in the house and we watch the main characters freaking out about it . this may be scary if you 're having a lot of fantasy and not much experience watching horror movies . however , if you 've seen anything this side of `` cannibal holocaust '' and '' à '' , `` paranormal activity '' just does n't really do it for you . it 's not a bad movie by any means . it 's just nothing special -lrb- except , of course , for its spectacular revenue , but that 's information only movie studio bosses should be interested in , right ? -rrb- . one last piece of advice : contrary to common belief that this movie works best at the cinema , i have to say , in hindsight i wish i had seen it at home . this is where the horror in the movie takes place . watching it alone in your apartment at night probably helps to freak you out more than being in a public place with screaming teens .		6		1
i wish imdb would have let my summary line be my entire review . will gives basically a solo performance & he does reasonably well ; he is that good an actor . this is the 3rd version of this price & charlton heston were the stars of the first 2 version , i did not see either one . as i have stated prior i am not much of a science fiction fan , i definitely am not a zombie fan . as per above , i am a will smith fan . he is a first rate actor & like most comics , he can do drama with the very , he is ok in this solo role . the sets are first rate , the entire production is first rate , i just found the movie to be a bore . i think i have 10 lines now , ratings : ** 1/2 -lrb- out of 40 68 points -lrb- out of 100 -rrb- imdb 6 -lrb- out of 10 -rrb-		6		1
** spoilers ** with a strong earthquake erupting under the salton sea in southern california it opened up a hole where there were some prehistoric giant sleeping mollusks . the mollusks not only came back to life but started killing and eating a number of people and cattle in and around the sea . they then start laying eggs to bring and replenish their extinct species back to the point that they 'll overflow the inland salton sea and work their way into all the waterways and oceans of the earth . eating everything , man animal fish plant insect , on the planet into extinction . the us navy having a top secret base on the southern tip of the salton sea and experimenting with atomic energy has a lot of explaining to do to the american people in the fact that the mollusks are now a danger to the nation , as well as the very earth itself . the navy had been fooling around with nuclear fission in and around the sea that caused , together with the earthquake , the mollusks to grow to such enormous sizes and breed like a bunch of sex starved rabbits . after losing a number of navy men and some civilians along the sea the navy goes out on a hunting trip to find these killer mollusks . it soon confronts a number of them ending up capturing an unhatched egg of the creatures . with the commander of the naval base john `` twill '' twillinger , tim holt , in charge together with the head scientist dr. jess rogers , hans conried , they place the egg in a temperature controlled tank at 38 degrees to keep the egg from hatching . the up-tight and by-the-books commander twillinger get very friendly with one of the young women at the base secretary gail mackenzie , andrey dalton . thats after finding here cute but somewhat bratty little daughter sandy , mimi gibson , lost lady bug which leads to twillinger finding an opening to gail 's heart . it turns that gale lost her husband in a tragic naval accident two years ago . twillinger takes gale out to dinner where he spends more time looking at her then eating his meal . meanwhile the deadly and giant mollusks begin to fan out of the salton sea and move into a nearby canal . killing and eating everything in their path including , in the most jarring scene in the film , an old and cranky canal lock operator , ralph moody . who thought the story about these `` monsters from the deep '' , that the salton sea naval station warned him about , was all a joke until he himself got swallowed by one of them . the navy tracks down where the mollusks are and where their laying their eggs and with twillinger and dr. tad johns , max , donning naval scuba outfits they both go underwater and plant explosives in the mollusks breeding grounds ; thus blasting them and their eggs to pieces . what twillinger and the navy forgot was that back at the naval stations laboratory there was still an unhatched giant mollusk egg and little sandy , being there with her mom gail , decided to heat up the place by raising the temperature level of the water . that caused the mollusk to hatch and go on a wild rampage . exciting and nail-biting final with commander twillinger , or `` twill '' to his friends , coming to the rescue of gail and sandy who both locked themselves up in a side room to escape the crazed mutation . twillinger single-handedly holds off the mad and surging mollusk with a fire extinguisher and then steam hose until the troops finally arrive blasting the slimy thing right back into the stone age .		6		1
i came out of pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest with an empty feeling . it leaves on a major cliffhanger , and instead of feeling excited and anxious to see what happens next , like one usually feels with cliffhangers , i felt completely ripped off . i felt like i 've seen half a movie . now , it 's not exactly a new trend for guaranteed hit sequels to be filmed simultaneously to create some hackneyed `` trilogy , '' but dead man 's chest has got to be the absolute worst example of this method to date . it is all set-up and no payoff whatsoever . we learn so little about the characters that we do n't already know . it hints towards an attraction between elizabeth and jack , it presents a relationship between will and his dad , and in what is probably the only significantly developed character , norrington , who was once engaged to elizabeth , has now fallen hard on his luck , become embittered , and resorted to the ways of the pirate . the plot , among many aspects , mainly involves the pursuit of the dead man 's chest , hence the title . they find the damn thing but nothing really develops after that . i guess we have to find out what happens in the next one . great . what sours me on this movie is that it accomplishes literally nothing . there are no resolutions , just bigger and badder problems that occur . the matrix reloaded at least had its own small plot inside its larger plot about keanu reeves ' character dealing with premonitions of his loved one dying and finally having to face it , and back to the future part ii dealt with problems being solved in the future , past , and alternate universes that finally led to one one final time-travel accident that bridged into the concept of the sequel , etc. etc. . so what was dead man 's chest ? jack is stupid and he has to pay for it ? dead man 's chest has the action scenes that run way too long and the usual hijinks of the beloved character , jack sparrow . what i do really like about this series is that the main characters are n't growing to be best buddies or anything . usually in the first film the characters conflict and get on each others ' nerves but by part 2 they 're great friends -lrb- a la star wars -rrb- , but it is not so with this trio , mainly because of the unreliability of jack . they are basically only friends when it is convenient for him . the movie ends with jack `` dying '' and will and elizabeth , along with jack 's crew , mourning him and setting off to find a way to get him back . but , it really would n't surprise me if once they do save him in part 3 , he 'll find some way or another to screw them over . particularly will . i had no respect for the movie but i 'll admit it had its fun moments and i thought the visual effects were amazing . davy jones -lrb- played style by bill nighy -rrb- is a really cool creation . jones and his crew were apparently all cgi , but this was not one of those cases where you role your eyes and think it 's so obviously fake . this time , in this movie , i really bought it . so , what can i really say to sum up dead man 's chest ? i think it 's shameless . and when you think about it , it is exactly - exactly - like a ride in disneyland . you wait so long in the line -lrb- or in this case waiting for the movie to come out -rrb- , you finally get into it , and by the time it 's all over you feel empty and ripped off and need more of it . so , you have to ride it again -lrb- or see what happens in part 3 -rrb- , and you have to wait even longer . terrible ! i would say that on the whole , pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest is an okay movie that pales in comparison to the first . johnny depp was great , the action scenes were sometimes fun , and the visual effects were top-of-the-line and probably the highlight of the movie for me . it deserves a slap in the face for its script and plot , but an oscar for its effects . my rating : 6/10		6		1
following in the aftermath of king kong 's destruction and ultimate demise , carl denham is having serious legal and financial troubles , so decides to leave new york with captain englehorn on his ship . while in a foreign port , they pick up a beautiful actress and a shady seaman who has lost his ship and who tells them about treasure on skull island . but a mutiny occurs and denham , englehorn , hilda , helstrom and charlie the cook are stranded on skull island where they befriend another giant albino son of king kong . son of kong is a much lighter hearted and comedic movie than was its predecessor . it also is not on the same scale . nevertheless , it is an entertaining movie with a good cast , especially helen mack as hilda . the animation of little kong is not as good as that in king kong , but is still passable and the story moves along at a good pace with a reasonable plot . son of kong is not as great as king kong , but it is a good fun movie -lrb- with a few sadder and darker moments -rrb- that can be re-watched with some popcorn if you do n't want something too serious .		6		1
dante 's peak is a little unknown , very fine film . pierce brosnan is dr. harry dalton , a volcanologist with the u.s. geological survey , who 's sent to the small town in washington within the northern cascades named dante 's peak , the second most desirable place to live in the united states population under 20,000 , to check on a long time dormant volcano that 's about to erupt . linda hamilton is rachel wando , the mayor of dante 's peak , who 's taken with dr. dalton and keeps close by . hamilton and brosnan have very interesting , very authentic chemistry that makes dante 's peak more than worth while . brosnan and hamilton is the movie 's main sight , while the volcano of dante 's peak is the movie 's main attraction . the ever-present brewing volcano provides the ominous backdrop to the storyline implanting constant tension . there 's no action or effects until the volcano erupts , but when it does , there 's loads of it . dante 's peak turns into an all out action-adventure with great set effects for large scale destruction . the presentation of the special effects is very well done . the movie is good before the volcano erupts still , by having a nice , hang around vibe and pace , good not to rush things . dante 's peak 's prolonged pace is difficult to achieve , but it is executed well . the film does a solid job of incorporating the characters onto the viewing . dante 's peak has good camera direction from the start up and through to the action-packed finish that makes for an overall great visual experience . it 's a well-framed story . i do n't know what all else to say other than this is a really liked film without too many complaints . i give dante 's peak a 6 for it being so greatly appealing and such fine , family fun . i can enjoy this movie dearly again and again every so many years . i like volcano more , from the same year , but dante 's peak is a better movie .		6		1
outside of film geekdom , this is probably hitchcock 's most famous movie after psycho , with the effective and chilling thought of birds going on the attack seeming to resonate with the everyman . hedren plays melanie daniels , an ` it ' girl of the 60 's , who bumps into a lawyer , mitch brenner -lrb- taylor -rrb- , whilst in a pet shop purchasing a bird . the lawyer goads her for her lifestyle and , furious , she tracks him down to a small town called bodega bay where she intends to trick him , though it is clear that she is really romantically interested in the fellow , the sly old dog . once there , suddenly , mysteriously , the birds begin to act aggressively , starting with a solo dive onto miss daniels , and culminating in a full scale assault on the town . the birds attack in waves , then retreat , regroup , before attacking again . will miss daniels and co. get out alive ? and has the behaviour spread across the country or even the world ? and why does mitch brenner 's mother look so much like his new girlfriend ? you 'll have to watch to find out . not as intelligent as hitchcock 's finest offerings , this is still an effective thriller cum horror . ahead of its time in terms of ambition -lrb- i.e. the effects are not very convincing , though top marks for trying -rrb- this is still a taut affair , with some surprisingly savage bird attack scenes . it drags like a mother at times though , with the opening preamble seeming to go on for an eternity before the movies ' main play kicks in . interesting , if not essential viewing .		6		1
` wrong turn 4 : bloody beginnings ' : three stars -lrb- out of five -rrb- this fourth film in the ` wrong turn ' b movie slasher film franchise is a prequel , to the others , and i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by it ! i had extremely low expectations for this film considering it 's the fourth film in a horror movie franchise that was n't that great to begin with and was depreciating in quality and entertainment value with each installment -lrb- greatly -rrb- . the film was also written and directed by declan o'brien , who also directed the third film in the series as well -lrb- he also helmed the syfy network original ` sharktopus ' , which was , although bad , better than most syfy network films -rrb- and i thought ` wrong turn 3 : left for dead ' was just bad . it 's also a direct to video sequel -lrb- like all the other sequels -rrb- , so of course expectations are going to be low , but because my expectations were so low i actually really enjoyed it . it 's better than the other two sequels and while it might not be as good as the original it is in the same league . it 's one of those nasty horror films that just takes pride in being nasty ; it 's good at everything people that hate slasher films hate slasher films for ! the film tells the origins of the three villainous cannibals from the other films : one eye -lrb- daniel skene -rrb- , three finger -lrb- sean skene , who also plays a young college victim in the film named vincent -rrb- and saw tooth -lrb- scott johnson -rrb- . it begins in 1974 when they broke out of a psychiatric hospital as youths while killing the doctors and orderly and freeing all the other patients . the film then fast forwards several years to presumably present day -lrb- but prior to the other three films , which began in 2003 -rrb- when the three lunatics terrorize vacationing college kids snowboarding in the area , that made a wrong turn , and ended up at the abandoned sanatorium . we never learn what happened to the other escaped patients and learn very little about the cannibals ' new victims -lrb- other than that they like to party , have sex and do unimaginably stupid things -rrb- . the film is full of bad dialogue , bad acting and implausible situations . the characters all constantly make the dumbest decisions that you almost ca n't continue to root for them and you can almost predict what 's going to happen to them every step of the way . but the film does have great gore , great atmosphere and some pretty creepy imagery . it has so much fun reveling in it 's uncontrollable horror joy that that joy and fun almost has to translate to the viewer -lrb- if you enjoy that sort of thing -rrb- . it is so bad it 's good but the actors all look beautiful and the directing is n't bad . the story , character development and dialogue are all idiotic but that 's a big part of the fun . not a bad little horror film for it 's type and definitely better than the previous sequels ! watch our movie review show ` movie talk ' at :		6		1
professor deemer -lrb- leo g. carrol -rrb- and two of his colleagues have holed up in a lab out in the desert where they are experimenting with a new nutrient that will feed the world as its population explodes . the experiment goes awry -- do n't they all ? -- and deemer 's colleagues both contract a fulminating pituitary disorder , acromegalia , that distorts their features and then kills them . before he dies , enraged , one of the colleagues gives the unconscious professor deemer a shot of his own medicine . when the corpses begin to show up , the small-town doctor , john agar , is prompted to visit the lab out of curiosity . it is about this same time that carrol 's beautiful young assistant , mara corday , arrives . the young doc and the lab assistant fall for each other . this nutrient -- i hope you 're following this -- this nutrient promotes dramatic growth in organisms . in one day a baby rat is the size of a bunny rabbit . imagine what this will do for the world 's cattle supply ! one cow would fill up the barn and eat nothing but this nutrient fluid ! oh , by the way , the professor 's prediction about population growth was a little off the mark . he predicted that by 2000 the planet would be host to something more than three and a half billion people . it 's now 2007 and we are just shy of six billion . the best estimate is that in another 50 years we 'll have doubled that figure . someone place a long-distance call to thomas malthus and tell him he was right after all . well , see , most of the experimental organisms were destroyed in a fire , but one managed to escape . it could have been a guinea pig but if it had , there would be no picture . no -- it was a tarantula the size of a foot stool . the wretched thing hobbles about secretly in the desert , making a nuisance of itself by eating cattle , horses , and people . before you know it -- and , more important , before agar , corday , the local sheriff , and the us air force know it , the spider is the size of shea stadium and is crunching whole houses beneath it . -lrb- the now gruesomely disfigured professor is hoist by his own petard . -rrb- tommy guns do n't stop it . it does n't even pause when a load of dynamite is exploded under its . only an infallible super hero could save us now . and here he comes . clint eastwood , leading a pack of jets , demolishes the lumbering creature just as it is about to attack the town of desert rock . well , we knew mara corday would survive anyway , because she was later to appear in `` sudden impact '' with clint , many years later , as a waitress . the movie is made on a low budget and it has no ambitions beyond inspiring fear and wonder at the special effects , which look a bit shoddy to today 's audiences used to cgis . it has no lesson to teach us , unlike , say , `` the day the earth stood still , '' but its very cheesiness lends it a charm that 's lacking in multimillion-dollar f/x extravaganzas like `` the war of the worlds . '' it 's comforting to see a small-town doctor who makes house calls . the vistas of empty desert enchant the eye . and if the characters are stereotypical , well , stereotypes exist for a reason . they are fixed points in a changing and unpredictable universe . we sort of like our doctors to be humanists and one of the crowd , and we like our professors thoughtful and quirky , and the sheriff hard-headed , realistic , and given to derisive laughter when he hears an implausible tale . there 's a scene in which john agar and mara corday are driving in the doc 's nifty 1950s ford convertible through the empty desert , and he shares with her his sense of awe at living in a landscape like this . everything that has ever walked or crawled has left its mark in this desert ... she asks him to pull over and stop . they sit on a rock and chat in the middle of this vast void . the scene only lasts a few minutes , but for those few minutes we could wish we were part of that couple , innocent , capable of inspiration , still able to look at emptiness and recognize beauty in it . my guess is that the location for this scene is now part of a strip mall and the vacant lots sparkle with bent soda cans and styrofoam . would that we were at three and a half billion and there were room enough left for wonder at a natural landscape . it 's a simple , unpretentious movie made for adults as well as kids . you 'll enjoy it .		6		1
penny dreadful is an interesting film . it 's simplistic and executed for most of it 's 98 minute running time intensely . but it drops the ball so drastically in it last quarter that the film almost falters completely . no doubt the most entertaining of the three it tells the story of a young girl named penny whom witnessed her parents dying in a car accident . growing up some years later she has a fear of cars and is taken by her psychiatrist up to the mountains to confront this fear head on at the place it happened . however upon reaching their destination they accidentally hit a grotesque hitchhiker and upon dropping him off are left stranded in the middle of nowhere after he attacks the car . with a blown off tire , no cell phone reception and a busted ankle penny is left to fend for herself against the homicidal maniac . the concept is simple and scary imagined being entrapped in such a small space and terrorized . people of course come to help and are brutally slain . some of the suspense sequences work wonderfully well from the camouflaging of the killer , to noises and sounds in the night . rachael miner 's performance as penny is multi layered and award worthy . the film has some nice supporting nods to from mimi rogers and others . the direction is decent and promising while the score and cinematography are top notch and quite impressive . the films problems are simple pacing , it gets a little long in places , the killer he should never be aloud to speak and the final act . what seems to be racing towards a crazy finale ends up reaching it boiling point early and never erupts . the finale is weak and predictable and because this is such a simplistic movie it 's hard to understand why they could n't have executed a standard finale with the same intense gusto they had been demonstrating throughout . in the end penny dreadful is engaging , entertaining and delightfully creepy but with further tweaking we could 've had a horror classic on our hands .		6		1
so finally , after decades of futuristic scientists proclaiming that virtual reality will someday be here , it 's here - sort of . hollywood 's always been a midwife for technology between the science industry and the common man , and in the area of virtual reality it 's given us `` johhny mnemonic '' and this actioner , starring denzel washington . basic plot is this : the police have been using virtual reality as a training method , to test recruits . before they use it on real cops , though , they draft crooks out of prison to act as guinea pigs . this is where washington comes in . a former cop -lrb- how convenient -rrb- , washington 's been rotting in jail for years . so the cops ask him to volunteer to be a part of the experiment , and of course he agrees - but the computer he 's going to be downloaded into has other plans . the ` virtual ' cops are supposed to face this tough criminal in the system , you see , but the computer 's decided to combine all of the nasty characteristics of famous real-life killers - and then download itself into a real , sentient being -lrb- russell crowe -rrb- . and of course it 's up to our man washington to save the day . so there you have it , folks . it 's a standard cops n robbers plot moved ahead a few centuries to take advantage of modern technology . of course , it 's set in the future , which here is portrayed as busy , grimy , a bit . . hmm , a lot like the present , come to think of it , and not very inventive . and the effects are nothing special , either ; you 'd think with virtual reality being the centerpiece you 'd see some dazzling special effects . not really . the cast is good , and crowe turns in a solid -lrb- if a bit hammy , but most bad guys are , are n't they ? -rrb- performance . washington is no better or worse than usual , which means the real culprit is the script here . do yourself a favor and wait for a two-for-one night at your video store to see this one .		6		1
¨ we are not going to let that guy come through our town without a fight . ¨ believe me , that line sounds a lot cooler when arnie says it . the last stand is his first film in a lead role since terminator 3 rise of the machines way back in 2003 . schwarzenegger is getting old , but he still has the charisma of a true action star . as his character in the terminator promised he came back and he did so in this guilty pleasure action packed film directed by jee-woon kim -lrb- i saw the devil , the good the bad and the weird -rrb- from south korea . this film should n't be confused with the third film of the x-men -lrb- the last stand -rrb- franchise , although it does share some similarities in that this is another mindless fun action film in which we can laugh at the craziness of it all . this is a typical schwarzenegger film that brings back some nostalgic memories of his movies using the same successful formula he used during the 80s and 90s . he is always at his best when he is given short dialogue and can answer back with some clever and funny one liners . that is exactly the case with his role here since he seems to be making fun of himself and his old age . he always has been a good sport parodying himself , his accent and his acting chops . that is what has made him such a likable actor over the years , and that is the reason this movie is entertaining despite the ridiculous plot and story -lrb- written by andrew knauer -rrb- . i think schwarzenegger fans will be very pleased with this movie and have a fun time because it is a very passable and enjoyable film . sheriff ray owens -lrb- arnold schwarzenegger -rrb- , a former lapd officer , has moved back to his small local community of sommerton junction . he counts only with three inexperienced deputies : mike -lrb- luis guzman -rrb- , jerry -lrb- zach gilford -rrb- , and sarah -lrb- jaimie alexander -rrb- , but they seem to be more than enough since nothing ever really seems to happen in this quiet town . meanwhile a dangerous drug kingpin named gabriel cortez -lrb- eduardo noriega -rrb- has escaped from an fbi prisoner convoy and is headed south in order to try to reach the border before the authorities catch up to him . agent john bannister -lrb- forest whitaker -rrb- is in charge of the operation , but his men have failed to catch the elusive fugitive . now the only thing that stands between gabriel 's escape is sommerton , and the sheriff will be waiting for him , but in order to do so he must prepare his unqualified men with the help of a local weapon fanatic named lewis dinkum -lrb- johnny knoxville -rrb- . together this unlikely team will have to do what the fbi could n't : stop gabriel before he reaches the border . this gritty and violent film works really well because it decides to incorporate a lot of comedy . it kind of makes fun of itself in its way , and that self parody is what saves this clichéd action genre film . arnold schwarzenegger has a lot of very funny lines and he makes fun of his old age , but he has n't lost his physical strength . the rest of the cast is pretty interesting , although johnny knoxville goes a bit over the top with his performance . the secondary characters of sommerton are the real surprise of this film as they share the funniest scenes while interacting with each other . luis guzman , zach gilford , and jaimie alexander all have some funny scenes , but the true star of the film is arnie with all the gunfights and explosions going on . this mindless film is enjoyable thanks to the funny moments throughout and some entertaining action scenes . there is n't anything that really stands out about this film ; it is just your average action film , but it marks arnie 's comeback and it 's worth it just for that . i also felt a lot of nostalgia since this film reminded me so much of the movies i watched growing up , but that is about it . this is n't one film you have to watch , but if you are a schwarzenegger fan then you will enjoy this movie . http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/		6		1
seven `` saw '' movies , two `` hostel '' flicks and countless of lesser known imitations later , bloodthirsty horror audiences clearly still ca n't get enough of the so-called torture porn movies . the latest , but surely not the last , entry in this dubious horror trend is called `` the collector '' and offers -- as to be expected -- nothing new or even remotely original to the concept of torture porn , but at least somewhat distinguishes itself from the majority thanks to a handful of imaginative gory set pieces and even a few likable characters that you even cheer for . the lead character is an ex-con named arkin who tries really to walk the righteous path by working as a handyman in the remote mansion of a wealthy family that moved to the countryside . his ex-wife has debt and mean people chasing her , however , so arkin is practically forced to return to the mansion at night and break into the family vault . bad move , of course , because that same night the mansion already got invaded by a psychopathic serial killer known as the collector because he targets entire families for annihilation but keeps one of them alive to add to his collection . the killer wears a mask and never speaks a word , but if you know the cinematic classics , you 'll quickly figure out who he is ! he 's the now adult kevin mcallister from the `` home alone '' movies , and you can tell quite easily because he booby trapped the entire house with deadly devices , like a room full of wolf traps , a spider 's web with steel cables and chandeliers with knives attached to them ! personally i think the biggest strongpoint of `` the collector '' is that it unfolds like a fairly primitive `` saw for dummies '' . the toys and booby traps jigsaw prepares for his victims are so hi-tech , meticulous and convoluted that they becomes preposterous and absurd , whereas the killing methods of mr. collector are straightforward but equally effective and gruesome . also , it 's nice to have a killer who shuts up and looks sinister for a change , because the endless long and dull morality speeches of jigsaw where beginning to get on my nerves . `` the collector '' is a film that will definitely appeal to the insatiable nowadays horror crowd , what with its extreme gore , loud & heavy soundtrack -lrb- depeche mode , woo-hoo ! -rrb- and gratuitous bits of nudity provided by the luscious madeline zima as the family 's rebellious teenage daughter . the make-up effects are more than adequate and marcus dunstan , co-writer of `` feast '' , does a relatively fine job in his first directorial accomplishment .		6		1
this was pretty good entry in the val lewton horror collection , even though it 's anything but `` horror . '' this film is a straight drama , almost a film noir about a paranoid sea captain -lrb- richard dix -rrb- who eliminates anyone who disagrees with his `` authority , '' a key word in this movie . russell wade is the captain 's protégé , and the story really centers around him and the conflict he has with his boss after he begins to find out what a violent nutcase he happens to be . along the way , it was noteworthy to see lawrence tierney play one of the captain 's victims . also good was jacob `` sparks '' winslow as the ship 's radio operator . this is an involving film as we root for wade to expose this captain and to convince others that the man with the `` authority '' is an evil person .		6		1
you know a trek film has some problems when the episode of the original series it calls to mind is `` the way to eden , '' the one with the space hippies seeking their own version of a planetary eden . this film has good intentions ; it seeks to return to trek 's potent theme of exploration , of seeking answers on more than just the physical level , after a trilogy of films which stressed space battles , chasing about and future politics . however , the writer and first-time director shatner should be court-martialed : they seem to have no understanding of the concepts presented or even of the general trek universe . the first half of the film seems influenced by shatner watching too many action movies taking place in the desert ; he appears hellbent on transplanting scenes from `` lawrence of arabia '' into the trek worlds . overall , shatner 's approach is best described as flippant ; he sets up scenes well , then throws them away with ludicrous turns of plot , such as the early one where spock plays superman to the rescue of kirk 's lois lane in yosemite national park . no one paused to think or challenge shatner with the opinion that it just looks plain silly . he extends this approach to his fellow actors . yes - doohan , takei , koenig and nichols are given more to do than usual here , but the extra stuff usually involves them looking clownish ; we 're not laughing with them , as in the previous `` the voyage home , '' but at them : sulu & chekov lost in the woods ; uhura 's ` erotic ' dance ; scotty knocking himself out . was shatner hinting that they were all acquiring senility by this point ? and what was the point of all the business about nothing working on this new enterprise ? i guess starfleet rushed in putting this ship together ? shatner is now ridiculing the ship , on top of everything else . this is n't a total mess . a lot of the casual banter , mostly among the main trio -lrb- kirk , spock , mccoy -rrb- still works , a benefit of these actors having worked together for so long . but , the one who steals the movie is luckinbill as the enigmatic sybok , the emotional vulcan who drives the plot . it 's a charismatic performance and you kind of buy into the whole premise of his hypnotic power to gather his followers , including even key members of kirk 's crew . the most powerful scene must be when sybok uses his power on mccoy and we get a glimpse into what drove this character during the original series , including his often fatalistic approach to things . the whole thing revolves around sybok 's plan to acquire a starship so that he can journey to the galactic barrier -lrb- the same one from the `` where no man has gone before '' pilot episode ? -rrb- , pierce it to enter the galactic center and meet god . it 's not very complicated . and they make it look easy enough so that almost anyone could zoom in over there . once there , they encounter a run-of-the-mill energy alien - the kind they ran into every other week on the original series , and sybok gets a cold splash of reality ; yes , life is certainly not a dream . shatner is not able to tie the thought-provoking concepts together into some kind of cohesive whole , probably because he was more concerned with presenting an action picture . for him , it was more exciting to have his character climbing rocks or scrambling to avoid an angry alien than to attempt some metaphysical answers . blame was placed on lack of money for better fx at the climax , but i really do n't think that would have helped . this should have been the of the film series , but they managed to bring them all back together for a classy finish in the next one , `` the undiscovered country .

from after dark films , a simple little story of terror . penny -lrb- rachel miner -rrb- has been traumatized severely by witnessing her parents die in an auto accident . her therapist orianna volkes -lrb- mimi rogers -rrb- takes her on a road trip as part of her therapy to overcome the fear of cars . it is pretty rough going ; and gets rougher when they almost rundown a hitchhiker -lrb- liz davies -rrb- on a long lonesome mountain highway . of course at the expense of knowing a hell of a lot better , orianna decides to give the shaken hitchhiker a ride down a dirt road not much better than a hiking trail . letting their passenger out , it is discovered a knife is stuck in one of the tires rendering a flat . cell phones are useless ; so the therapist takes a walk looking for help . is there not a killer lurking in the woods in a flick like this ? a dreadful detour for sure . also in the cast : chad todhunter , mickey jones , tammy and michael berryman .		6		1
just how far down the barrel does one rotten apple manage to spoil its neighbours and how far can a gripping and unending bitterness take you down the path of insanity ? lakeview terrace , a two hour sociology tinged with arrays of psycho analysis fit for the screen goes about raising and answering these questions in what is an interesting but not entirely gripping experience . addressing themes of racism , regret and many forms of domestic quibble , the movie is one that goes about delivering its themes with volume , but not exactly with conviction or memorable panache ; it 's a myriad of ideas , all intelligent and thought provoking that will no doubt engage viewers on their own merits , but moving far too slowly and jumping off into the absurd for its final act , lakeview terrace certainly feels like a nightmare experience , but its not one that will haunt you as much it should . telling the story of newlywed couple and first-time homeowners chris and lisa mattson as they move into their new neighbourhood under the watchful eye of stern police officer abel turner , writers david loughery and howard korder tell the rather underused neighbour from hell story . unluckily for them , chris and lisa soon become victim to abel 's unrelenting prejudices regarding their inter-racial relationship that draws the attention of his children for all the wrong reasons ; but not the reasons that first caught abel 's attention of course . from here the movie makes it its sole purpose to develop the couple as victims to abel - the evil villain with power on his side and who is more than able to produce ample tension and fear into his well-intentioned neighbours . for the most part , this is achieved , but the script from a to b all too slowly , doing well in developing the three central characters , but distractedly so . thankfully director neil labute knows well enough that the most engaging of antagonists have their fair share of lighter , more tragic sides ; abel has his fair share of such human qualities . in what is perhaps one of his finer performances of the past decade , samuel jackson here embodies his character with utter conviction and drives the movie forward even when it refuses to do so itself . not only does he do a terrific job in conveying abel 's harsher , more intimidating side , but key instances where the focus is instead on why abel is the way he is result in characterisation that feels well conceived and natural . co-stars patrick wilson and kerry washington do n't necessarily have to do quite as much as jackson , playing the sheepish everyday newlyweds from beginning to end , but they hold their own enough to keep the movie afloat . despite some technical flaws in structure and implementation however , one of the most striking aspects of lakeview terrace is its aesthetic design which goes a long way to furthering the script 's themes of racial paranoia and prejudice . one these central elements lies in jeff and mychael danna 's score , which opens and closes the movie with an intriguing fluidity and foreboding tension . rogier stoffers ' photography remains , for the most part , simple , but when the script calls for stark images , he delivers amply , particularly through moments that bring in the movie 's side-plot of sorts involving a spreading forest fire . of course this fire not only provides for some stunning shots , but echoes the themes once more present within the screenplay , detailing an out of control fire spreading like a deadly poison through anything it comes within proximity to . in the end , one is likely to leave a screening of lakeview terrace with conflicting thoughts . the film , by all intents and purposes , is a strong and important one ; delivering on themes without becoming too preachy or condescending , the feature gets its message across for sure , but then again it is n't going to be something you 'll want to watch again any time soon . for those extremely interested in sociology and psychology , there will be plenty of material here to keep you interested , but a distinct lack of focus and direction hurts the movie 's ability to keep the viewer engaged when bullet points are being dragged on . this , and a notably dubious third act belittle the ideas present within the script , making them interesting and thought provoking , but always in a vague subtext sort of way . lakeview terrace certainly addresses issues , but it does n't confront them , at least not with the passion that one would expect , and that is its ultimate undoing ; a numb , albeit intellectually rewarding two hours . - written by jamie robert ward -lrb- http://www.invocus.net -rrb-		6		1
john cleese leads an all-star cast in this funny , but overrated crime comedy . crooks wanda -lrb- jamie lee curtis -rrb- and her lover otto -lrb- kevin kline -rrb- have successfully stolen millions of dollars worth of diamonds from a bank in london , england , along with george and a stuttering animal-lover , ken -lrb- michael palin -rrb- . they hide the stash in a safe , then pretend that they will meet back in three days to fly somewhere away from england . but george goes back , hides the stash in an airport security deposit box , and puts the key to the safe in his pocket . however , he does n't realize that wanda and otto are planning to turn him in to the police and take the loot for themselves . they do so , only one problem : when they go for the diamonds , they 're not there . now they must take a trip to george -lrb- who is in jail , of course -rrb- to discover where he has hid the jewels . george does n't suspect wanda , but suspects otto of turning him in . he does n't tell her where the jewels are . so wanda meets with george 's lawyer , john cleese , the only man who george would talk to , and the only man who could possibly know where the diamonds are . wands plays cleese for information , but soon chaos ensues and the plot takes so many twists and turns it 's hard to say what happens without ruining some gags . `` a fish called wanda '' is probably a bit too fondly remembered . i heard so much about this movie and was really expecting a lot . yes , it 's funny , and yes , it has very funny moments , but i really expected more than i got . john cleese does a good job playing a british lawyer , or bannister , or whatever they are called in england . curtis does a good job playing a smart thief who uses her good looks and charm to lure men into her trap . michael palin is great as a stuttering ken . but the best of the cast is kevin kline as otto . he is a wild guy who is both impulsive and aggressive . a bad mix . one of my favorite scenes is where he comes in to apologize to john cleese , and finds a robber in cleese 's home , assaults the robber , then realizes it is cleese himself , and says , `` i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , '' then starts saying , `` how was i supposed to know it was you ? i mean , what kind of person robs their own home ? hey , yeah , what kind of person robs their own home , you idiot ! '' and he starts to kick him . it shows how much of a problem this guy has . another one of my favorites is just about anytime he and michael palin are on screen . otto 's mimicking of ken -lrb- `` 's to me ! '' -rrb- ranks high as a . but just about any scene with the two men is hilarious . the script is nice , and does n't go overboard at anytime . but i still think the film is a bit overrated . i laughed , i had fun , but it was n't one of the most memorable comedies i 've ever seen . i 've seen much better , to tell you the truth . 4/5 stars - john ulmer		6		1
nacho libre -lrb- 2006 , dir . jared hess -rrb- nacho is a monastery cook , who spends his day feeding orphans and being overlooked by the monastery . when sister encarnación arrive at the monastery , nacho realises that the only way to win her affection and to save the children , will be by competing as a luchador wrestler . although ` nacho libre ' is advertised as being made by the director of ` napoleon dynamite ' and writer of ` school of rock ' , this film is no where near as good . there are some good jokes featured and there are some fun scenes , but in ends up as a film just for fans of jack black of wrestling . there does n't seem to have enough jokes in this film to attract adults . however , it is a good film with a great performance by jack black , but it limits itself to a particular audience . `` so , what you 're saying to me is if i can eat this yolk , my moves will become the best in the whole world .

eons ago it seems , wesley snipes was a box office commodity . so much so that promising material was refashioned to his action persona to the eventual detriment of the end product and fellow co-stars . this is exactly what happened with boiling point -- which , apart from being a rather meaningless title -lrb- snipes ' character never seems all that livid at any point -lcb- sic -rcb- during the picture ! -rrb- , is doubly superfluous for being identical to the superior takeshi kitano vehicle released three years earlier . on a personal note , i greatly enjoyed the location shooting in the hollywood streets which effortlessly brought back nostalgic flashbacks to my three-month trip over there between november 2006 . writer/director harris -- formerly stanley kubrick 's producer on his earlier films and the man behind one of the quintessential `` cold war '' movies , the bedford incident -lrb- 1965 -rrb- -- supplies some good lines and colorful roles to a fine group of veteran and up-and-coming actors : dennis hopper -lrb- particularly outstanding as the pitiful small-time criminal with -rrb- , viggo mortensen -lrb- as his cold-blooded murdering partner -rrb- , tony lo bianco -lrb- as the big cheese in the l.a. underworld and hopper 's one-time associate -rrb- , seymour cassel -lrb- as a hardened crook -rrb- and tobin bell -lrb- as a jailed counterfeiter -rrb- . the women , represented here by lolita davidovich -lrb- as a high-class hooker that numbers both snipes and hopper among her clients -rrb- and valerie perrine -lrb- as hopper 's world-weary old flame -rrb- , fare less well as their roles are comparatively underdeveloped . snipes is a cigar-chomping -lrb- ! -rrb- treasury agent hot on the heels of hopper and mortensen for having caused the death of one of his colleagues in an undercover operation . apart from the fact that dying at the very beginning allows no time for the all-important friendship between the dead cop and snipes to be established , i also found it hard to swallow the many would-be ironical run-ins that snipes and hopper have throughout the film : at a food stand , in a hotel toilet , in the bar where perrine `` slings hash '' , etc. . besides , the relationship between snipes and davidovich -lrb- which , we are told in the ` faux ' `` where are they now ? '' end titles , even extends to her moving out with him to the next state he is transferred to ! -rrb- is never believable as opposed to that of hopper and perrine . to the film 's credit , the script also takes care to further enhance character development by delving briefly into the troubled relationships that mortensen and cassel are having with their current companions .		6		1
this movie was ok , i 'm sure a lot of teen boys liked it since it 's all about megan fox 's body . jennifer , played by fox , and her best friend -lrb- the sort of nerdy needy -rrb- go to a bar to see a band . well this band is evil and they take jennifer . needy goes home and jennifer shows up all covered in blood and vomiting black liquid . needy 's not sure what 's wrong but the next day at school , jennifer is as glam as ever . a couple of high schoolers are killed and finally jennifer tells needy what happened when the band took her . so the final is needy trying to save her boyfriend from jennifer . this movie was sort of written as a dark comedy . and i think megan was good as the sexy twisted teen . one problem was most of the gore was off screen or if shown only for a second . final verdict : great for those into teen slasher type films .		6		1
being facetious , one could say that the premise of the movie is pure science fiction fantasy : a somewhat overweight dope-smoking slacker somehow meets an absolutely beautiful woman who has been promoted to an on-air role on an entertainment tv programme . the beautiful woman in question is katherine heigl , who plays alison scott . she has a terrific dead-pan persona when dealing with the slacker 's ways & attitudes -lrb- the slacker is ben stone , played by seth rogen -rrb- ... a real poker-face . i 'm not sure if heigl 's teeth have been done by industrial light & magic , but they are hard to look at without sunglasses . anyway , as a result of scott & stone 's union , scott gets pregnant . this serves as the premise for which this odd couple spend more time with each other than one would ordinarily expect . much of the humour arises from stone 's slacker ways -lrb- along with his friends too ... each of which is horrifyingly interesting ... like a car-crash -rrb- . the way scott does n't give anything away in dealing with stone is also funny . the good thing about this movie is the way that the comedic load is shared amongst the cast ... from the main players to people with minor roles . e.g. the scenes with scott 's superiors are very funny ... especially her female superior , who is a bit of a seething mass of resentment towards alison . or the married couple scott and stone hang out with -lrb- the wife is scott 's sister -rrb- . both married characters get to steal a few scenes with their face pulling or outrageous opinions . i especially like the scene where alison 's sister just has a melt-down when a black bouncer refuses to let her and alison into a night club . what is even better is when the black bouncer gets to say some good lines in response . for me , the movie tends to fall a bit towards the ben and the husband take magic mushrooms before seeing cirque de soleil . it is n't quite as funny as it sounds . things pick up for the funny birth scene .		6		1
watching the three stooges movie for the new century i got the impression i was watching one giant tribute show , something along the lines of james whitmore doing harry truman . maybe sean hayes , will sasso , and chris diamantopoulos might do just that and take a live show on the road should this film prove successful . as the three stooges back in the day did their work at columbia pictures i was wondering why columbia instead of 20th century fox did this particular film . but who am i to complain as these ersatz caricatures did a reasonably good job at imitating the originals . the stooges start out as boys with three kids doing imitations of them , they were left as foundling babies at a catholic orphanage . as they grow up they never leave the nest , moe almost gets adopted but turns it down saying they 're a package deal . nobody wanted that particular package and they took an altogether different kid . evil times befall the orphanage and the stooges go out into the world looking to raise $ + to pull the orphanage from debt . on the way they save the life of the kid who was adopted in moe 's place and who has grown up to be kirby heyborne . do you doubt the orphanage was saved in stooge fashion of course . some definite changes come into place there . special mention should go to larry david who played the nun who was the special target , even inadvertently of stooges mayhem . he steals every scene he 's in with the three stooges . young audiences might appreciate this film , a chance to become acquainted with a true american institution . hopefully they will check out the real deal as well .		6		1
`` monkey shines '' is an honorable effort that does n't quite work . it deserves credit for originality , but falls short of the mark . the concept is interesting , but the execution leaves much to be desired . a paralyzed man 's life is made easier with the help of ellie , a monkey trained to help disabled people get by with their daily lives . however , she used to be a lab animal who has had human brain cells injected in experiments . a bond forms between the two , and she acts out his violent desires . the final act does a good job in delivering the goods , but the film takes too long to get going , diluting the overall effect . in fact , at times one almost forgets it 's supposed to be a horror movie . when it gets going , it works , although the very ending is a bit much . i 'm still not sure the sci-fi gimmick was necessary . surely they could have done pretty much the same things without it ? something more supernaturally orientated perhaps ? still , i admired romero 's willingness to take chances and try his hand at a more subdued thriller . jason beghe does a credible job in the role , and we are offered a rare glance at the frustrations of the disabled . a tighter film would have better achieved the director 's goals . ** 1/2 -lrb- out of **** -rrb- an orion pictures release		6		1
i was kind of surprised that michael mann directed this , , usually his films have tons more action in them , that being said , i guess this is n't ' sposed to be an action movie , it 's about a whistle blower in the industry , , a scientist who discovers what the big boys are up to trying to hook the american public into smoking cigarettes , and what deceptive practices and lying that they do , , such as spiking the cigarettes . he get 's fired from big tobacco and has to sign a confidentiality agreement , saying that he wont ' release secrets , , at first he does n't want to but later agrees , , but then the company adds on more stuff to the agreement , , then he end up not signing it and the company goes after the ex employee , , sending him vicious notes in the mail , and fire bombing his house , , he goes to a reporter from 60 minutes for help , , not a bad movie , , just slow moving in parts , , a little hard to watch at times .		6		1
`` war is a drug . '' so reads the quotation by american journalist chris hedges that precedes kathryn bigelow 's `` the hurt locker . '' the film has a clear thesis , but offers little of substance to extrapolate or back it up . the movie is remarkably effective on the gut level of provoking an emotional response , but relies on a few disappointing action clichés that prevent it from truly being the masterpiece others have been so quick to hail it as . the aforementioned quote refers to the , protagonist of the film , staff sergeant william james -lrb- jeremy renner -rrb- , who deals so intimately with death in his day job , that everything else starts to feel a little bit dull by comparison . or at least that 's the idea . in execution , james comes off more as your prototypical action hero than the fascinating subject of a character study . he behaves like every other superman to grace the screen in recent memory , and the film declines to comment on this condition until the last thirty minutes or so , making what should be the core of the piece feel more like an afterthought . the pacing is unhelpful as well , broken up as the story is into isolated encounters that neither build in the traditional narrative sense nor offer more than a diverting peripheral glimpse into the lives of the characters . the sequences are so arbitrarily episodic that their order could seemingly be shuffled with little to no detriment to the comprehensibility of the story arc . ostensibly , `` the hurt locker '' is a film with a clearly defined beginning and end and enough style to keep what 's in between from feeling stagnant . sure , the bomb diffusion sequences are great . through the use of ambient sound effects and hand-held camera work -lrb- a testament to its correct usage -rrb- with an almost hitchcockian suspense-building prowess , bigelow is able to masterfully pluck the audience 's heartstrings like so many delicate red wires . it 's a shame these refreshing , interesting , entertaining pieces of the film are undercut by its vacuous , nearly non-existent story . and though i 'll champion the style in a general sense , the film 's pleasing documentary aesthetic is blatantly violated in two auspicious moments , and as far as i can remember , only two . one is a matrix-esquire dancing bullet shell that meets the sand in super-slow motion , and the other , a bomb exploding at an equally fast from multiple angles , letting the audience pause to consider the visual significance of watching the paint peel from the skeleton of a car or a dust cloud rippling in the blast . the moments are pure hollywood and feel completely removed from the intention of the rest of the film . perhaps the most profound moment comes toward the end , when james is confronted with the one , and really only , consequence of his actions , leading to the serious injury of a squad member . however , the implications are decidedly secondary to the film 's conclusion , which has all the subtlety and self-aware military chic of an army recruitment spot , which sabotages james ' only meaningful character change and will likely send you out of the theater with a razz between your lips . so ignore the hype and the nonsensical title . if you approach `` hurt locker '' looking for a little summer fun , the ingredients are assuredly there . just do n't let the art house fool you into thinking kathryn bigelow 's latest offers much more than a few cheap thrills . if war is a drug , `` the hurt locker '' is a placebo .		6		1
recap : in a near future two games are on everyone 's mind , society and slayer . society is kind of like an advanced sims and slayer is like counterstrike . but with the small difference that both now feature real humans . john tillman aka kable is one of the big stars of slayer . like all characters in slayer he is a convicted murderer , in for life , but if he can survive the coming battles he can win his freedom . however , john knows too much about the origins to the game , and now extremely rich inventor ken castle is never going to let him survive . comments : average action that is lacking by annoying camera movement . supposed to augment a futuristic and action filled story , but the shaky camera movement disturbs me . it steals focus from an otherwise all right story . sure it will never win any awards for ingenuity or make a serious statement , but is quite entertaining . mostly the action is very good , it seem like nothing has been spared on the visual and special effects , some are quite impressive . however , sometimes it seems like too much focus has been spent on the effects instead of the story . the story should carry the movie , but seems too thin at times . in fact , at a few points i felt left out by the story , like it had some major plot holes . it cleaned many of those holes up in the end , but the feeling was not good at all times . well , i guess it turned out all right in the end . worked well enough for an evening anyway . 6/10		6		1
dashiell hammett story becomes much-acclaimed directorial debut for john huston , with definitive role for humphrey bogart as hard-boiled detective sam spade , here solving the murder of his partner while chasing down a priceless artifact which dates back to the 1500s . third filming of this story -lrb- the others were in 1931 and 1936 , the latter as `` satan met a lady '' -rrb- is set in san francisco yet features practically no location footage -lrb- and the stock shots at the beginning are painful to look at -rrb- . set-bound noir seems awfully constricted , but bogart is fully into his role and has a great time ; supporting performances from peter lorre -lrb- a perfumed question mark -rrb- and sydney greenstreet are also excellent . swear by the film , but it never really catches fire . ** 1/2 from ****		6		1
it 's curious how in some southern states the practice of voodoo , or in the case of `` the skeleton key '' , hoodoo , people do n't seem to believe in the practice of these rites , yet , everyone is in awe of the magical powers behind these sort of religions . voodoo , hoodoo , or even santeria , are religious practices brought from africa from the poor black people that were forced into slavery , and continue to be practiced in some sort of variation , even today . that is the premise behind this film . a young health care worker , caroline ellis , arrives at what appears to be a haunted house in rural louisiana . the man of the house , ben devereaux , has been stricken by a rare illness that is never specified , but it has made him weak and must be helped for everything by his young nurse . ben is married to the strident violet , a woman who seems to know much more than what she tells caroline . for starters , there are no mirrors in the house , which is strange . violet gives caroline the master key , or ` skeleton key ' to the house , but warns her not to poke her nose into the attic . well , it 's just like telling caroline : `` here , go and snoop in there '' , which she does . what she finds really surprises her . the pictures she finds , together with all the other paraphernalia make caroline suspect there is much more involved behind ben 's illness and violet 's apparent sweetness . to complicate things more , there is luke marshall , a young lawyer , who we meet at the beginning of the story , but who seems to be closer to violet in more ways than one . caroline will discover things she did n't imagine were there . in a surprising twist at the end , even caroline ca n't help get more than what she bargained for when she decided to investigate what was wrong in the first place . kate hudson , as caroline is perfect as the somewhat naive woman with an inquisitive mind . gina rowlands plays violet devereaux , who seems to hold not only the skeleton key , but she is the key for understanding what goes on in that spooky southern mansion . john hurt is seen briefly as the long suffering husband . peter sarsgaard appears as the sly lawyer who knows a lot more than he lets on . for lovers of the horror genre , director iain softley , has worked hard to involve the viewer in the story . although a trifle slow at the beginning the director picks up the pace during the last part of the movie creating the necessary suspense to please the viewer .		6		1
my wife , friend dan and i saw the movie . we all liked the mummy series . we all discussed it and found the movie okay . however , it does not have the strong acting like the mummy . the movie tried to be a cross between the movies conan and the mummy . i expected a bit more from the action scenes . the ending was the typical hollywood formula ending . nothing special about this one . 6/10		6		1
i 'm a little biased in my judgement of this film -- not only because i 've read the novel , but also because i 've seen sergei bondarchuk 's 1960s soviet adaptation , which is undoubtedly one of cinema 's most spectacular epics . any comparison leaves vidor 's hollywood adaptation , for all its merits , beaten and conquered . despite clocking in at a respectable 200 minutes , ` war and peace -lrb- 1956 -rrb- ' is simply too short to do justice to tolstoy 's vision . the episodic nature of the novel means that it ca n't be readily condensed into a regular feature-length time frame , and the film 's narrative is often choppily composed to fit everything in . i think i 'm forever destined to imagine the main characters as they appear in the 1960s film , but the main actors here are nevertheless passable . henry fonda , sporting a misplaced american twang , brings an accurate passivity of the role of pierre bezukhov . audrey hepburn half works : early on , her natasha rostova lacks the vibrant , bright-eyed naiveté of lyudmila , but the actress portrays beautifully the compassion and weariness of the `` grown-up '' natasha . the battle scenes are large in scale , but curiously narrow in scope , with the battle of borodino -- in the 1960s film , an astonishing hour of unfettered pandemonium viewed through a god-like lens -- seen mostly through the eyes of pierre .		7		1
waiting ... reviewed by sam osborn of www.samseescinema.com rating : 3 out of 4 director : robert mckittrick cast : ryan reynolds , justin long , chi mcbride , anna faris , dane cook screenplay : robert mckittrick mpaa classification : r -lrb- strong and crude sexual humor , pervasive language and some drug use -rrb- 2005 has , as of yet , been dubbed as the year for comedy 's comeback . with two hugely popular comedies -lrb- wedding crashers and 40 year old virgin -rrb- pooling tickets sales much past the $ 100 million mark at the box office , lions gate productions ' new entry , waiting , could n't have hoped for a better crowd for their film to leap into . thankfully , waiting continues 2005 's tradition of quality comedy . it 's certainly not as good as the other broad comedies lauded this year , but its low , low , low brow humor and consistently funny gross-out gags are sure to satisfy the same audiences that loved the crashers and the virgin . the film takes place over the course of one day , following the lives of the waiters , cooks , and manager of the family restaurant chain shenanigans -lrb- in a nice nod to troopers -rrb- . heading up the cast is justin long playing dean , whose day 's taken a nosedive since his mother mentioned , once again , the success stories of his former high school classmates . dean 's story actually plays as waiting 's backbone story , focusing on his dismay at the prospect of becoming assistant manager at shenanigans and wasting his life away waiting tables . but , really , most of waiting 's laughs lie in the crazy antics of the rest of the cast . first time director/writer robert mckittrick , wrote the screenplay to work as a kind of oddball ensemble film , where we flit about the restaurant 's many characters and their insane issues . connecting most of the characters , however , is the game they all love to play , quaintly titled `` the penis showing game . '' and , yes , the game plays exactly like it sounds . we learn the game and its many strategies through monty 's tour of shenanigans as he trains , mitch -lrb- john daley -rrb- , the new guy . it 's especially popular among the cooks -lrb- fans of stand-up will notice dane cook playing floyd , one of the cook 's -rrb- , who suggest to mitch that , in his free time at the restaurant , he should play with himself and come up with new ways to win the game . admittedly , this sort of humor is why waiting never rises to the level of 40 year old virgin . it 's funny in its persistent repetition and comedic timing , but , at the same time , so low-brow that it loses taste and quickly becomes immature . director mckittrick succeeds in that he smartly captures the bizarre camaraderie between co-workers at temporary jobs . having worked for nearly a year in a similarly depressing job as the characters in waiting -lrb- i 'm a lowly part-time cashier at target -rrb- , i , and surely many other teenagers , can relate to the oddball relationships of these waiters . the film seems to have been written from first-hand experience ; as if mckittrick quit his job , went to film school , and wrote waiting . these characters actually function more as caricatures , but the basis for every one of them comes from the real-life workplace . the final scene is set at a party , and as the last line is read and the credit for unit production manager is superimposed , every member of the audience sit comfortably in their seat , content to watching the characters party . that 's when you know the film works : when we would n't mind sticking around for a couple hours more , hanging out with the people on screen . and although waiting may pull some unnecessary jokes and cross the line into boring immaturity at times , it has enough bizarre truths and likable characters to make it worth of a saturday evening at the multiplex . - www.samseescinema.com		7		1
in life , there are certain moments that when you look back on them a smile plays around your lips . for chris gardner , looking back at 1981 will bring a smile and a tear . the pursuit of happiness stars will smith in his most sincere and serious role since 2001 's ali . here we find smith as chris gardner , an out of luck salesman who is desperately trying to support for his son christopher , played by his real life son jaden smith , and his over worked wife linda -lrb- thandie newton -rrb- . one day while on his way to try and persuade some doctors to buy a portable bone density scanner , chris runs into a well-to-do stock broker who seems to have it all . the car , the job , and the happiness chris is searching for . from that moment on , his determination cranks up higher than ever to try and land a job as a stock broker . all the while linda is slaving at work while trying to deal with their debt and her husbands failing sales career . fed up with his far out dreams , she needs to get closer to reality by leaving all of this behind and starting a new in new york city , even if it means leaving behind the husband she once loved and the son she ca n't care for . chris and christopher now must fend for themselves against the harshness that is life . italian director gabriele muccino had not directed a movie in the states previous to happiness . with the help of writer steve conrad -lrb- the weather man -rrb- , the film was pointed in the right direction . inspired by a true story , there is no better person to fit the shoes of chris gardner than smith , someone who is not shy on letting his emotions spill out onto the film . first timer jaden smith is a blessing for the film . one of the main characters , jaden had to take on a demanding role , at times emotionally stressful . i 'm sure having his papa there was a big help . the two have the perfect on screen chemistry that is intense , memorable , and down to earth . there is a definite bond , for obvious reasons , and it shows on screen . although the story is one that is not so foreign , it is still uplifting . like last years cinderella man , happiness takes on the `` underdog '' genre cleverly and passionately . it is a heart melting tale of one man trying to survive in an urban jungle that is just waiting for the cards to fall in his favor for once . certainly there are a handful a year that aim at pushing this message of `` never give up '' and `` keep on dreaming '' . some just do n't quite succeed be it the acting or a weak and over used story . happiness fits the mold , not breaking it , but certainly filling it to the brim . happiness works on an emotional level . smith carries the picture from beginning to end . never once breaking character or going over the top . you wo n't find groundbreaking filming techniques , but that 's not to say that the film does n't look nice . the music too goes right along with the story , seemingly bringing out the emotions of the characters . in a world where people can be so cold and so harsh , there are those who survive and thrive amongst us . not everyone has there life story told on film . some with the most incredible stories go unnoticed . but there are those that do n't and these are the stories that inspire and keep us believing in ourselves . this film , this story , answers the question , `` why not ?

any film that start with bach 's st mathew passion either has delusions of considerable grandeur or is going to be a tragic tale of moral comeuppance . fortunately - we 've come to the cinema to be entertained - we get both in equal measure in this drama . joe pesci continues the concentrated streak of nastiness with which he burned evry brightly in the early 90s . robert de niro is very effective , slow burning and unsettling . the big draw for me is the surprising , standout performance of sharon stone , the moll as a sassy opportunist . for , in fact , casino is n't primarily a film about gangsters but about a casino : the game , the society , the power struggles . it shows how in trying to twist fate to work unfailingly and consistently to advantage , corruption is as inevitable as mildew . to this end i also like the considerable support cast , be they heavies , players , feds or extras playing with realism . scorsese keeps the film zippy for all its length -lrb- it 's a good movie to compare with the departed -rrb- and bach is just the opening gambit in another fine soundtrack selection . 7/10		7		1
now somewhat expected in scary movies , around 1998 filmmakers daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez made the daring and clever move of not only creating a singular horror film with unknown actors -lrb- which may 've as much been the end product of being relative first-timers of movie making as it would be credited to being ingenious , to be sure -rrb- but also going to work promoting the film as if it were a real occurrence , replete with its own website , its own history , documentation , and plenty -lrb- and i mean plenty -rrb- of interviews and fake newscasts . by the time of it 's running , thru a number or film festivals and word-of-mouth promotions thru the early part of 1999 , the movie was a virtual dynamo of anticipation when it finally landed in commercial theaters a week or two after the 4th of july that year . for the most part , it feels like a lot of invention and inspiration for a movie that , while inspired and effective enough , seems to be really challenging the viewer to love it or hate it . when i first saw it eleven years ago , i was much more in the `` love it '' camp . upon re-watching it in full more recently , i 'd more put it in the `` solid like '' category . treated , at its as a sort of `` super documentary '' , it portends to show the film of an attempted documentary of three film students from baltimore -lrb- heather donahue , michael williams and joshua leonard -- all using their real names and not seemingly attempting to show any distinction that would give them away as actors -rrb- who go on the trail of the rural legend of the blair witch , an 18th century woman who was cast into the woods of post-colonial maryland , only to disappear and somehow , foist curse on the locals in neighboring towns . after roughly eight days of being lost in the woods somehow , the three understandably lose their cools , rationale and eventually much more as their uncanny knack to be tracked by someone -lrb- or something -rrb- in the woods has them unable to think clearly and , ultimately , escape . plenty of `` cinema verite '' and improvisation -lrb- supposedly , the directors made the actors merely react to situations by leaving index cards along the woods telling them of what was happening next -rrb- made this simultaneously one of the more organic and unnerving films lessening of enchantment of this movie is mostly from the passage of time , a chance to digest all the elements of the film/story and the re-evaluation of camera and filming tactics , which , while appreciable for their lack of excess and attention to more intangible fear and atmosphere , seem to be challenging the viewer in ways that threaten to break the viewing experience as well as enhance it . extras on the dvd are a real plus : getting to see much of the back-story attached to this show is a largely satisfying element -lrb- and also gives me some insight into a couple of less-than-flattering reviews -rrb- to accompany a film that may seem a bit thin or `` naked '' on its own . an inspiration for ensuing `` shocker '' movies to come -lrb- cloverfield , quarantine , paranormal activity , the last come to mind -rrb- , this movie is worth a look , though the cleavage of opinion on it is gon na be quite difficult to overcome . back then , a near ten ; now , a weak seven . a keeper ? you be the judge .		7		1
let 's get it out of the way up front . watching this movie can be as painful as falling off a trapeze or being mauled by a lion at times . i 'd imagine especially for folks like dorothy lamour who is in some of the most dreadfully dated costumes and musical numbers . in fact , all of the musical numbers are pretty awful and betty hutton 's singing which is interesting comedy material has no place anywhere near real music . so why watch it ? because it literally brings back history . with circuses nearing extinction like one of the animals they show off it is a treat to see what they were like in their glory days , especially with the legends that made them what they were such as emmett kelly the definitive clown . you also get to see -lrb- through make-up -rrb- jimmy steward and `` ado annie '' in unusual roles . perhaps i 'm prejudiced because i 've only seen one real circus in my life while in college . they came to our campus and i discovered that i was sitting only two rows away , a short hop for him , from a tiger who was licking his lips and staring at me as if he 'd just realized it was lunch time and he 'd like to try some italian -lrb- which i am -rrb- food . thankfully his `` keeper '' distracted him before he could try me out . and i have the opportunity to watch on a big -lrb- 50 + inches -rrb- screen tv so it 's like watching a circus through a window in my living room . but i 'm sure for others as well it would be an interesting experience . we know that the stars are protected from anything really dangerous but they do enough of their own stunts as we read in the trivia section here on imdb that cornel wilde actually got hurt . and you can see -lrb- which surprised me -rrb- that he was actually in good enough shape that he could probably have done the entire professional acrobat routines had his contract and insurance allowed . and you realize while watching the other acts that there is no trick photography involved with the sword swallowing , elephant riding , bareback riding , trick dogs -lrb- and all sorts of other things that would probably be banned by politically correct folks today -rrb- . so , despite wilde chewing scenery with bad acting and a wildly bad pepe accent , despite the awful dialogue and sometimes sexist lines , you find yourself entertained in site of yourself . there are enough surprisingly blatant sexual remarks and double-entendres , and there is some real humor here . but most of all , under the greasepaint are human beings who made history and it 's just plain fun to see what all the fuss was about .		7		1
bringing an novel that is full of detail and subplots into a compatible storyline for a film adaptation can be a difficult procedure . especially when you want the film to still be a successful and compelling feature . no matter how poorly it was done , the film would make big bucks because it 's based off such a popular novel . but `` harry potter and the order of the phoenix '' is not a badly-made movie . yes , it 's flawed and to a considerable degree . it 's not perfect , but it 's a mighty entertaining motion picture . in terms of visual excitement and heart-pounding entertainment , it 's perhaps the best out of all five of the series . i ca n't say if it really is though , for it does have some flaws that i personally can not overlook . really , the main problem with the film overall is not the pacing . like the previous film , `` harry potter and the goblet of fire '' , the very beginning of the movie is , quick-paced , and in some ways , not very clearly made out for the audience members who have not read the book . but in this case , the beginning is so rushed and so poorly made that it 's painful to look at . i 'm sorry , but in my opinion , this movie has one of the worst beginnings of all time . especially in the first five minutes . and for the next thirty or forty minutes , the movie is n't very clear . we meet out main characters of the story much too quickly , some of whom we have n't seen since the third installment `` harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban '' , and we do n't get very much development from them . they are almost unnecessary , yet they get some screen time and lines in the beginning . however , once the beginning has passed by and the parts of the film have dissipated and gone by , `` harry potter and the order of the phoenix '' is magnificently made for the screen . full of come good humor , exciting moments , state-of-the-art visual effects in heart-pounding thrilling sequences , and finally some good character development from our talented cast , the movie keeps you glued to your seat from that point to the ending credits . there are even some really dramatic moments in the film , such as harry 's speech in the hog 's head . it almost seems like a real case of life and death . and there is , of course , the much-anticipated kiss . it did n't really turn out how i was expecting it to be , but it was still good enough for this magical teenager love subplot of the film . it did n't really kick off much in any way afterwards and might leave a few people confused at the end . the bonding we do get is between harry and his friends , his long-gone parents , his teachers , and everyone else who will stand with him during these terrible times for them in their world of wizards and magic . performances by everybody were simply glamorous and well-done . daniel radcliffe , rupert grint , and emma watson are still very talented for their parts and they really seem like the characters from the books in a lot of ways . and this , in my opinion , is n't just owed to the screenplay , but to the actors themselves , who are adjusting and understanding the characters very well and becoming a lot like them . imelda staunton , who played professor umbridge , was keen at the role of being an irritating and dislikable character who acts and behaves sweetly in a creepy manner , just like the one j.k. rowling visualized in the book . umbridge was n't as physically ugly as i was expecting , but the personality was really what mattered . maggie smith , though her screen time was limited , pulled off a good performance again as . and now , michael gambon really does richard harris 's memory proud as he plays professor dumbledore . i admit he was n't exactly keen for the role in the previous two entries where he took over . but now , he does it perfectly as the kindly , mysterious and now frightened headmaster . to sum it all up , `` harry potter and the order of the phoenix '' is just simply , well-drawn out and exciting fun . after its terrible start at the beginning of the film , it rises from the bad part of the scale and excels up with its creativity and visual spectaculars until it becomes what could be , for some people , the best out of all of the film adaptations brought to the screen so far .		7		1
before hammer really hit its stride with regular outings starring peter cushing and christopher lee as adversaries , came this well crafted little piece of science fiction . it 's subtly anti-nuclear in its theme with good suspense and action throughout despite a limited budget . also , unlike most american sci-fi films of the same era , there 's no romance in this film at all . a common subplot in american 50 's sci-fi films was a romance between a woman scientist and lawman or fellow scientist where the man wanted the female scientist to pitch that ph.d. in favor of hands . there 's none of that here - all of the central characters are men . there 's not even the usual conflict followed by partnering of the rather geeky scientist with the gung-ho sceptical lawman , also a common fixture in american 50 's sci-fi . everyone here is pretty much cooperative from the start , all dedicated to finding a solution to the mystery of random thefts of nuclear material coupled with a sudden epidemic of people with radiation sickness and burns . dean jagger is probably the only actor you 'll recognize here as the main character , dr. adam royston , who is employed in a scottish lab doing various experiments on nuclear material when this mystery takes him , at first unwillingly , out of his lab and into the field . jagger is not even trying to feign a scottish accent , and oddly no explanation is ever given as to why an american scientist is working in scotland , as all of the focus is on the mystery , with very little left over for character development . i highly recommend this seldom seen little film for fans of 50 's science fiction films .		7		1

michael keaton , alec baldwin , geena davis , winona ryder , jeffrey jones and catherine o'hara star in tim burton 's 1988 comedy . married couple , adam -lrb- baldwin -rrb- and barbara -lrb- davis -rrb- maitland are on vacation until they die in a car accident . they become ghosts stranded in their house and a family , the deetzes move in changing everything . they try scaring them out of their house and decide to contact a bio-exorcist , beetlejuice -lrb- keaton -rrb- to help them . when beetlejuice gets out of hand , adam and barbara try to stop him . ryder plays lydia deetz who befriends the maitlands and falls for . jones and o'hara play her parents , charles and delia . i used to watch this a lot as a kid , it 's definitely one of burton 's best , keaton is great and danny elfman 's score is also great as usual . i recommend this 80 's classic .		7		1
well-constructed and taut thriller that does not overstay its welcome . under money and other pressures , columbus short agrees to join 5 other employees of an armored car company in order to rob the company by faking a robbery by non-existent robbers , but only if there is no violence . he 's seen enough of that in iraq . when they and their hiding spot for removing the funds are seen by a homeless man , the game plan changes and becomes violent . short locks himself into one of the two armored trucks . now the gang must contend with him , as it tries to get the rear doors to open . their troubles pile up and short takes advantage of several unexpected opportunities . matt dillon as gang leader has a larger part than the others . it was surprising to see jean reno and lawrence fishburne take on these supporting roles . one must work . fishburne 's part as a heavy was more juicy than reno 's . the plot in some ways reminded me of the asphalt jungle , although far less complex and much more action-oriented . but we do get decent characterizations of each man , and we see how their misfortunes affect their behavior in vastly different ways . that 's the heart of the movie and worth seeing . their weaknesses , drives and compulsions vary and so do their reactions when their game plan goes awry . the story ends with an ironic twist worthy of that earlier film noir . this movie is a heist neo-noir and a good one .		7		1
featuring a quite talented cast , this entertains and keeps you interested throughout . the plot is fairly easy to follow . the acting is good for all the parts -lrb- in spite of kingsley 's inexplicable and seemingly random occasional change of accent -rrb- and the characters are good -lrb- aykroyd amuses with his portrayal of a conspiracy nut , though he 's never over the top -rrb- . the main characters make an effective team , and each member contributes , just about equally , too . the editing and cinematography do n't go anywhere you do n't expect them to , but they do n't really need to . the comedy is never forced , just clever and well-delivered . the pacing is great , the movie neither stands still nor rushes through . it 's a fun ride through the entire thing , not to be taken too seriously -lrb- and it never claims to be more than that -rrb- . yes , the political agenda is impossible to miss -lrb- and the very end is almost insulting -rrb- , but that is not surprising , given redford 's involvement . the film works well as a light spy film -lrb- without becoming farcical -rrb- , delivering , as the title suggests , sneaking , as well as conspiracies . as my fiancée pointed out while we watched it , fans of j.j. abrams ' hit series alias will appreciate the elaborate planning and execution of the `` sneaks '' -lrb- though it is not as stylized -rrb- , and there is some gadgetry . enjoyable from start to finish . i recommend this to any fan of spy flicks -lrb- though i 'm not sure people expecting action or mystery in this will find themselves satisfied ... and as a thriller , it 's light at best -rrb- . 7/10		7		1
plastic surgeon danny -lrb- sandler -rrb- picks up women by wearing a wedding band . then , he meets someone he really likes , palmer -lrb- decker -rrb- , and she wo n't have anything to do with a married man . he tells her he is getting a divorce and she buys it . katherine -lrb- aniston -rrb- agrees to be the fake divorcing wife and her kids also play along and the lies keep getting bigger and bigger . there was no end to them . i kept saying that most hollywood comedies have their funny stuff up front in the beginning and then later anything comical is forgotten for the rest of the movie . well , i have to qualify that statement . oh , it 's still true , but not for an adam sandler movie . he has a way to keep the yuks coming throughout . there is nothing overdone , silly , stupid -lrb- ok , well there were a couple silly things , but like i said in a hollywood comedy silly and stupid are mandatory -rrb- or telegraphed where they become tedious and not funny in most other comedies . but this does n't happen in a adam sandler movie . many of his contemporaries should take note , especially the ones i keep saying should be selling used cars . and , sandler even hires some of them for his movies and still they do n't learn anything ? bummer . sometimes a good comedy is based upon a lie , that keeps evolving and funny things can come out of subsequent misunderstandings , and half-truths . that is an old and true comedic formula and sandler knows it , and he has enough sense to keep the funny things going on all the way through . i had to laugh out loud many times . just had to do it . take for example one of the kids who agrees to go along with the lie . she wants to project an english accent . so danny says he wants to hear it first . so she goes , `` '' in a very exaggerated rather high english tone . immediately , danny says , `` no . '' i was almost on the floor . pure gold . i am quite leery of hollywood comedies , but what kept me was the scene in the doctor 's office when a woman came in who had an accident with one of her implants -lrb- it deflated -rrb- . the conversation between danny and his assistant catherine sealed the deal for me and it was quite good . yes , a little on the risqué side , but funny nevertheless . hey , risqué can be funny if it 's done right and this was . hey , i just went with it . ha ! the entire support cast performed well and brooklyn decker may become a very good actress . she held her own . you may have seen her in the recent si swimsuit issue . this was actually funny and better than the hollywood comedies . well done . violence : no . sex : no . nudity : no . sex talk : yes , mostly in the beginning language : no f-bombs . a couple were heard .		7		1
somerset maugham 's characters are brought to life in rko 's `` of human bondage '' ; but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel , with bette davis ' star-making performance sucking up all of the energy . otherwise , it 's the story of leslie howard -lrb- as philip carey -rrb- ; he dreams of becoming a painter , but is told he has no talent for the arts . as the film progresses , mr. howard 's struggles , instead , to become a doctor . his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts ; though successful in medicine , his painting seemed easier - also , note the symbolism of his disability , a `` club foot '' -lrb- explained in the film -rrb- . along the way -lrb- right away , in this version -rrb- , howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis -lrb- as mildred rogers -rrb- . davis ' characterization of `` mildred '' is extraordinary , culminating in a spectacular speech , when she tells howard , among other things , that she had to `` wipe my mouth ! '' after kissing him . howard also performs well , but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis ; so , their performances are wasted . still , a film to watch for the acting , including some good supporting players . davis ' award-worthy characterization was famous for inspiring a `` write-in '' campaign for the 1934 `` best actress '' academy award . for the record , she placed third . the results were : 1 . claudette colbert - `` it happened one night '' 2 . norma shearer - `` the barretts of wimpole street '' 3 . bette davis - `` of human bondage '' 4 . grace moore - `` one night of love '' ******* of human bondage -lrb- -rrb- john cromwell ~ leslie howard , bette davis , reginald denny		7		1
there are movies that i like so much i never get tired of . i like old films -lrb- even very old ones from the 40 's , no matter if they 're colored or in black and white -rrb- . this one ? not really . after reading so much about its fame and veneered classic status , as well as seeing it so much in the lists of the best films ever and even imdb 's top 250 , i decided to give it a shot . i was lucky to find this on youtube . besides , its whole presentation on youtube is terrific , with crisp image quality instead of blurry as `` per common '' in so many films on youtube . i 'm not surprised why it got off to a bad start . i think that even in 1946 people already had the perception that this was n't such a great film . even in those days they already had much better . this one did n't age well and does n't stand the test of time . it was only some 30 years later that this film became the beloved classic it is today , all because it became a tv staple in the 70 's and 80 's christmas seasons . it 's almost as if it did n't exist before the 70 's . also , this is the film watched by the in the first two ` home alone ' movies , only dubbed in different languages -lrb- french and spanish -rrb- . this is considered a christmas film . i do n't totally agree . yes , it takes place on christmas and you see a lot of christmas decorations , christmas lights , snow and such , but it does n't feel that christmassy . in my opinion a christmas tale is supposed to bring joy and a `` feel good '' feeling . instead , this is a bitter film with a lot of unpleasant scenes . besides , with a title like that , i 'd expect a light-hearted , `` feel-good '' movie in the line of ` mary poppins ' , for example . the beginning is excellent and frankly could n't have been better : with visually delicious details such as the opening credits resembling christmas postcards , the town with its christmas decorations and lights and snow , the stars 's speech , a group of kids sliding on the ice of a frozen pond where little george bailey saves his brother 's life and the pharmacy sequence except for the disturbing part when mr. gower beats up george causing his ear to bleed after george 's heroic act . bobby anderson does a fine portrayal of little george bailey . from the moment george bailey grows up , the film slowly loses its initial greatness and excellency . james stewart 's acting is great but i think he overacts in this role . adult george bailey lacks the charm and sympathy of little george bailey . mr. potter , while well portrayed by the actor , is not a likable character , being a corrupt , despicable and malicious man . to a point , george is so frustrated and desperate that he takes it all out on his family and on a teacher by insulting her at the phone and wants to kill himself , feeling he 's more worth dead than alive and wishing he was never born at all . his savior , an angel named clarence , makes his wish come true so that he sees and experiences what would the world be like without him . and that alternative reality is creepy in many ways . to finish my long review , it 's truly a pity that the rest of the film does n't match the brilliant beginning , otherwise it could have been one of the all time greats . it had potential for that . it cost a lot to be made and it looks expensive . after filming was finished , the director considered it the best film he ever directed and even the finest film anyone ever directed . with all due respect to mr. frank capra , but i have to disagree . some things also do n't make sense . for example , adult george bailey is supposed to be around 18 or 19 years old but james stewart was nearly 40 years old when he played the role . also , when his wife announces she 's pregnant , there is n't a single scene with their kids as babies or during their first years of life and all of a sudden they 're already `` big '' . well , not `` big '' literally , but already quite some years older . and , after george wishes to `` live '' again , he wishes a merry christmas to everyone -lrb- including mr. potter -rrb- like a mad man and yells `` i 'm going to jail ! is n't that great ? '' i ca n't see how going to jail is great , but to each their own , right ?		7		1
this movie has a smart plot and good performances . tom cruise is very good as the chief john anderton . the strength of the film is that it put in doubt that people 's fate is already written and ca n't be changed . even though i liked `` minority report '' i still think that it could have been much better in a more entertaining way , i am not saying that this is a boring movie , not at all , i mean that its biggest problem is that it last too much -lrb- 145 minutes -rrb- , because of that there are certain parts that are a little boring . i think that 2 hours would have been perfect . other thing i did n't like was the lack of colors of the shots , they look too dark . the plot is about chief john anderton who catches future killers before they murder thanks to 3 people who see the murders in their dreams before they are done , but one day john anderton see in their dreams that he is one of the killers who will commit a murder . is it true or is it a set up ? , that is what he has to find out with the police after him . i recommend to see it by its special effects and smart plot .		7		1
this movie was above average , but i think the ending was too . apparently this was n't the ending in the book , and i think i would have liked the book 's ending better . no one wants to think about what david did in the end , especially , to his own son . i mean , could n't they have at least waited several hours to see if help would come . mrs. carmody was a great character , especially towards the end after she has won over most of the supermarket . she turns into the evil one . i 'm glad she got what she had coming when she started saying `` take the boy . '' other people in the store played their roles as well . they just were n't in the background . and with so many people , it was not confusing thanks to a good script . the blood and gore is more than you usually see in a stephen king film . that 's another plus for me . final verdict : one of the better horror films i 've seen in a while . much better than some slasher flick like the texas chainsaw massacre remakes . worth seeing .		7		1
phil weston -lrb- will ferrell -rrb- has been unathletic his entire life . in college he failed at every sport that he tried out for . it looks like his 10-year old son , sam -lrb- dylan mclaughlin -rrb- , is following in his footsteps . sam is riding the bench on the best soccer team in the league , which just happens to be coached by phil 's father , buck -lrb- robert duvall -rrb- . buck has been competitive his whole life and winning is everything to him . buck trades sam to the last place tigers team . the coach of the tigers quits , and phil becomes the new coach , even though he has never coached in his life . phil gets a neighbor , mike ditka of the chicago bears , to help him coach . mike recruits two italian soccer kids to the tigers . the tigers start winning , and they get to play in the championship game against buck 's team . this movie is one of those stupid and funny types . will ferrell is just as crazy as ever . the movie ends with a moral about what sports should be , and not what some sport fans think it is . you can take your children to see this movie . sit back and have a big laugh . -lrb- universal pictures , run time , rated pg -rrb- -lrb- 7/10 -rrb-		7		1
this film is well produced . it has great looks . the plot is simple and easy to follow compared with the last installment . penelope cruz is a good addition to replace keira . so why is n't the movie great ? it 's because there is no new ground broken here . almost everything that is done in this installment has been done before . there are very few surprises and nothing in action or humor that makes this movie a unique one in the series . there is one thing , at the end cruz gets a voodoo doll of sparrow . is this a thing she is going to stick pins in it and end this series ? unless we get a script that commands attention from the audience , maybe that would be a good thing . this movie has all the trappings of a hit film , but trappings are just the decor . where is the treasure ? that is what is missing here .		7		1
i 'm not a great johnny depp fan . he was ok in edward scissorhands , but whatever he does has to wipe out the memory of the mind bogglingly awful 21 jump street , so he has a way to go yet . this was silly nonsense , but i enjoyed it for that . depp is pathologist -lrb- yes , suspend any sense of reality right now ! -rrb- ichabod crane who is sent to the small town of sleepy hollow to solve the mystery of murders in which people are decapitated . without spoiling the plot there 's the compulsory love interest -lrb- ricci -rrb- , the wonderful miranda richardson as her step mother and plenty of gore and blood with the special effects of heads being removed at source . it was fun though , and does justice to one of the more famous scary stories you read as you were growing up . the headless horseman , !		7		1
`` fast food nation '' is a movie that 's mainly saved by richard linklater 's immense talent for writing dialogue , because for the most part he does n't really bring anything new here . it 's not bad , but it 's just the same as usual : characters sit around making nothing of their lives , then gradually they get caught up in each other 's story arcs somehow . i 've seen him doing it before , and i 've seen him doing it better . the main reason why `` fast food nation '' is n't really his best is because some characters just are n't very interesting . to me the most compelling character is probably the oh-so-clever marketing executive who slowly starts to grow a conscience , i reckon those segments are by far the best . the rest is surprisingly pedestrian material that does n't even hand us anything resembling closure . i know linklater has made stories that go nowhere into an art form , but here it does n't really work out because you just do n't care enough to fill in the blanks yourself . bringing in avril lavigne for a bit part also sorta reeks of stunt casting , because she sure as hell was n't hired for her acting abilities . still , you will get some brilliant lines out of this movie . it 's not quite `` dazed and confused '' , but it definitely has its moments .		7		1
like stripes -lrb- 1981 ; see review elsewhere -rrb- , i was too young to catch this adult comedy -- best-known today for being former actor howard 's sophomore directorial effort and for providing michael keaton with a star-making role . to be honest , i am rather ambivalent towards howard 's supposed talent as a film-maker : well-suited to light-hearted , life-affirming fare such as this , splash -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and cocoon -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , he has regrettably failed to convince when tackling more serious subjects . anyway , this was certainly an auspicious beginning : an original , if not exactly credible , premise wherein two morgue attendants -lrb- mild-mannered henry winkler -- howard 's from his happy days tv series -- and charismatic keaton -rrb- decide to turn their literally inert shift into a booming call-girl business ! keaton 's uncontained exuberance here may have lead to his getting the title role in beetlejuice -lrb- 1988 -rrb- but nonetheless comes across as essentially overstated ; winkler though , miles away from his iconic and fonzie character , is wonderful and he is matched by shelley long -lrb- of cheers fame , hence another established tv performer trying to break into movies -rrb- as the call-girl abused by customers -lrb- after her pimp is flamboyantly ` executed ' -rrb- who seeks comfort in the arms of neighbor winkler -lrb- himself engaged to a neurotic woman dominated by strict parents -rrb- . for all the seediness on display -lrb- involving partying in morgues , courtroom exhibitionism and exclusive sex clubs -rrb- , the film proves a generally agreeable and entertaining ride -- faltering only on occasion due to overlength -lrb- 106 minutes -rrb- . consequently , there are plentiful felicities throughout -lrb- not least an early rendition of the burt stewart song `` that 's what friends are for '' -rrb- in the way of situations -lrb- notably a involving winkler being chased by a hound let loose in the corridors of his apartment building -rrb- and dialogue -lrb- particularly when , ending up in prison and being accosted by a cellmate , winkler sarcastically thanks keaton for having made possible his acquaintance with peter lorre 's son ! -rrb- . joe spinell has a small role towards the end as the slimy manager of the swank brothel to which long relocates after her association with winkler and keaton is disrupted : the latter happens to work at the same joint as a -lrb- ! -rrb- , while the former follows her there on summing up the courage to finally express his love . by the way , a pre-stardom kevin costner can be glimpsed during the sequence !		7		1
`` deranged '' is a good early example of the serial killer exploitation film . unlike films like the later `` henry : portait of a serial killer , '' and `` dahmer , '' this 1970 's yarn almost makes a joke out of the ed gein case . it 's really funny at parts and you almost grow to like the man . right from the beginning , you know this is a twisted flick , there 's no doubt about it . the opening scene is his mother in her death bed saying some really wretched things . i liked the narrator who pops up throughout , and the music that accompanies this film . all the way up until the last few minutes , this seems like a typical tame country horror flick . the last few scenes will be etched into your mind forever . you get to see how sick this dude really is . stick with it !!! if you can , find it as a double feature with `` motel hell . '' i got the disc for 10 bucks and man was it worth every penny . 7 out of 10 , kids ,		7		1
`` is this the united states congress , or the board of directors of goldman sachs !? '' perhaps this subject is too big for one film to encapsulate , but moore has a jolly good go . he is really taking on neo-liberalism rather than capitalism itself , as he continually advocates that america should follow the european and japanese examples of more moderate , capitalism . he misses the point entirely if he characterises these economies as fundamentally ` socialist ' , when they are merely more successful capitalist societies that integrate bits of socialism in order to keep the majority happier . they are not countries which guarantee full employment or affordable homes for all , as any british or japanese citizen would be able to tell you . however , moore does capture some of the core injustices inherent in capitalism and particularly the neo-liberal economic model ; he rightly dates the advance of this model to reagan , though concedes that fdr 's dream never comes to pass . the clip of fdr , outlining his never ` second bill of rights ' is well selected and opens up some tantalising ` what-ifs ' , though clearly american individualism was always going to be too strong to succumb to his moderately socialist aims . moore covers the causes of the economic crisis adequately and graphically shows how people lost their homes and jobs so that the bankers could continue to receive bonuses once their supposedly ` free market ' businesses had been bailed out by the state . the film is very insightful on how embedded wall street and the stock market are in terms of the running of the government ; this ` elite ' being disdainfully wary of the ` peasants ' who could potentially overthrow them . moore is not critical enough of the democrats , however ; excusing their eventual caving in and support for the bail-out of the banks , and implying that the mere election of the obama is itself reason for believing that things will change . whilst 33 % of young people did indeed express faith in socialist ideas -lrb- only 4 % less than backed capitalist ones -rrb- , there is only one elected socialist senator , bernie sanders , whom moore interviews . he undercuts his own ` hope ' message by making the relevant observation that tim geithner was appointed by obama after a failed stint as regulator within the federal reserve . moore exposes the back-room deals and does concede some disillusionment with most of the elected politicians -lrb- christopher dodd , for example , is singled out -rrb- . he makes the valid point that direct action from the people is the only way to establish any gains - giving some concrete examples where or occupation of foreclosed homes , has led to some redress against the capitalist system . it is arguable whether the planet can afford for all to reap the benefits of fdr 's dream ; if it is ever to be enacted , consumerism itself must be drastically cut back . it is a self-evident truth that free market capitalism has failed not just the usa but the world , but it is far from clear that a rehashed keynesian social democrat approach is a viable alternative . moore should have spent more time honing his central argument regarding alternatives instead of the toothless attempts to make citizens arrests of the bankers ; he could have made the point that these are in effect robbers of tax-payers ' money much more succinctly . bbc documentary maker adam curtis has perhaps been the best at capturing the gaping void at the heart of neo-liberalism , in series such as `` the century of the self '' , `` the power of nightmares '' and `` the trap '' . with this film , moore has a reasonable stab at nailing it , though occasionally undermines his own case by inconsistencies and inadequately checked facts . same as ever then , but it is still good to see somebody at least trying to tackle the elephant in the room that is global capitalism and the stock market . when he is providing good evidence it is a indictment of the capitalist virus .		7		1
they released this film filmed in two versions , they acted all the scenes in both german and english , but when i decided to watch this film from the 1001 movies you must see before you die book , i was going to watch the original german language version . basically professor immanuel rath -lrb- emil jannings -rrb- is the esteemed college preparatory high school educator who has punished many of his male students for spreading around the image of beautiful stage performer lola lola -lrb- destry rides again 's marlene dietrich -rrb- . he hopes to catch the school boys in the cabaret club the blue angel , where she is the headlining act , and after her for himself he grows slowly passionate for her , and with a pair of panties snatched by a student he has a good reason to return there the following night . having had a night of desire and such , rath returns to class next day , with the principal -lrb- eduard von -rrb- furious to see the students running riot , and he is aware of the teacher 's behaviour recently as well . he decides it is best to retire from the school , and with his newfound freedom he can marry lola , but they can not stay happy for long as their money problems grow , and to earn he is forced to become a stage clown in the cabaret troupe . rath is often filled with jealousy and lust for his wife and her profession , she leaves herself open as a `` shared woman '' , and he is being ridiculed for his past while performing as a clown . he performs his last act at the blue angel , and he is shocked to see lola kissing her new love interest strongman mazeppa -lrb- hans albers -rrb- , and his rage turns into insanity , where he starts strangles his wife and is forced into a straitjacket . in the end , having been released from prison , rath is not able to resolve his position as a school teacher , and he has obviously lost wife lola , so he dies from extreme self pity clutching the school desks that once sat his loyal students . also starring kurt gerron as the magician , rosa as the magician 's wife , reinhold bernt as the clown , hans roth as beadle the caretaker of the secondary school , rolf müller as pupil angst and robert as pupil . jannings - in his first talking picture - gives a mixed but equally interesting performance as the teacher turned performer with a troubled passion , and dietrich is wonderful in her iconic top hat and black stockings as the seductive stage performer with a cruel streak , it is a film with some memorable sequences and moments that stand out , especially of course the cabaret stuff , making it a most watchable drama . very good !		7		1
another `` are we who we think we are ? '' 1999 sci-fi drama about computer matrixes that are host to our very humanity . scientist scott bierko visits a computer simulation of the 1930s in order to unlock the secret of his mentor 's murder . this leads to some rather startling revelations . bierko is sorely miscast , but he fits into the entire 30s picture quite nicely . vincent d'onofrio turns in a good performance as two separate characters related to each other via the computer world . this is an intriguing premise that would have probably been a lot more popular if not for `` the matrix '' preceding it by a few months -lrb- if memory serves me right -rrb- . in retrospect , it seems very similar , but it also seems to be coincidence . too bad the ending was so ... silly . 3.5 / 5 stars -- the 1930s evocations are the best of the entire picture . - john ulmer		7		1
` hook ' is a lively entertainer , that still has it 's own charm . directed by steven spielberg , ` hook ' acts as a sequel to peter pan 's original adventures , and comes up a winner , in it 's own way . ` hook ' synopsis : when captain hook kidnaps his children , an adult peter pan must return to neverland and reclaim his youthful spirit in order to challenge his old enemy . spielberg 's take on peter pan , is childlike & very imaginative . also , bringing in a middle-aged peter pan & a older captain hook , not only adds freshness to their legendary rivalry , but also a certain amount of inquisitiveness . his direction , like always , is gorgeous . james v. hart & malia scotch 's screenplay , is mostly engaging & lively . however , the first 30-minutes , are not really effective . cinematography & editing , are fine . art design & visual effects , are stunning . performance-wise : robin williams is lovable as peter pan . dustin hoffman performs superbly as the captain hook . julia roberts as tinker bell , does fairly well . bob hoskins as hook 's henchman , smee , is excellent . maggie smith as wendy darling is believable . all the kids deliver decently . on the whole , ` hook ' is n't a masterpiece , but throughly entertaining nonetheless . watch it !		7		1
** spoilers ** with his 15 hour tour at the san francisco hospital just ended doctor jeff cameron , robert mitchum , was on his way home to get some very needed rest when he was summoned back to the emergency room to treat this unidentified young woman who was recovering from a suicide attempt . it turns out later in the movie that the young woman , who gives dr. cameron the name margo , faith , is actually related to and living with multi-millionaire , rains , in his spacious estate outside the city . getting a telegram at the hospital to meet this mysterious margo dr. cameron falls head over heels from the beautiful and alluring brunette and even goes so far as taking her out at a swanky restaurant that evening . dr. cameron does ' t realize that she 's setting him up for the kill or for him to murdered her , as she calls him , abusive father fredrick . jeff at first thinking that fredrick is actually margo 's father , like she told him , a love-sick cameron is about to ask for his `` daughters '' hand in marriage . it 's when he 's told by a , what looks like , very amused mr. about margo 's relationship to him , she 's actually his wife , he completely loses interest . that 's when the sparks start to fly with cameron ending up with a fractured skull and mr. frederick dead after margo started to scream , when jeff left the estate , making him think that fredrick was beating her . recovering from his head injury that he received from a fireplace poker being smashed over his skull , by the late mr. , a very confused dr. cameron is persuaded by a hysterical margo to check out of the country in order to avoid being arrested by the police for her husbands ' murder . cameron who had checked just moments before after he knocked him out , in self defense , against the fireplace and found him to be unconscious but very much alive ! he 's now shocked that he all of a sudden decide to check out , by dying , altogether . jeff does n't realize that margo , who 's the person who really murdered her husband , is using him to get her out of the country and into mexico . it 's there where she has a secret bank account that 's untraceable to her as mrs. , by under her maiden name , that can put her on easy street for the rest of her life . robert mitchums best film-noir movie since `` out of the past '' back in 1947 has playing mitchum against type as the law abiding and conscientious dr. jeff cameron instead of some anti-hero type who feels that the world and cards of life are stacked against him . margo herself is not only a cold-blooded murderess but is also suffering from a severe case of paranoid schizophrenia and has become so unstable that even cameron with his head broken and slowly losing his ability , with him on the brink of suffering a fatal cerebral hemorrhage , to think correctly notices it . cameron is just too weak and hurt to do anything to help both himself as well as margo by not only having her apprehended by the police but getting her treated for her mental illness . it 's obvious from margo 's actions that she 'll eventually end up , if taken alive , in a mental hospital not a state penitentiary . powerful ending with cameron falling victim to margo 's insanity as he refuses to go along with her across the border into mexico . cameron knows that she 'll only leave him there to either rot or be arrested , by being expedited back to the usa , for a murder that he did n't commit ; that margo , who did murder frederick by suffocating him , set him up for .		7		1
the theme of the movie is not that new , but it 's refreshing to see it being used in an animated movie to such effect . it plays for the jokes and it gets the laughs . casey affleck sounds awesome and gives his character extra life . and he 's only a supporting character . just for the fact , that anna kendrick is involved , there was no chance for me not liking this , too . the ideas are good and funny and the 3-d works too . there are better animated movies when it comes to the technique , but you can still enjoy it here and there in this little movie . and do n't stop watching the when the credits start to roll ! there is a little extra scene `` hidden '' after the credits		7		1
shane black helped invent the genre as we know it today with his screenplay for `` lethal weapon '' . nearly 20 years later , perhaps feeling a bit guilty , he turns that same formula inside-out as the writer-director of the self-mocking , somewhat twisted `` kiss kiss bang bang '' . harry lockhart is a small-time crook who suddenly finds himself cast for the lead in a hollywood private-eye film . before you have a chance to grasp that implausibility , lockhart is on to another when his detective lessons with a real-life detective named gay perry -lrb- val kilmer -rrb- stick him in the middle of a real-life murder mystery involving his long-lost first love harmony -lrb- michelle monaghan -rrb- . confused ? good . you 're supposed to be . `` kiss kiss bang bang '' deliberately plays on every trope and cliché it can in a film that almost rudely aims over the heads of 90 percent of filmgoers in order to connect with film buffs and lovers of snark . it pushes spinal tap 's fine line between stupid and clever a few times but ultimately makes for a singular enjoyable experience , thanks mainly to black 's sense of style and wit and the performances of his three principals . `` my name 's harry lockhart , i 'll be your narrator , '' downey tells us at the start . `` welcome to la . . welcome to the party . '' it 's like that the whole way through . downey teases us with his winking narration while he and kilmer trade one-liners with a smoothness that borders on boredom . downey and kilmer would seem like nightmare casting from numerous perspectives , yet here they develop an on screen chemistry that plays off each other 's love for theatricality without overwhelming the affair . black 's dialogue plays expertly to their strengths , kilmer 's at being likeably obnoxious and downey 's at acting hurt but game . `` you threw my gun into the lake ? my $ 2000 ceramic my mother got me as a special gift ! '' perry fumes at one point . `` i peed on the corpse . can they do , like , an id from that ? '' harry moans a little later . monaghan is the film 's strongest asset , a hottie with a sense of humor whose performance here rivals cameron diaz 's in `` there 's something about mary '' for making all the right moves . whether laughing as downey points out the near look-alikes in a hollywood bar , crying over her sister 's sudden death , or bouncing around in a bikini santa suit , monaghan is the best thing in `` kiss kiss bang bang '' going away . what 's not as good about `` kiss kiss bang bang '' is a plot that goes off the tracks too readily and a framing narrative that plays too many games for its own good . larry miller and corbin bernsen are lost in what should be key supporting roles , and the opening credit sequence is a rather bald-faced ripoff of `` catch me if you can '' . but `` kiss kiss bang bang '' is not only entertaining and engaging , but holds up remarkably well to repeat viewings , especially if you like movies about movies .		7		1
joel and ethan coen write , produce and direct worthwhile movies that should be a crime to miss . a serious man is a black comedy , not exactly laugh-out-loud funny ... but humorous just the same . larry gopnik -lrb- michael -rrb- is a professor who 's once mundane life begins to unravel . his wife -lrb- sari lennick -rrb- is having an affair with their best friend -lrb- fred -rrb- and wants a divorce . living on the couch is larry 's inept and jobless brother -lrb- richard kind -rrb- . larry 's son -lrb- aaron wolf -rrb- is struggling at hebrew school . and at work , larry is worried about gaining tenure at the college where a foreign student is trying to bribe him for a passing grade . this serious man seems to be sabotaged by life itself . saying this film is a hoot to watch is an understatement .		7		1
okay , `` american dreamz '' is not the best movie i 've ever seen . but it did make me laugh , and it 's chock full of talent . plot : a young terrorist is assigned to blow himself up on the television show `` american dreamz '' while president staton is a judge for the show . `` american dreamz '' = `` american idol . '' president staton = george bush willem dafoe plays a dick cheney like character . hugh grant plays a simon callow like character . hugh grant , as the calculating , sadistic , game show host , shows us his inner snake , and it 's a pleasure making the snake 's acquaintance . grant is convincingly cynical , twisted , and , at a key moment , vulnerable and poignant . and always funny . aghdashloo , better known for operatic parts in serious dramas like `` house of sand and fog , '' reveals a wonderful gift for comedy . i can only hope she ever gets to play comedy again . newcomer sam golzari is a poignantly convincing `` everyman '' driven to terrorism over grief at the death of his mother . the scene where he dances to bob fosse while in a terrorist training camp is worth the price of admission . another newcomer , tony yalda , is funny , commanding , and completely believable as a young show business wannabe . his every move is perfect , even as he watches his luckier cousin perform onstage . when he catches flaws in his own technique -- as he watches himself in his full length mirror -- his look of despair at his own failings is , there 's that word again -- poignant . dennis quaid , doing a george bush imitation , somehow manages to keep his considerable sex appeal intact . how , i do n't know . chris klein , mandy moore , marcia gay harden , jennifer coolidge -- these are very talented people and they are all perfect . what is n't so great is the direction . it lacks the timing and snap of good comedic pacing . and there is a certain amount of incoherence in the script . so , yeah , the movie is n't perfect , but it dares to poke fun at topics that have us all stymied , and to earn real laughs .		7		1
it 's good every now and then to come across a film like all the real girls . here is a romance which is realistic and virtually free of gimmick and clichés . it is also photographed beautifully , scored beautifully and characterized in a unusual and interesting manner . it is a film that leaves you thinking , but for all its goodness , it still needs a bit of work . in a small town , paul has a reputation for having sex affairs with all the local girls -lrb- twenty - six to be exact -rrb- . one day , his best friend 's sister drives into town for a visit . she and paul hang out together first as friends but eventually as a strange couple . it looks as if paul is ready to go strait for the first time , something which is making his friends and family a little suspicious . what is to come ? after the first hour , all the real girls is close to being a great film , but something goes wrong . i should point out that in addition to a romance , the movie is also a drama , and dramas need a conflict of some sort . writer/director david gordon green chooses to throw one in to begin the final act , and he does it in an overly forced , abrupt manner . the scenes which follow are not terrible , but they do n't quite match the rest of the picture . they are less interesting and more melodramatic . the ending in fact is kind of sad , but it reminds you that this is not an artificial fictional story , this is a movie which delivers a potential real life scenario . ignoring the mild errors , all the real girls is one of the most accomplished romance films i 've seen lately , and it 's worth watching .		7		1
people will cast around for comparisons to explain what ` knight and day ' copies most . is it brad and angelina in mr. and mrs. smith ? not really , but certainly dozens of sources have been gleefully plundered . a close comparison is early ` bourne , ' with diaz 's franka potente to cruise 's matt damon , but with the humor , braggadocio , and indifference to logic of the original james bond stories . this couple in adversity , like the ` bourne ' one , is a linkage that comes about seemingly by accident when joan havens -lrb- diaz -rrb- happens to wind up on a nearly empty plane to kansas city that roy miller -lrb- cruise -rrb- hijacks , after its crew tries to kill him . miller is a cia man , or a former one . he 's gone rogue , or so some say . he 's also in possession of some kind of inexhaustible energy source macguffin thingie created by a brilliant teenager nerd pal of his called simon feck -lrb- paul dano -rrb- . naturally everybody wants to get hold of this thingie , and later of young simon . sarsgaard is a cia agent called fitzgerald who 's chasing roy , and his boss is a black lady called isabel -lrb- viola davis -rrb- . joan , who rebuilds classic american cars , is on her way to her sister 's wedding . the greatest tribute to roy 's skill and a sign of his attention to the human side of things is that he gets her to the wedding , after a few car explosions and chases and dozens of dead bodies . roy has two main ways of relating to people . he kisses them or he kills them . there is n't time for much else . cruise carries this off with panache . diaz is equal to the demands of her role : ditsy -- but glamorous and sexy -- blonde who 's also a charlie 's angel . when the stuff happens on the plane at the beginning , it 's not remotely believable . it is n't meant to be . how believable is any blockbuster action ? how believable is anything anywhere ? ` knight and day ' establishes right away -lrb- watch how the plane rocks when there 's turbulence -rrb- that this is a garish , over-the-top comedy . the ridiculous opening sequence clearly establishes that this is an outrageous comedy -- and a romance -- as much as it 's an actioner . the filmmakers are simply betting that the vivacity of the action and the charm of the stars will get you involved and that involvement will grow rather than diminish as the story progresses . the action is preposterous , but the protagonists are in trouble , so you forget it 's silly and start to worry -- but you do n't forget to laugh , and you 're meant to . the movie manages to ramp up all three aspects and keep the cocktail stirred . this is a shameless effort to appeal simultaneously to three different genre demographics : comedy , action , romance . and it just may succeed . is this ron miller -lrb- tom cruise -rrb- a man on a crucial mission -- or an out-of-control nut case ? this is the question this movie poses , and this is a role that both cruise 's friends and his enemies may find appropriate ... but to stick with this movie and enjoy its wild ride , you need to set aside any feelings the actor 's antics may have awakened and focus on the great movies he has been in , observe how well he and ace comedienne cameron diaz work together , and there 's entertainment to be had here . ` knight and day ' is completely empty and pointless , but also quite a lot of fun . it 's too long -lrb- like so many of the new pictures -rrb- , and contains such a rich , indigestible mélange of action stuff -- somersaulting cars exploding on highways , shootouts , chases , fires -- and such lush locations , including pamplona at bull run time , picturesque austrian towns , langley , and the orient express , you feel overfed . but then you walk out and it 's all , pleasantly , forgotten , except for tom cruise 's manic smile and cameron diaz 's look of wide-eyed astonishment , which are enough to take home from a summer blockbuster in a season when one of the ny times ' lead critics praises jonah hex and pixar 's strung-out third installment of toy story is hailed as a masterpiece . empty of solid content though it may be , ` knight and day ' succeeds , for one thing , because it does something woefully lacking in today 's blockbusters -- alternates the heavy action with quiet times . here , they 're usually romantic pauses , in which the lady -lrb- diaz -rrb- changes into something more comfortable . joe carnahan , who has a sense of humor and knows his way around tough-guy scenes , should have kept this in mind when he made ` the a-team , ' a movie that never lets up and consequently leaves you just feeling weary . you remember nothing but liam neeson puffing on cigars in a movie he should never have been in . ` knight and day ' has sense enough to give its leads appropriate roles and let you catch your breath every now and then . in development , this movie went through various titles ; the one it landed with , ` knight and day , ' only makes sense at the end and even then wo n't hit you over the head with its logic . ' k & d' also went through many writers -- at least nine . considering that , it 's a tribute to director and cast that the whole thing hangs together as well as it does and the different sequences do n't just feel like pieces in a disassembled puzzle . tom cruise 's character is invincible and his accidental partner , joan , tends to get overexcited or lose her ability to cope with the gangs of assassins , the car chases , and the explosions and roy resorts to drugging her so he can whisk them both safely away . from being scared and dubious , joan begins to have more and more confidence in roy and as this turns to attraction she shows startling abilities of her own : `` you 've got skills , '' roy tells her . indeed . and however preposterous , so does ` knight and day .

the constant gardner disappointed me a little . i mean i do n't know what i was expecting and being it has critics raving and rumors of academy award nominations i should have known it would n't be quite as action packed and mainstreamed as the dvd box cover would have me believe but i picked it up anyways and i have to say i think i believe firmly that the constant gardner is probably one of the most intellectual films i have ever watched . in what appears to be his first english film brazillian director fernando meirelles makes a film that is controversial and interesting , with a conspiracy theory story line unlike anything else . for the real intellectual film goer , this one has to be absolute gold !! i do n't mean to say it had no entertainment value , only that for the majority of the mainstream public they wo n't like it , which says more about their level of attention than the films -lrb- including me i think . -rrb- ralph fiennes is terrific , and captivating as uk diplomat justin quayle whose wife is brutally tortured and murdered in a seemingly random attack . but as he digs deeper into his wife 's life he discovers that she was onto something far bigger . she was desperately hunting down an enormous pharmaceutical company that is testing a dangerous , even deadly , tb drug on african citizens who in their opinion are dispensable . at first it would appear that his wife was perhaps unfaithful , unmoral and involved with other men but as the story unfolds he discovers his wife 's very deep love for him and for the african people and her desire to do the right thing . fiennes does a very deep and emotional role as the haunted widower , and the investigator and he 's interesting enough to watch . apparently rachel weisz is getting all the love and hype playing fiennes feisty wife tessa . she is good , and weisz has been good for a long time , her performances are always very well done , but i do n't think constant gardner is her best work by a long stretch . her performance is very good , very real and convincing and you really believe she is heart strong about her cause but she 's only , at best , supporting fiennes character , as her own character is killed off early in the film . the rest of the supporting cast performs their parts admirably but no one stands out quite as much as fiennes and weisz . screenplay writer jeffrey caine does a terrific job as firmly establishing their relationship , how they met , their quick marriage and their love and respect for each other to truly understand quayle 's intense mission to finish his wife 's wishes . their chemistry together is very good , and their love story very passionate especially as it unfolds through him discovering possible infidelity to discovering that 's not the case at all ... he falls in love with her all over again . the story is where the intellectual part comes in . it 's the kind of story that could have been done with bruce willis or sly stallone directed by jerry bruckheimer in an hour and a half with things blowing up everywhere but it 's not done like that at all . instead it 's done with such shocking reality , and a twisted plot about a intricate conspiracy that unfolds each minute right up to the very last of the film . i found the last half of the movie far more interesting than the first but it still unfolds at a very slow speed and although beautifully filmed in kenya the setting does n't change much so it makes for a little less interesting . it all rests on fiennes to keep things interesting and while he 's very good at this role , it 's not meant to be intensely entertaining but deliver a very real message . so if you want true artistic masterpiece with a real intellect to it you 'll love the constant gardner and i am sure that it will bring home the awards or at the very least nominations . 7/10		7		1
castle 's most mature effort remains gimmicky and silly in spots . overall , though , it is a neatly accomplished effort to resurrect the ` old dark house ' murder mystery of the 30s and 40s , a genre that pretty much came to an end after the second world war . the house itself is something of a disappointment - the house in castle 's `` 13 ghosts '' seems more complicated and stranger than the art-deco job we 've got here , and the interiors are pretty banal . but the characters are rather interesting , and for the most part believable given their biographies - and well acted throughout , especially by cook jr. and vincent price at his most sophisticated . remembering that this is really a murder mystery , not a horror film , do n't expect big shocks - pay attention to the puzzles . admittedly a bit slow , but surprisingly entertaining .		7		1
by reading all the varied opinions of the effect this film has on viewers , one can easily deduce it 's power to attract or repel , depending on the viewer 's cultural background -- do you want a film that pushes the envelope or a more traditional take , well-made but linear ? moulin rouge is in no way traditional , and therein lies it 's strength for many viewers , perhaps especially for those raised on television commercials and the toys of instant communication , where a frequent change of focus is stimulating rather than irritating . as with director luhrmann 's recent gatsby film , the style here is the primary substance , a delirious mix of color , sound and attitude in brilliant color that never lets a moment go by without a camera zoom or background flourish ; the first time i watched this strange amalgam of red and gold curtained style , i was ready for a tylenol , mainly because i wanted some sort of coherent plot , some feeling to hang on to -- every time luhrmann hooks the viewer into an emotional moment , he whips it into something else entirely , like throwing 237 vivid mtv shorts into a blender and churning it on crumble : the second time i watched it merely for the sensual thrills -lrb- as the plot is high-school simple -rrb- and enjoyed the ride . there is little doubt that luhrmann is able to make a dazzling film , but whether he delivers any kind of depth in human relationships or feeling is another matter entirely .		7		1
as i sit here and try to collect my thoughts about this film , i find myself drifting to the above question : `` what is all the hype about ? '' i just do n't get this movie ... a former cop , a former friend , and a couple of feds get together and through the use of some fast cars -lrb- and some , obviously -rrb- try to bring down the bad guy . i did n't believe one minute of it . but , then , like the saying goes : `` only in hollywood ... '' the first movie was great ! i 've seen it three times ! i 'm going to watch it again tomorrow night ! vin diesel is a very good actor , but i truly believe that his character is what made the first movie , because we definitely did not see any of it here .		7		1
eye - pleasing , classic horror references thrown in and most importantly entertaining for it 's target audience , paranorman does almost everything right to make it a family fun film . it took a while for the film to get going , with the opening half an hour focusing strongly on the main character , norman babcock -lrb- who reminds me of a young odd thomas . -rrb- this leads to my only criticism . the main story plot does n't come into full focus until the final half an hour , resulting with the first hour being nothing much but eye candy and sporadic laughs . but the film plods along nicely , never stalling or steering of . the pivotal characters mix in with one another pleasantly , -lrb- norman 's father however has to be the worst father in a kid 's film ever -rrb- and best of all , the film is wonderfully pretty . add the excellent soundtrack and yeah , paranorman does everything almost right .		7		1
after countless terrible king adaptations , darabont has really done something awesome with the mist . i absolutely loved this movie and am very satisfied with the adaptation . i was actually terrified the whole time and then at the end , i was so utterly shocked that i had to just sit there and stare at the screen while the credits continued to roll . i ca n't give it away but it will blow your mind ! the acting is very solid the whole time with power house performances from thomas jane , marcia gay harden and andre braugher . i loved the story and was genuinely creeped out by it the entire time . there is great gore and some great creatures , however , i felt that the cgi bogged these down a bit , but that 's the only thing i can really complain about . otherwise , it 's a brilliant horror film . horror fans owe it to themselves to check out the mist . it 's an essential for anyone who gets there kicks from being scared . see it as so as you possibly can !		9		1
successful movie franchises usually tend to start of with a bang , only to slowly fade out like a candle with every new installment . `` naked gun '' however , it just kept getting better and better . the original was funny , so was 2 1/2 , but to me 33 1/3 is really the one that never gets old . so many classic leslie nielsen scenes in this one , so many great quotes . the structure -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- is similar to that of the first two , but the finale at the oscars is by far my favorite of the three . the movie 's also tightly paced , it does n't go on for any longer than it needs to . it 's not that the others are boring , but there 's still a noticeable difference . many disagree with this , but to me `` the final insult '' will always be leslie nielsen at his absolute peak . he has his character down to a tee here , too bad he did n't get better scripts in his later days . but oh well , i can always watch this one again .		9		1
brian de palma 's ` femme fatale ' is pure movie-making . in fact , it is done so well you almost forget it is all close to nonsense . but who cares , ` femme fatale ' is an exercise in style drenched in twists and turns . instead of cheating de palma gives us a lot of little hints , easily missed the first time you see it . explaining the story could ruin a lot and is probably useless anyway . i can tell the film opens with a heist , probably one of the most erotic ones out there . laure ash -lrb- rebecca romijn-stamos -rrb- is the one who goes away with a very expensive artifact betraying a whole lot of people . this event is what drives her the rest of the movie , but in what way i can not reveal . i can say that we move forward to seven years later and that laure has changed her identity , more by mistake than on purpose . another important thing i can tell you is that we meet a photographer named nicolas bardo -lrb- antonio banderas -rrb- . he takes a picture of laure while she is still laure and he is the one who takes a picture of her seven years later , a photo that could spoil everything for her . i should stop talking about the story . you have to see it for yourself , collecting clues and try to make something out of it . i love a movie like this . ` memento ' , ` mulholland dr. ' and ` donnie darko ' are other examples . maybe you can figure them out , if that is the filmmakers intention , maybe you can not . but it is not so much the conclusion i enjoy , it is the ride that brings us there . de palma does it in a terrific way with a lot of love for the movies .		9		1
in the 90 's there was a string of remakes following the classic universal monsters : dracula -lrb- bram stoker 's dracula -rrb- , the wolf man -lrb- wolf -rrb- , the mummy -lrb- the mummy -rrb- and frankenstein -lrb- mary shelley 's frankenstein -rrb- . sadly this is a more overlooked remake that i feel is a very strong movie . not to deny any praise to the original frankenstein from the 30 's , boris karloff 's performance is still one of the best and it 's still a very scary movie . but there was no frankenstein film to come out that would remain true to it 's original story . in high school we read frankenstein and it brought up so many interesting conflicts , where do you draw the line between living and playing god ? was victor responsible for elizabeth 's death ? was the creature really a monster or just a victim ? kenneth branagh took on this story and did an absolutely wonderful job . victor frankenstein is the son of the wealthy baron and caroline frankenstein . at one point in his childhood victor 's parents adopted elizabeth , who would become the love of victor 's life . years later victor 's mother dies giving birth to his brother william . sometime before going off to the university , a grief-stricken victor vows on his mother 's grave that he will find a way to conquer death . on the night of his graduation victor and elizabeth promised to wed when victor returns from his studies . he finds a friend in henry clerval and a mentor . victor comes to believe that the only way to cheat death is to create life . victor spends months in his apartment working on creating a living , breathing creature . using dead body parts from various sources , he begins piecing a creature together . late one night victor finally gives his creation life , but he recoils from it in horror and renounces his experiments . but it might be too late for him to take back what he should n't have messed with in the first place . robert deniro did a great job playing the creature , what a heartbreaking role to take on and he plays it with such amazing sympathy . he says to victor `` did you ever consider the consequences of your actions ? you made me , and you left me to die . who am i ? '' and you seriously feel so much for him , he is the true victim . as in the book and not in the original movie , victor does feel like a god when he is doing his experiments , but when he succeeds , he regrets it immediately . kenneth did a wonderful job taking on this complicated man who is n't evil by any means but a victim of his own intelligence and wanting to cheat death . the supporting cast is wonderful with helena bonham carter and tom hulce . the film can be a little over the top at times playing like a soap opera , but when i read the book , that 's how i felt about the story as well . the sets , the costumes and the make are just incredible . frankenstein is an underrated gem and deserves a better look . it 's one of the most intelligent horror stories of all time , kenneth put a lot of love into this film and i think mary shelley would be proud . 9/10		9		1
chicago -lrb- 4 + outta 5 stars -rrb- yeah , i was ticked off when `` chicago '' won the oscar for best picture instead of `` the pianist '' ... i was prepared to not like this movie for that reason alone . -lrb- and because i was a big bob fosse fan , i was n't prepared to like a movie that was mere `` '' but ... i liked it !!! i liked it !!! the music and the performances are top notch ... at least as far as the female cast goes ... richard gere , well , he does a good job but the ladies -lrb- catherine zeta-jones , renee zellwegger and queen latifah -rrb- are sooooooooooooo good that he sort of pales by comparison . the movie does n't have a dull moment ... one incredible song-and-dance number after another ... woo hoo ! the only flaw in the movie is that i do n't think the later climactic songs are as good as some of the earlier show-stoppers ... the trial needed a big finish and it just did n't quite have it . still , that 's a minor point . weeks later and i 'm still humming the songs ! -lrb- also , as much as i love this movie ... it 's still only the second best musical released in 2002 ... i still prefer 8 women ... but just barely . -rrb-		9		1
i went and saw this new thriller from director denis villenueve . a lot of different things about it made me interested despite the fact that i have n't seen the director 's other films on his resumé . prisoners begins with keller and grace dover -lrb- hugh jackman and maria bello -rrb- , who live in the small town in pennsylvania . they are taking their son and daughter to visit the birch family headed by franklin and nancy -lrb- terrence howard and viola davis -rrb- for thanksgiving . while there , the youngest daughters , anna and joy , go around the neighborhood and mess around on an rv , before their siblings make them stop . later , anna and joy go outside again and do n't return , which causes immediate panic for the dovers and birches . at the same time , detective loki -lrb- jake gyllenhaal -rrb- is eating alone at a chinese restaurant when he gets a call about a suspicious rv at a nearby rest stop . loki takes the call and other cops show up . the driver of the rv is alex jones -lrb- paul dano -rrb- and he is immediately a suspect in kidnapping anna and joy . loki does not play around when interrogating alex as he thinks alex is guilty . however , the rv is clean in the sense that there is no evidence to arrest alex. alex is let go , and keller is not happy about this as he also strongly believes alex to be guilty . keller does everything he can to track down the girls . grace is worried sick for her girl , literally . the birches are also very worried . loki must do everything in his power to track the girls ' kidnapper and safely have them returned home before its too late . denis villenueve does an excellent job with handling this dramatic and chilling material . he created some powerful and emotional scenes with the shot lists he has put together . villenueve has does a nice job at keeping the story moving forward while making this very emotional for the audience . aaron guzikowski wrote the screenplay here , and does a nice job of writing a dark , gritty , chilling script . guzikowski does a nice job at making some plot twists i was not expecting . the only fault i point out on denis villenueve and aaron guzikowski is the ending is iffy , but the film overall is very well done thanks to the director and writer . jake gyllenhaal gives a very powerful performance as detective loki . he does a great job at showing a man who cares about the job at hand and will do anything to solve this case and have the girls safely returned home . loki is a hard worker and gyllenhall gives the best performance of his career . hugh jackman also does great work as keller dover . with this role , jackman is very raw and emotional as a religious man and loving father who will also stop at nothing until his daughter is home safe and sound . jackman gives one of the best performances in his career in this film . of the supporting cast , maria bello is the standout as the worried , sick mother literally . despite having limited screen time , bello makes the most of her role as she is told by her husband to stay home and get better . she is even suspicious when some unusual activity happens in her house that makes her wonder if it 's anna . terrence howard and viola davis do some nice and emotional work here as the birches . howard has a bit more to do than davis , but does great job at acting with his facial expressions . a surprising performance to me was melissa leo as alex jones 's aunt . she is great at playing like nothing 's wrong , despite her nephew being highly accused of being a kidnapper . paul dano even does a surprising job as the guy suspected of kidnapping and is good at playing the dumb guy who does n't know what anyone is talking about . from a technical aspect , the best is the camera work by dp roger deakins . deakins really is the best dp out there and knows very well how to get the shots his directors want and his brilliant use of lighting . i also quite enjoyed the editing by longtime clint eastwood collaborators joel cox and gary roach . i even thought the production design by patrice .		9		1
finally after all these years i decided to set down and watch the frank capra classic from 1946 `` it 's a wonderful life '' and i must say overall i was well pleased a film that makes one feel down and depressed yet it touches your emotions and makes you be thankful especially the way the film ends it can bring your eyes to water up . the legendary jimmy stewart who performs fine here plays george bailey a man who thru life has always seemed to have gotten the short end . from his days as a child when george felt guilty for not watching his brother to the days of never reaching his full potential and having to take over the business of banking loans once his father passes unexpectedly . it seems that george 's life is problem after problem even after he enjoys life with his significant other mary -lrb- donna reed -rrb- then his business sinks and the loans of bank customers turn to debt and it seems life for george is now finally doomed as if he will be broken just before christmas . all along from the films start we as the viewer can see somewhat of a foreshadowing technique starting out with the stars in the sky of angels up above who keep a close eye on everyone including george . then upon christmas as in so many holiday fairy types a magical visit occurs this time it 's from an angel named clarence . the journey that george takes is even more depressing , but in the end he sees the true light and love from everyone in town . capra really proved with this film that no matter how bad it seems or it gets in life that in the end if you have loved and given friends will turn out in the end in time of need and not let failure or darkness happen . many times some of us are n't felt to be loved or liked , but we are fooled and surprised in the end with a little help from up above . the ending with the bell and angel is timeless and a classic well remembered by most viewers . clearly thumbs up for frank capra who made an emotional and touching classic with a little help from the angels in the heavens above it touches a viewer and makes them feel loved and uplifts their spirits .		9		1
crouching tiger , hidden dragon is a masterful directorial effort by ang lee that is a beautiful film and is bound to sweep you off your feet . i have n't seen many foreign films up to this point , but i think now i shall . this film weaves a story and it feels like you 're part of the story . the language barrier did not hold me back , and i felt like i was in 19th-century china part of this story . this movie is beautifully shot and features some of the best cinematography i have seen in film . ang lee , who directed such american classics like brokeback mountain and life of pi , directs a chinese narrative that takes place during the reign of the emperor . li mu bai 's master was murdered by the jade fox and as he is about to retire , he finds out he has another chance to avenge his master 's death . this film features some great acting by very talented international actors . chow yun-fat is very good in his role and he should be , since he 's one of china 's best actors . michelle yeoh delivers a convincing performance as fat 's lover . finally , zhang ziyi is very good in her role and delivers quite an emotional punch . overall , this is a very beautiful film both story-wise and to look at . the film will make you seem as if you 're in the story . sure , the story can get silly sometimes , but most martial arts films do . the choreography is excellent and sometimes is very matrix-like . the score is wonderful and exquisite . this is an action film , but there is plenty of substance here and there is definitely a great story being told . you can tell this film is in the hands of a talented director . very well done ! i rate this film 9/10 .		9		1
seven years into their screen partnership , spencer tracy and katharine hepburn made what is arguably their best effort together , the sixth of nine movies they made together . the zingy repartee and comfort in their relationship are in full bloom in this 1949 comedy classic directed by george cukor . written by the legendary husband and wife writing team of garson kanin and ruth gordon , the plot focuses on a court case involving doris attinger , a dim-witted wife who shoots her philandering husband warren just as he is caught with his blowsy mistress beryl . representing the wounded husband is assistant da adam bonner who is looking for a quick conviction of the wife . however , his proto-feminist attorney wife amanda sees the alleged crime as an act of justifiable defiance and decides to defend the wife . this potentially tense set-up leads to a trial where amanda sets out to prove that a double standard exists for women and that doris was merely defending her family and home . adam , however , believes that the law is the law no matter the gender of those involved and that a murder was indeed attempted . consequently , the story is not so much about adam 's inherent sexism as it is about amanda 's single-minded determination to prove her point even as the case degrades into a media sideshow . over half a century later , amanda 's arguments sound rather dated , one-note and frankly ill-conceived with many of her lines simply polemics . at the same time , hepburn plays such a convincing litigator that her case actually sounds persuasive at times . tracy is also in top form as he brings his unique combination of sympathy and combustible bluster to a man who respects his wife deeply but becomes increasingly disillusioned with her unlawful stance . together , they banter terrifically throughout , but it 's in the domestic scenes , for instance , the home movie of their connecticut farm and the late night meal preparation , where you feel their natural chemistry the most . as doris , judy holliday delivers in her first significant screen role , bringing a deeper pathos to the scorned wife than you would expect . several years away from `` the seven year itch '' , tom ewell plays warren for the smarmy , sexist cheater that he is , while jean hagen expertly plays beryl as a floozy . as the bonners ' next door neighbor kip , david wayne acts rather fey for someone who supposedly wants to run away with amanda , but i suppose the approach was intentional to ensure nothing would really threaten the bonner marriage except the case . however dated some of the sexual politics feel , the film is still one of the most smartly played of romantic comedies . unfortunately the 2000 dvd has no extras .		9		1
witness is first and foremost an electrifying and poignant love story , but it 's also a very good thriller . it is a film about adults , whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them . the story focuses on a detective -lrb- harrison ford -rrb- protecting a young amish boy who becomes the target of a ruthless killer after he witnesses a brutal murder in philadelphia 's 30th street train station . witness is as much about the meeting of cultures as about cops and robbers , this is one of those lucky movies which works out well on all counts and shows that there are still craftsmen lurking in hollywood . the film is powerful , assured , full of beautiful imagery and devoid of easy moralising , which is good . harrison ford offers a performance of surprising skill and sensitivity . witness is also notable as the screen debut of future star viggo mortensen .		9		1
summer is usually the time for big loud action-packed blockbusters like this , but let us tell you right at the start that none of the bombast we 've seen this summer compares to what lies in store for you in the fourth big-screen adaptation of the 1970s television series . this is hands-down the best action film this year , boasting some of the most exhilarating action ever captured in a long while . it also restores tom cruise 's marquee value as an action star , and we dare attest that any naysayer to cruise 's ability to resurrect the franchise he almost drowned will be silenced once they see what he does on screen . indeed , the last ` mission : impossible '' from ` alias ' and ` lost ' creator j.j. abrams was then easily the best of the series - though all that positive word about it could n't quite triumph the bad press surrounding its star and producer cruise 's erratic behaviour . so ` mi3 ' ended up hitting a nadir for the franchise at the box-office , and cruise 's star wattage has never since fully rebounded . trying to restore its lustre was n't a mission impossible , but it was going to be an uphill task as well - if not only for the fact that it had to better j.j. abrams ' solid work . that gamble has however paid off with an unlikely bet - choosing animation hero brad bird from ` the iron giant ' and ` ratatouille ' to make his first live-action film . bird is also of course the director of pixar 's ` the incredibles ' and there is certainly the same pulsating energy running through every frame of ` mi4 ' . from the very beginning , bird places his definitive stamp on the series with a classy opening that sees imf operative ethan hunt breaking out of a russian prison . that sequence , which combines dean martin 's ` ai n't that a kick in the head ' with steve mcqueen 's ` the great escape ' , is carefully executed and fluidly filmed - and both are signature attributes of bird 's style throughout the movie . no ` mission impossible ' film would be complete without the exotic locales , fancy gadgets and big explosions - but there is a certain finesse by which bird assembles all these elements together into one package . so even as the setting moves from russia to dubai to mumbai , even as the gadgets grow increasingly fanciful -lrb- one especially nifty device is a nifty mirror-like screen -rrb- and even as the explosions get more colossal -lrb- how about blowing up the kremlin ? -rrb- , bird never lets the adventure get frenetic , alternating confidently between quiet tension and full-blown action to keep you on the edge of your seat . riveted is what you 'll be as hunt and his team infiltrates the kremlin to steal some classified intel about the russian extremist kurt hendricks -lrb- swedish actor michael nyqvist from ` the girl with the dragon tattoo ' -rrb- , then hoodwinks two sets of bad guys just one floor apart atop the burj khalifa , and then races against time literally in the crowded streets of mumbai to stop hendricks from precipitating an all-out nuclear war between the united states and russia . each elaborate setpiece is in itself a spectacle , and watching them unfold one after another quite simply takes your breath away . but the most awe-inspiring - and worthy of singular mention - setpiece is cruise 's vertiginous climb up the glass exterior of the burj khalifa using suction gloves . it is cruise himself way up on the floor , and the authenticity of it shows in every second of robert elswit 's breathtaking cinematography that is enough reason alone to catch this in imax . it is even more heart-stopping than you can imagine , not least when cruise is left dangling with just one glove after the other malfunctions . nothing else quite comes close to the sheer dizzying excitement of this sequence - not even the intensely gripping race - climax with a good-old fistfight between hunt and hendricks in an automated parking garage . yes , cruise is n't one to rest on his laurels , and at the age of 49 , the extent to which he commits to perform the stunts in this movie by himself is simply amazing . when he is not attempting some death-defying move in the air or for that matter on the ground , cruise uses his immense charisma to deliver a slickly captivating performance as the leader of the disavowed imf . he also enjoys great chemistry with his supporting players - the tech whiz benji dunn -lrb- simon pegg -rrb- , the tough sexy female player jane carter -lrb- paula patton -rrb- and last but not least the enigmatic analyst william brandt -lrb- jeremy renner -rrb- . the banter between cruise and pegg is particularly enjoyable , the source of most of the movie 's comic relief . their wisecracks may at first seem at odds with the gravity of the situation at stake , but ultimately these lighter moments provide a light zesty touch that ensures the movie does n't sink into its own self - seriousness . besides these instants of levity , the script by josh appelbaum and andre nemec works hard to spin an intriguing espionage plot amidst the action set-pieces that harks back to the cold war - though admittedly their most glaring failure is in creating a more compelling villain than simply another madman bent on world destruction . they fare much better drawing links between this instalment and j.j. abrams ' last , especially in explaining hunt 's absence from duty as well as brandt 's mysterious past . still , story is n't its strong suite , and bird knows that well enough to keep most of his cards close and revealing just enough clues to keep his audience hooked . but the ` mission impossible ' films were always going to be about delivering thrilling blockbuster entertainment , and it is in this regard that bird truly shines . to say that the action on display is exhilarating is merely an understatement , and let us reassure you that the extra bucks you will shell for an imax ticket is worth every additional cent . it is quite simply the best ` mission impossible ' entry yet , and the best action film you 'll ever see this year .		9		1
in ` the mission ' roland joffé has succeeded in putting together one of the most majestic visual adventures of all time : and a story that had to be told . chris menges ' sumptuous photography is a feast , such that -- for once -- the newsweek quotation on the video cover is superbly apt : ` a sweeping spectacle ' . the whole film is breathtaking : from the depths of the jungle to the indian villages , from face close-ups to broad panoramas , the visual effects are so powerful that i just can not think of any other comparable film . add to that fine interpretations , carefully considered and delivered performances by all concerned with joffé 's exquisite direction , and you have a guarantee of a magnificent production . but that is not all there is to this great film : ennio morricone 's music reaches its greatest power , its most poignant intensity , its most gratifying melodic line , right here in ` the mission ' , surpassing everything this italian composer had ever done before -- even with his great friend , sergio leone . here morricone reaches symphonic levels in a wealth of melodic harmonies , such that what is supposedly ` only ' a visual attraction -- a film -- becomes also a delight to the ears , bringing a lump to my throat at various moments through this genuinely mighty film . you might wish to compare this film with ` 1492 : a conquest of paradise ' -lrb- 1992 -rrb- in which the best of vangelis can be heard ; but even so , i rate ` the mission ' just ahead of ` 1492 ' . both films highly recommendable .		9		1
what a movie ! what a fabulous movie ! steven spielberg does it once again with `` jurassic park . '' he proves that he can do anything and that dinosaurs were n't monsters , they were animals . it may not be accurate to the book , but it 's still a masterpiece . in case you do n't know what it 's about , it 's about the idea of genetically enhanced dinosaurs who are engineered to be harmless , and how a group of scientists are invited to see them and judge them on how safe and how real they are . but , something goes wrong ... and that 's where the action comes in . one thing that i liked was jeff goldblum . he was always my favorite actor . i find him to be a natural actor and the way he delivers his lines is great . it 's like he 's not even sticking to the script , he 's just making it up as he goes along . also , a beautiful score by john williams . you ca n't get better than that .		9		1
joey gazelle -lrb- paul walker -rrb- and his partners , sal -lrb- michael cudlitz -rrb- and tommy -lrb- johnny messner -rrb- accidentally kill a cop after a dealing goes wrong . when tommy gives joey the get rid of , joey finds out it wo n't be a walk in the park . his next door neighbor , oleg -lrb- cameron bright -rrb- , who 's best friends with joey 's son , nicky -lrb- alex neuberger -rrb- takes the gun and uses it on his step-father , anzor -lrb- karel roden -rrb- . oleg flees the scene and a corrupt detective , rydell -lrb- chazz palminteri -rrb- , obsessed with finding the gun first , goes on the hunt against joey . will the cops find it first ? will the mafia find out joey 's mistake ? it 's all loaded with non-stop action that keeps you on the edge of your seat ! i enjoyed the movie from the opening gun play because it was n't anything i 'd ever seen before in film . though , the film spews out over 400 profanities -lrb- being the f bombs -rrb- , the films plot and action are able to keep your mind focused . i absolutely love the story ! i never seen paul walker in anything but `` fast and the furious '' but i thought he was terrific . paul is n't the only great thing , vera farmiga , who plays his wife is also able to hold her own on the action scene . with such a wide range of actors from all ends known to unknown and playing their roles so well , the action , the gore and the fact that it 's mafia pitted against the cops , this movie goes a long way to pleasing everyone . there 's a point in the movie i ca n't seem to watch unless it 's through my fingers , which is how everyone else watches the scene , but yet it 's such an amazing scene . this film really showed me how good acting is done . it shows you the side of the mafia you do n't get to see in most films . it shows you how messed up with world is . above all , it shows what lengths a man will go to , to save his family . it 's an inspirational movie even though it 's dark , gritty and rated r.		9		1
and finally they did it right this time ! `` tron : legacy '' surprised me a lot , leaving the trauma of seeing the first disappointing episode miles away . it 's like comparing the number 8 with 80 , very different from each other and it is so good that a sequel might be coming real soon . call me crazy but this one really deserves all the stars and the possible praise it can get . light years ahead from the 1982 original film , `` tron : legacy '' is all about evolution , on-screen and off-screen . what has changed in the world during the lapse of time both tron films were made -lrb- 28 years to be more precise -rrb- , and why the successful 2010 film is more appealing and more relevant than the previous box-office failure of the 1980 's ? back then , `` tron '' presented a whole new world that very few people had access into , the computer technology , programs and games , all in the early stages of development , just crawling . it was one of the first films to use new technological special effects , very close to what cgi is now -lrb- or some might say that it was cgi 's first age -rrb- . it was a film a little ahead of its time , difficult to understand and to make us involved with all those technical terms about computers and all , and audiences were n't interested in that . even now , it 's not much of a good film to watch , in fact , it 's incredibly tedious but visually fascinating with those colorful clothes imitating computer chips . it 's a cult film to some and i 'm probably one of the very few who really did n't care much for it . a few decades later , technology is accessible and known to almost everybody , we do n't crawl anymore , we 're almost flying , that 's how big we evolved with new electronic medias that change each month . with all that in mind is that this sequel , taking characters and the concept of the original film , was far more interesting , relevant and dazzling than the other movie . `` legacy '' is exciting , simplified , dynamic and powerfully efficient . works perfectly as an sci-fi adventure flick , and also as dramatic piece . now it 's time for sam flynn -lrb- garrett hedlund -rrb- , the son of kevin flynn -lrb- jeff bridges -rrb- to enter into the world of fierce programs and dangerous games inside of an old arcade machine to rescue his father , trapped there since 1989 . themes like friendship , loyalty to family , greed are worked amidst programs fights , chases , duels between creator and creature -lrb- clu , also played by bridges , practically photoshopped to , at the age of 61 looks like he 's 31 -rrb- . the coolest aspect of the first episode and that remains here is the style of the programs , the brilliant thematic costumes and the art-direction mixed with the greatest visual effects of the moment . no more of those dated and cheesy effects . and one special mention to the amazing soundtrack composed by daft punk -lrb- who has a cameo -rrb- that really makes the film more enjoyable . getting wrong with one or two ideas but without making its audience bored or uninterested , `` tron : legacy '' is a very good film , the technical aspects of it are incredibly well-made , the story is pretty decent -lrb- did n't like the ending though , i was expecting a little bit more from it -rrb- and the actors gathered here do a nice job , bridges , hedlund , bruce boxleitner returning as alan , olivia wilde , james frain , michael sheen and jeffrey nordling , all good . surprises me the fact disney wanted to invest on a sequel of a film that was a failure to them a long time ago and surprises me once again that they selected a first time director to do the job , but joseph kosinski deserves some good credit for it , making a better work than steve lisberger -lrb- who produced this one -rrb- did . it 's very rare sequels getting so much improvement , as if a first film were never made . so , i would n't mind seeing a third installment for the tron series . if get this good , i 'll watch it right away . 9/10		9		1
i just saw this film last night for the first time in my life . i have to say that it was a wonderful experience and i am certainly going to buy it . the whole production was perfect : the screenplay , the directing , even the special effects still look somewhat cool even though they could make them way more realistic today . however , it would be very wrong to remake this film . its very much like `` casablanca '' , or `` citizen kane '' . you ca n't remake them because they are perfect as is . all of the elements needed to make a good film came together here and the result is one of the best and most popular films of all time . truly , there is no place like home .		9		1
` the big sleep ' seems ten times as complicated as ` the maltese falcon ; ' to some people , that makes it a greater cinematic delight , to others , a slightly lesser one . there is a legend going around that , even if it 's not true , is fun to believe - that the star , director , and even the writer were uncertain about whether one of the deaths in the film was a suicide or murder , and if it was a murder , who committed it . after seeing ` the big sleep , ' i am inclined to believe it . unless you almost literally take notes while watching it , after a certain point your brain just stops trying to keep track of all the persons seen or referred to , on screen and off , who killed whom and who is getting the blame and where the hell sean regan is . there are three people that you end up caring about - philip marlowe -lrb- humphrey bogart -rrb- , vivian -lrb- lauren bacall -rrb- , and vivian 's younger sister carmen -lrb- martha vickers -rrb- . carmen is an example of an enduring cinematic character type that lives on to this day , the drop-dead gorgeous young woman who is absolutely out of control and does n't give a damn about anything but having a good time . this being 1946 , her personality is drawn mainly by suggestion , and suggestive lines , and vickers ' wickedly suggestive performance . it is said some of her scenes were cut to build up bacall 's part . if that 's true , it 's a shame . but then ` the big sleep ' is a pretty naughty film overall for its time . there 's bogart and bacall 's famous conversation with the ` racehorse ' analogy , which probably pushed the envelope as far as it would go back then . the film is heavy on dialogue , not so much on action , but you do n't really notice it . an air of threatening cold-bloodedness hangs over the proceedings , the feeling that life is cheap and anyone might be killed at any moment on someone else 's whim . in this way , it can be seen as a very early precursor to a film like ` blue velvet . ' when marlowe walks into a house to find carmen stoned and completely out of it , one gets the same feeling about the crowd she 's been hanging out with that you did in the david lynch film , where dennis hopper casually kidnaps and torments kyle mclachlan . bogart of course is perfect as marlowe ; at this stage in his career , he had the hardboiled private eye bit nailed . lauren bacall builds on her performance in ` to have and have not ' as the brainy and sexy femme fatale who sometimes is too clever for her own good . martha vickers is a knockout as the ` ' younger sister . her constant flirting with marlowe prompts his classic line , `` she tried to sit in my lap while i was standing up . '' the rest of the cast is standard issue , the usual warner bros. stock company of character actors , with one exception - a very young dorothy malone portrays a sexy bookworm with whom marlowe has a rainy day tryst . she makes the most of her scene . ` the big sleep ' is one of those films that you can watch again and again and always pick up something new from , an example of old-time hollywood at its most riskily and adventurous .		9		1
this is the real `` the shining '' movie . if you have the ability to watch lord of the rings extended editions , titanic , avatar , or anything over 165 minutes you can sit there and watch this one too . it 's approximately 4 and 1/2 hours long , but it 's worth it . steven weber plays jack torrence in perhaps his best performance of all-time . jack torrence here is golden compared to the bronze portrayal of nicholson 's 1980 edition . wendy is played by rebecca de mornay and danny is played courtland mead . stephen king is a true genius because he allows for his film of the shining to get under your skin just as much as his novel does . kubrick 's version omits and changes way too much for me to justify it as the shining . it 's basically just another horror film . if it was n't supposed to be an adaptation and just a story by kubrick , i 'd probably give it a 6 or 7 , instead of 2 . rebecca plays wendy as a strong and understanding woman with knockout looks to boot . danny is much stronger in this version and it takes almost two hours -lrb- or half the film -rrb- to get jack to start losing it . it takes nearly an hour for the torrence family to arrive at the hotel and actually be on their own . jack 's alcoholism is very key in the movie and the relationship between jack and danny is intense and strong . it really takes a lot out of you while watching the end , and i actually cried . i did n't cry when it came to kubrick 's version . that 's a big difference , because this film scared me but it also allowed me to get an emotional connection to all the characters and their bonds with each other . it 's an amazing adaptation of the shining novel , and rightfully so since stephen king is the teleplay writer . it 's the quintessential of horror in my eyes . i only have one problem with it , which is the fact that it 's barely ever available in dvd form and i 'm sure it 's not even available in blu-ray and most likely never will be .		9		1
i was very impressed with this film . i would have to rate it as one of the better classic-era westerns . i say that for the whole thing : the acting , mature dialog , no - nonsense story and excellent cinematography . director anthony mann , who did several well-photographed film noirs around this same era , also made some westerns such as this one . it has that same film-noir look . mann and jimmy stewart collaborated on several westerns during this period . . if you like this movie , i recommend the mann-stewart film `` bend of the river . '' in a nutshell , the story is about a man , `` lin mcadam , '' -lrb- stewart -rrb- who owns this prestigious winchester 73 rifle , a weapon he won in a contest . it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain . all of those villains are interesting characters . aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters , dan duryea , stephen mcnally , millard mitchell , charles drake , will greer and j. c. flippen . all of them are fun to watch . it was a bit of a stretch , however , to see rock hudson playing an indian -lrb- `` young bull '' -rrb- , but you ca n't have everything .		9		1
showcasing director justin lin 's signature accelerated precision , vin diesel 's dom races beside the speeding train as paul walker 's brian leaps into dom 's sports car . their car immediately careens over a steep chasm into the river below . diesel and walker leap in midair out of the car , and plunge into the water . `` fast five '' is just great fun . writer chris morgan 's story is better than the last `` fast and furious '' , which is n't saying much . then again we do n't see `` fast five '' for the narrative nuances . non-stop action reigns supreme . lin has a crisp vibrant visual style , and acumen for insane action . lin has two cars racing through the streets of rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction . granted this is over the top , and completely original . `` fast five '' has stunning rio de janeiro locals , gorgeous women , fast cars , and vin diesel squaring off against `` the rock '' dwayne johnson . lin has methodically checked off all the boxes . the theme of family distinguishes `` fast five '' from completely superfluous fare . in a quiet moment dom reminisces about his father . he remembers him working all day , and staying up late at night helping his sister mia with her homework . he recalls the generous neighborhood barbecues he had . conversely , brian has regrets about his father , `` he just was n't around . '' perhaps he has chance to alter his fate . amidst the flash , `` fast five '' earnestly adheres to family and loyalty . the band is back together in `` fast five '' , for one last heist . if i am not mistaken one of the band , han played by sung kang died in a previous lin directed sequel . stranger things have happened . the accelerated opening sequence recaps the rescue of dom toretto , where the last movie ended . federal agent brian o'connor and dom 's sister mia -lrb- jordana brewster -rrb- daringly execute the operation to free dom from serving an undeserved life sentence . in context what else could that be ? dom risked his life to help brian solve a heinous crime and bring killer to justice . lin throttles the adrenaline and velocity in this deadly game of chicken with a prison bus . this is only an omen of things to come . as `` fast five '' resumes , mia -lrb- brewster -rrb- and brian -lrb- walker -rrb- have been on the run in rio . they are seeking to rendezvous with dom -lrb- diesel -rrb- . dom has one last heist in mind : robbing the bank vault in the rio police station with $ 100 million of crime lord reyes -lrb- slick and villainous joaquim de -rrb- . apparently , reyes ' rule and influence knows no bounds in rio . so dom assembles his old team . dwayne johnson , massive hard muscle , shaved head and goatee , plays singular and intense federal agent hobbs , who is out to bring dom to justice . he instructs rio official to `` stay the f *** out of my way . '' hobbs and his team always get their man . as hobbs , johnson is imposing and handles guns and his fists with explosive results . of course we are waiting for vin to take on the rock in the final epic battle . chris morgan ingeniously stacks the story . dom is the thief with a code . hobbs is the cop with honor . reyes is the true villain . much like gravity , we can kind of figure how things will fall . predictability is some of the charm of `` fast five '' . vin diesel plays to his minimalist strength as dom . emotive is not his deal , but that is not required here . he commands the screen , and often surprises in his underplay . paul walker has become a pretty good actor . not much is demanded of him here . he deftly uses his charm and smarts . the rock is great as hobbs . he imposes as a formidable rival . here johnson 's straight arrow persona leverages the story 's ultimate conflict . `` fast five '' is not going to win any awards . it is just great fun . i look forward to the next sequel .		9		1
unfortunately , it seems as if two-time academy award winner hilary swank is one of the least famous actresses who managed to win the prestigious oscar trophy twice during the course of the years . i say so in great sorrow , as i believe swank is part of an elite list of modern-day actresses who truly lives up to the definition of acting . and boy can she act ! swank has that special ability to absorb herself into the role she 's playing . if she 's the androgynous victim in boys do n't cry , the nerdy cashier in the overlooked 11:14 or the powerful underdog boxer in this case -- she 'll always become the character and deliver a powerhouse , emotional draining , performance . anyway ... million dollar baby , clint eastwood 's little boxer film that could , became a surprise academy award best picture winner back in 2005 , beating scorsese 's wonderful the aviator . the plot itself , much like the film and its lead actress , tells the story of maggie fitzgerald , a female boxer -lrb- swank -rrb- who rises from her trailer-park life and become a professional fighter against the odds , with the help of her devoted manager , frankie dunn -lrb- eastwood -rrb- a washed-up trainer who has seen much better days . however , this is n't your average boxing film . unlike rocky , cinderella man and others of the genre , its final twist is truly unpredictable , and will most likely leave you pondering for days after watching the film . either way , i found it different in the right kind of fashion . it 's a film that does n't give in to the rules of the genre , and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead . since it did that and still managed to gross over 100 million dollars in the north american box office alone , i would call it a remarkable achievement for the human spirit .		9		1
`` this is england '' is one of the most poignant films about racism that i 've seen . set in early 80 's england , it is the story of a wayward , intelligent young boy who loses his father in the falkland war and drifts into the hands of a skinhead group led by a charismatic guy named woody . i would n't call it a gang really , because they are mostly peaceful ; goofing around , drinking beer , etc. . . they even have a jamaican member . they remain peaceful until militant combo gets out of prison and reclaims the kids from woody . combo is clearly someone who has been jaded by the inside of prison walls . he speaks of england 's woes and troubles with immigrants taking jobs away from natives . he speaks so well that several of the skinheads , including young shaun , abandon woody and join him in a much more serious gang . they attend meetings of the national front and combo becomes increasingly violent and enraged with the social situation he has landed in . he ends up taking out his rage on one of his skinhead friends and beating him down in a flurry of punches and kicks to the head . young shaun witnesses it and is forever changed . amazing acting , writing and direction highlight this film which i highly recommend to anyone who liked `` american history x '' or `` made in britain . '' 9 out of 10 , kids .		9		1
indiana jones and the last crusade starts with a great opening scene and never lets up afterwards . river phoenix is cast as the young indy and he does a terrific job . there 's a great chase on the top of a train and a neat little reminder of how indy received that scar on his chin . the opening , however , is just the start of a fantastic journey that involves nazi 's , a dogfight with fighter planes , and a well done journey into the lair of the holy grail . the screenplay , written by jeffrey boam , is terrific . it has the right amount of comedy one-liners and adventure to hold your attention for 2 hours . i have to comment on this character of indiana jones again . harrison ford plays this character so perfectly that he almost made me forget han solo and george lucas has created one of the most memorable characters in the modern cinema . steven spielberg seems very comfortable with the character and the stories . i 'm hoping for a new indiana jones picture soon .		9		1
i bought the dvd of this movie at the local rental place for just six dollars . i was tentative about the movie because the dvd had no special features whatsoever , and christian slater has made some bad movies over the last few years -lrb- e.g. `` alone in the dark '' -lrb- 2005 -rrb- , `` hard rain '' -lrb- 1998 -rrb- -rrb- . this film , however , is up there with slater 's best such as `` true romance '' and `` murder in the first '' . this film was made just as the decade of cheesy teen flicks had come to a close , which is why i originally thought this film would fall into that category . however , this film is remarkably good . it 's so good in fact that i have already seen it twice , and will soon see it again a third time . so what makes this movie so good ? for one , the insight of hard harry is often times hilarious , and the music he played on his pirate radio station literally foreshadows the ends of the hair metal days and the beginning of grunge . there are no hideous trends capitalized in this film , and no dated catch phrases . if this movie came out today , it would fit in pretty well aside from the fact that there are no computers in the film . besides that , though , the film is timeless . some people had some quarrels with the ending where you hear a collage of voices on other pirate radio stations . some people said it was too cheesy , especially the part where the girl said , `` can anyone hear me out there ? '' . i did n't think so , though . i thought the movie ended on an inconclusive but appropriate note , and without being too over the top . if there was one thing i would have liked to have seen added to this film , it would have been more in the beginning about christian slater 's character building the radio station . i would have liked to have seen how he did it , and also how he began building a huge following . but then again , that kind of beginning would have focused more on the rise and fall of the station than what slater had to say as hard harry . it would make for a pretty good prequel though , if anyone wanted to make one by now . overall , though , awesome film that is a vital component of my dvd collection . if you who are reading this review ever get a chance , pick up a copy at your video store . not too many rental stores have it to rent , but netflix probably does . check it out for yourself .		9		1
now this is truly a great imagination that tim burton had made in his whole life.this has every thing a martin should have , a spaceship , ray guns , lasers , etc. . . this truly showed many funny parts around the earth like in russia , took a picture when the blasted a a strike once they took out the wooden things , and mount rushmore of famous very funny of ' head on her dogs ' because of yodeling music the earth his the giant robot was really the giant claws nicholson play real good did two roles , president james dale and art too the joker he did just fine in this movie.i also like the funky music that was play for the martins ' theme real good from the ray guns that turn us into red or green skeleton was the this was a remake it wont be better like this even the director peter jackson or steven could make this movie even better than it was .		9		1
the fighter is one of the best sports movie i have ever seen . it ranks up there right next to rocky . the thing about this film is that it is just not about boxing because it would n't be half as good if it was . this film is essentially a love story and bonding between two brothers . that drama is what made me really like this movie . this film is based on true events as it tells the story of micky ward and dicky ecklund . dicky is a former boxer who is now a crack addict and micky is his half-brother who aspires to be a boxing world champion . will micky let his brother , his new girlfriend , and self-centered family get in his way of reaching that goal ? there were many strong performances in this movie . the most powerful ones were christian bale and melissa leo . i was shocked to see how much bale transformed for this movie . he plays dicky as if he was dicky in real life . leo is brilliant as the mother who cares deeply for her sons only if to make a profit for herself . wahlberg and adams delivered career-best performances as well . overall , the fighter is a worthy awards competitor . this ranks better than most sports films i have seen . i just loved the scenes when there were family issues . these scenes were powerful and they made me sympathize with the brothers how their lives been changed . i rate this film 9/10 .		9		1
away from her is an excellent and beautiful love and screenwriter sarah polley shows an enormous talent in this film , her first from her does not have cheap sentimentalism and i think that 's the best element from this great christie brings a magnificent performance and all the awards she received are totally pinsent also brings an extraordinary performance.the only i can say against this movie is that it had some slow moments.but , still with that , away from her is an excellent movie with extraordinary performances , without cheap sentimentalism and , the best thing of all , very entertaining except for some minimum is a very promising talent and it would be interesting to watch more movies directed by her .		9		1
deceptively up-to-date ` druggy ' drama is in fact deeply old-fashioned mixture of comedy and suspense . usual teen morality inverted in favour of amorality 's dizzy rush . death , hysteria , madness , dismemberment all flirted with , but comic spirit prevails . life for today 's young shown to be as joyless and repetitive as a melodrama , burdened with responsibilities - only escape is heightened reality . thinly characterised , hugely likeable characters , great dialogue , brilliant direction -lrb- especially the second segment -rrb- , wonderful film .		9		1
there has to be a reason why this movie musical was shown twice on our local tv . i even watched it twice , though the second time never really watched from start to end . given nicole kidman is one of my favourite celebrities , it 's one of those reasons i watched it . christian -lrb- ewan mcgregor -rrb- is a writer desperately searching ideas for his works till he was being thrust into writing a play , by accident . he went into moulin rouge and met some very interesting and colourful characters and people . satine -lrb- nicole kidman -rrb- is the most famous courtesan at moulin rouge and many are stunned by how she looked . though she is being engaged , she began a forbidden love story with christian . the song and dance are a big draw to this movie musical and both ewan and nicole can actually sing well . ` come what may ' is just so touching which almost made me cry . i know . watch it not because nicole kidman is in this movie musical -lrb- which i soon learned -rrb- . watch it because it is just so beautiful .		9		1
kiki is now thirteen , and it is now her right as a witch to leave home and move to another town to start her training as a witch for one year . her is her black cat jiji ; a very cynical , negative cat . moving to a seaside town set in france , kiki acquires a room in the attic of a bakery . she works in the bakery but she starts her own business ; a delivery service . a love interest ensues with tombo , a young boy who dreams of making his own flying machine . love also comes for jiji in the neighbours white cat . this is a beautiful story about coming of age , love , friendship and independence . kiki is such a naive girl when she leaves home ; but she is very head strong , also stubborn . but we all need to know that to ask for help is n't that hard , but pride is a very hard emotion to over come . the relationship between kiki and tombo is simple yet its so heart warming . entering the dating world is very hard , and though kiki wants to start a relationship with tombo , she 's to scared to take that step forward . but tombo is n't going to give up easily . the french setting is so beautiful . all the setting are wonderfully drawn ; as it is in all studio gibli movies . hayao miyazaki creates such a wonderful world inhabited by kiki . this i feel would more suit people in their late teens , as they are about the age of leaving home and starting to make their own decisions in life . its interesting that miyazaki has made the lead so young in this situation . though this may be seen as a kids movie , hayao miyazaki always creates a movie that anyone can enjoy and take something away from it . watching kiki 's service gives you such a warm feeling , you cant help but walk away with a smile on your face .		9		1
for death wish 3 , director michael winner knew he could n't just follow the same template he had on the first two films . it had worked for those , especially as the first was a bit rough , feeling a bit like trying to find one 's way in the darkness , and the second almost perfected the formula , even if that meant stumbling into a contradictorily attractive sewer . of course , death wish 3 still basically a revenge flick featuring charles bronson as paul kersey , an oddly charismatic architect turned vigilante taking out hordes of theatrical punks , but winner expands on the previous films here , bringing in allusions to other genres and films , and giving death wish 3 added thematic and emotional dimensions . one of the new dimensions may have been somewhat unintentional , but it 's one of my favorite modes , so it worked extremely well for me -- an absurdist humor that stems from the context of all three death wish films as a continual story . by this point in the series , kersey has such incredibly bad luck -- it seems that to be or become chummy with him in any way is virtually a death sentence -- that it is hilarious . this aspect is amplified by the fact that bronson deadpans his way through the film . so when he expresses hesitation for a romantic relationship because of past events , and both reassurance and disaster quickly follow , it 's as funny as tragic in context of the three films . winner also incorporates a lot of intentional humor and irony as the film progresses . winner does n't caricature his crime-ridden city as much as he did previously , but his gangs , or at least some gang members , still have a bit of broadway to them . however , it 's much easier to take the setting 's anarchic state seriously , especially since death wish 3 is set in brooklyn -lrb- the east new york section -rrb- during the tail end of its worst crime period . there is a bit of the feel and probably an influence from the warriors -lrb- 1979 -rrb- here . the major way that winner breaks his previous plot template is that this time most of kersey 's brooklyn neighbors join in the fray . the idea is a lot of fun . it not only gives us a couple handfuls of attractive , new characters to root for , but it gives death wish 3 the opportunity to mix its usual mood with elements from both war films and westerns . the mad max films -lrb- 1979 and 1981 -rrb- also seem to have been an influence , and aliens -lrb- 1986 -rrb- was to expand its plot in a similar way the following year . to make the war-like scope of death wish 3 believable , winner also makes the smart move of putting the head of police , richard s. shriker -lrb- ed lauter -rrb- , on kersey 's side , after a pleasantly gritty and surprising opening that first has them at loggerheads . winner was also smart to retain most of jimmy page 's score for death wish 2 . that it 's the same score is n't at all a minus , as page primarily composed a series of leitmotifs for characters and moods , so they serve to give death wish 3 a more solid continuity from the previous film . the additional music here , which was n't by page , is n't nearly as good , which is making me a bit anxious about death wish 4 , because page 's music was dropped there . for me , this is an odd series to this point because of the continual rise in the series ' quality . i still have never watched death wish 4 or 5 , so it will be interesting to see if the series can continue the trend . there is n't much further up to go .		9		1
lucas and spielberg 's first ode to the serial adventure is still a densely atmospheric , loaded thrill ride . indy is such a fascinating , larger-than-life personality that he outright demands our attention when he 's on the screen -lrb- which is something like 95 % of the time -rrb- and , even when we think we 've got him figured out , still manages to surprise us . casting harrison ford was absolutely crucial , though , because without his off-the-chart levels of confidence and charisma , the character would n't have been able to get away with half the things he does or says . although it trots the globe , seemingly without rest , the plot is actually very well-paced and wisely gives the cold shoulder to any hint of overwrought back-story or origin . we 're having enough fun in the present , so why get caught up in anything more complicated than `` he 's a professor who moonlights as a tomb raider '' ? quick-witted and funny when appropriate , exciting and unpredictable the rest of the time , it manages a near-perfect blend of realism and fantasy . the dark , dated cinematography is probably the only aspect of the film that has n't aged gracefully .		9		1
simply put this is the best harold and kumar movie ever ! you will never look at christmas the same way that rare exports will never have you look at santa the same way again -lrb- even more so than the bong smoking santa featured in the movie -rrb- . this basically is the stupidest movie of last year ... thank goodness -lrb- i 'm an atheist - me saying thank god is weird -rrb- this does n't try to be any more than what it is -lrb- eg , ted -rrb- . an example of the stupidity is when harold and kumar imagine they 're and are being chased by a giant killer snowman killing everything in it 's path with a jolly christmas song over the top ... so if that is n't your sort of humour then please , do not watch this movie . the basic plot is that it has been 8 years since guantanamo bay , harold and kumar have stopped being friends for 2 of those years . harold gets a package that was meant to be delivered to harold . as kumar gives harold the package he opens it only to find out that it 's a `` joint '' . harold throws it out only for it to go back in the house and burn down his father-in-law 's christmas tree . after that just sit back , relax and let the insanity -lrb- like ukranian gangsters , killer , giant killer snowmen and drug-addicted babies -rrb- do everything else for you . so please , do n't expect anything more than what it is -lrb- my rating is based on what it is - if i believed that this is better than stalker i 'd probably kill myself -rrb- just watch it with no intellectual thought at all and you 'll be fine .		9		1
the united states of leland is about a meek teenage boy named leland p. fitzgerald -lrb- ryan gosling -rrb- who has inexplicably committed a shocking murder . in the wake of the killing , his teacher in prison -lrb- don cheadle -rrb- tries to understand the senseless crime , while the families of the victim and the perpetrator struggle to cope with the aftermath . . i just watched the united states of leland for the second time and it is an outstanding piece of work and it 's close to being one of my favorite films of all time . why it was so poorly received by critics is beyond me because i think it 's a good example of great film-making in all accounts . the backdrop of the film is the crime that leland committed and from then on , the film becomes a character study giving us insight into leland and also showing the viewer what happened prior to the murder trough flashbacks . but , despite being a character study , the film does so much more then that ; it poses very interesting questions about good and evil , about life , about our nature and humanity and so forth . the film was beautifully shot and the soundtrack could n't be more suiting . these two things combined with an impeccable direction resulted in a great ambiance . the acting was absolutely fantastic with the exceptionally talented ryan gosling delivering an oscar-worthy performance . the entire supporting cast did a good job but if someone hold its own with gosling , that was jena malone . i was very , very impressed with her . this is not a happy film , it 's sad and melancholic and that will push some people away . maybe you have to have gone trough depression or extreme sadness to relate to the film , that would explain why some people just ca n't connect with this story , i do n't know . either way , i think this is a truly amazing film and i hope matthew ryan hoge returns to the business at some point . 9.5 / 10		9		1
the insider / -lrb- 1999 -rrb- **** -lrb- out of `` the insider '' prospers in almost every way , shape , and form possible . the production is a masterpiece of visual style , moving performances , and penetrating dialogue . the story is captivating , even at 157 minutes . there is more than enough unexpected plot twists to keep our attention at a consistent pace . many movies will have moments of inspiration and intrigue , but not `` the insider . '' this movie is one long intriguing moment , a moment that is never boring or lacking . it is also believable and entirely convincing . there is a realistic look into the behavior of journalists and their desire for information . it is so intelligent about revealing the most important information little at a time , always at the perfect second . russell crowe 's character is the heart of the film , one of the most active protagonists seen in a movie all year . he plays jeffrey wigand , an ex-employee at brown & williamson , one of the nations largest cigarette manufacturers . its chairman -lrb- michael gambon -rrb- has fired wigand for questioning some of their potentially harmful research tactics and business not before blackmailing him into signing a strict confidentiality agreement that threatens his much needed severance package currently providing for his wife and their two young girls . when the company even further jeopardizes his existence , he blows his fuse and prepares to release information on the indecisive industry of b & w . he gets his opportunity when lowell bergman -lrb- al pacino -rrb- , an ambitious and experienced reporter from the cbs news program `` 60 minutes , '' receives a package regarding product safety studies at another tobacco company . bergman contacts wigand , aspiring towards hiring him as a transitory consultant for a potential `` 60 minutes '' show . bergman senses some vital information withheld in the knowledge of wigand , therefore further investigates what he is making the executives at b & w so concerned . the film makes many unexpected turns ; in the second half , it smartly switches focus from wigand to bergman . after losing his privacy , secrets , reputation , and family , wigand revealing startling facts and starts a new career teaching chemistry . but bergman faces further complications . his tv network refuses to air the segment because they could be sued big time for helping break wigand 's confidentiality agreement . `` you pay me to go get guys like wigand , to draw him out . to get him to trust us , to get him to go on television . i do . i deliver him . he sits . he talks . he violates his own f ***** g confidentiality agreement . and he 's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue , maybe the biggest , case in u.s. history . and jeffrey wigand , who 's out on a limb , does he go on television and tell the truth ? yes . is it newsworthy ? yes . are we gon na air it ? of course not . why ? because he 's not telling the truth ? no . because he is telling the truth . that 's why we 're not going to air it . and the more truth he tells , the worse it gets , '' explains bergman . the dialogue is one of the brightest , most thought-provoking material in the film . all of the little quirks in typical conversation are captured , the stuttering , the spontaneous explicit , and the sharp remarks that add a scathing zest to the character 's personalities -lrb- agent : do you have a history of emotional problems , mr. wigand ? wigand : yes . yes , i do . i get extremely emotional when ******* s put bullets in my mailbox ! -rrb- . the movie 's dramatic premise is so clear , so precise , so uncommonly absorbing . it expresses the true stress and nature of the traumatic emotions of the characters . there is also an excellent introduction of both wigand and bergman , giving them depth and human dimension . despite a few members of my cinema discussion group disagree , i extensively enjoyed the piercing middle-eastern soundtrack consisting of awkward beats and fitting tones . al pacino is cautious not to steal scenes from co-star russell crowe , but when his time comes he lets out a stark and involving performance . crowe is worthy of his oscar nomination for best actor ; he delivers a performance of great , but with an intense underlying tone of innovative depth and power . he captures all of the little tensions and stresses of his character , making his scenes involving , subversive , and taut . michael mann is the film 's director , who also directed the 1995 thriller `` heat '' starring val kilmer , robert de niro , and al pacino . here , he pays close attention to details ; when a character pushes numbers on a pay phone , the camera captures the hitting golf ball against a backdrop , dropping glasses on a table , and notably in an intense scene where two people fax each other important statements and questions . mann also injects effective camera angles complete with slow motion photography , taking the view of the character , and close up shots . `` the insider '' inhabits a strong social message dealing with the influence of television , reputation , honesty , and so forth . the biggest ethic i think mann is trying to get across is of modern morality : always do the right thing , follow you conscience , no matter what the cost . then there 's the film 's most provoking issue : `` fame has a fifteen-minute half-life . infamy lasts a little longer .

the movie starts out pretty uncomfortably , two peasants in 16th century japan who dream of richness and glory so blindly , they ca n't even hear the pretty straight-forward protests of their loving wives who try to convince them that their happiness is fine at home . when one , a pottery smith , makes a small bundle selling his wares , they decide to make a much larger batch together and become rich . forced out of their homes by an approaching war and uncertain where to go , they take their wares to a thriving market place , where the second peasant 's ambition to be a samurai divides them and causes all four characters , the two peasants and their wives , to be separated , all fending for themselves amongst the war and various classes differently . at this point the film reverses itself and instead of being a pretty skin-deep , tragic bud of greed , it blooms into a beautiful and haunting tale of obsession and illusion . the two main stories of the peasants and their wives are opposite only in their imaged realism , where one peasant falls completely under the curse of an enchanting ghost and the other lies and steals his way to fame , only both of them are eventually knocked down from their own hubris and forced to finally awaken to what their wives have said all along . it 's quite exquisite , this movie , with its long takes and its lack of the usual constructs that make up messages of obsession and greed . once it gets beyond the small , uncomfortable , claustrophobic world of the peasant 's home , it becomes audaciously challenging and mysterious , so that the same small home becomes amazingly wonderful and comforting . the very essence of the movie is breathed into the emotions of the audience in very subtle ways , making a very unforgettable cinematic experience . -- polarisdib		9		1
` unbreakable ' is an m. night shyamalan -lrb- 37 -rrb- film , the born in india , raised in philadelphia who , back in 1999 , scored a world hit totally out of the blue with the marvelous lo film ` the sixth sense ' . and i 'm pretty sure about it now , the m stands for magnificent . there are a lot of red threads running through his films ; they 're all spellbound fairy tales , always beautifully visualized and injected with a message and the most prominent feature : a trademark plot twist that 'll drop your jaw like a drafty shed door during a heavy thunderstorm . his films are so very intelligently written ; they never are what they appear to be at first sight . ` the village ' has the look of a mystery/horror but peel away that first layer and what you get is actually a quite beautiful love story . less skilled directors would 've surely taken unbreakable 's premise and cheapened it to action-movie banality but shymalan carefully shapes it into an impressive . contrary to popular opinion , his work does not rely solely on spectacular plot twists . in fact most of his movies are just as good without the end twist . but it is the cherry on top . shyamalan reminds me of fincher in that perspective even though fincher 's movies are still a class higher obviously . ` unbreakable ' is definitely the one in shyamalan 's oeuvre that shares the most elements with ` the sixth sense ' : the same lead actor -lrb- bruce willis -rrb- , the same atmosphere , again a supernatural story , and again a late surprising plot twist . some folks will , for that reason , undoubtedly claim that shyamalan just repeated his success hit , but that statement is about as absurd as ` pulp fiction ' allegedly being a watered down version of ` reservoir dogs ' . ` unbreakable ' is on the contrary a mighty confirmation of shyamalan 's exceptional skill . to reveal much of the story is forbidden . an again very timidly acting willis portrays david dunn , a somewhat troubled security guard who solely - and without a scratch or bruise - survives a horrible train wreck . the commencement is not unlike ` fearless ' -lrb- where jeff bridges walks away unharmed from a plane crash -rrb- , but from the moment samuel l. jackson 's character is introduced - as the mysterious man who has a very peculiar explanation for david 's alleged unbreakable ability - ` unbreakable ' sails in a totally different , more supernatural , direction . the plot itself barely rises above the better-than-average comic book actually , but visually ` unbreakable ' has a lot in common with the looks of an european art-film : just like in ` the sixth sense ' shyamalan refrains from showy action , stunts or effects - we 're even denied the train crash - but he spellbinds the audience with unusually long , uncut scenes , a dark color pallet , and a unconventionally slow pace , - all very means that provide ` unbreakable ' with the allure of a drama . if ingmar bergman would have directed ` x-men ' , than this is about the result we 'd get -lrb- the dispiriting confrontations between david and his other half would n't be misplaced in bergmans ' ` scenes from a marriage ' nota bene -rrb- . and even though shyamalan 's scenario is glitched this time around -lrb- it 's rather unbelievable that david ca n't remember whether he 's ever fallen ill -rrb- -rrb- , i still ca n't be anything else than deeply impressed by his mastership : when david hangs up his guard jacket -lrb- brilliant scene ! -rrb- you realize in a flash that the cineaste has always stayed one step ahead of you , that every detail checks out and all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place majestically . unbreakable class !		9		1
`` o brother , where art thou ? '' , a retelling of the odyssey but in 1930s mississippi , has its champions and detractors . i 'm a champion , but understand what the detractors are saying . one criticism is that the movie does n't hold together , that it 's too disjointed . i agree it does n't have a strong narrative flow , but that 's not much of a drawback . the movie is morality play , it 's written in crayon , not with a word processor . criticism two is that it 's not on par with the coens other work like `` blood simple '' and `` fargo '' . so what ? it 's not supposed to be . and the soundtrack ? it 's one of the best in years , and worth the price of a rental by itself . i found obwat a very entertaining movie and definitely worth a rental .		9		1
`` caged '' is the rare kind of movie that works both as a film to take seriously and as a camp classic . eleanor parker plays marie allen , a naive 19-year-old who goes to prison as an accomplice in an armed robbery staged by her loser husband . she does n't really belong there , but despite the efforts of the prison administrator -lrb- agnes moorehead -rrb- to help her get paroled , she remains locked up , only to be turned into a jaded criminal by the very institution that 's supposed to reform her . the film is full of rough stuff , atrocities and indignities heaped one after another on marie or the other inmates . women are beaten , subjected to psychological abuse , thrown into solitary confinement . their heads are shaved , they have babies who they 're forced to give up for adoption . one woman freaks out and breaks a window with her bare hands , and we see the blood spurting from her severed arteries . another woman hangs herself . presiding over all is sadistic warden evelyn harper , played memorably by the gigantic actress hope emerson , who abuses her power so egregiously that she eventually gets stabbed in the chest with a fork by one crazy inmate while parker 's character hisses `` kill her ! kill her ! '' the screenplay tosses out one memorable line after another -- my favorite is parker 's departing words to moorehead when marie finally gets her parole : `` thanks for the haircut . '' but for all the sensationalism , the film is no joke . it 's well directed by john cromwell , who clearly wanted to make a serious indictment of a flawed system , and if it 's lurid , it 's also effective . i laughed a lot , but i also found myself outraged . in addition to parker , emerson -lrb- both oscar nominated , by the way -rrb- and moorehead , the cast also includes jan sterling and betty garde as two of the more memorable inmates . grade : a		9		1
before i saw this film , i had been waiting on `` waiting ... '' -lrb- lol -rrb- to come out because of one name that stood out to me : dane cook . i 'm a huge dane cook fan , and was simply ecstatic to see him in a film . but do n't worry , because this movie is more than dane cook . you 'll be surprised to see everyone 's favorite funny man ryan reynolds , `` scary movie '' star anna faris , `` dodgeball '' star justin long , dane cook , the hilarious luis guzman , and everyone 's favorite idiot , andy milonakis . director rob mckittrick 's first movie is a winner , and here 's why . the plot centers around the lives of the employees of shenanigans restaurant -lrb- which , by the way , is not real -rrb- . monty -lrb- ryan reynolds -rrb- is the hunky man in his 20 's who has a thing for high school girls , like the hostess natasha -lrb- vanessa lengies -rrb- . naomi -lrb- ubach -rrb- is the always angry waitress that needs to get out more , calvin -lrb- robert patrick benedict -rrb- is the nice man waiter who has a `` problem . '' dean -lrb- justin long -rrb- is the community college student who once was an honors high school student , and amy -lrb- kaitlin doubleday -rrb- is dean 's ... well you could say she 's his girlfriend . serena -lrb- anna faris -rrb- is another waitress , and monty 's beautiful ex-girlfriend , and the group is headed by dan -lrb- david koechner -rrb- , the restaurant 's delusional manager . the kitchen staff is the of the film , with floyd -lrb- dane cook -rrb- the hilarious and energetic cook , bishop -lrb- chi mcbride -rrb- the , and raddimus -lrb- luis guzman -rrb- the always horny cook . there are also two teen slackers , nick and t-dog -lrb- andy milonakis and max kasch -rrb- who are the busboys of the restaurant and the resident wannabe gangsters . oh yeah , and they 're white . they are simply hilarious . the film starts out in dean 's house , where a huge party is happening for all of shenanigans ' employees . we meet all the characters the next day at work . dan enters with a lost looking young man named mitch -lrb- john francis daley -rrb- , and we meet monty again , who will train mitch in the `` ways '' of shenanigans , which include a game amongst the men that involves their `` gifts '' -lrb- go see the film to see the prank , it 's hilarious -rrb- . the funny thing about mitch is that no one ever lets him finish a sentence , which mounts to by far the funniest part at the end of the movie . we continue to meet the characters and learn about them and their hilarious persona . we see everything that goes with restaurants , from rival businesses , pranks , bantering fellow employees , and of course , food tampering , which of course is led by floyd . the movie does have its perverted and mildly disgusting moments , but they are made in such a way that it 's very funny . all the actors play their roles perfectly , especially ryan reynolds , luis guzman , and dane cook . if you want to see more of these actors , reynolds and anna faris both star in another movie due this year , called `` just friends , '' while dane cook stars with chris evans and jessica biel in a movie called `` london , '' due in 2006 . ryan reynolds is also in `` the amityville horror '' and `` national lampoon 's van wilder . '' you can catch justin long in `` dodgeball : a true underdog story , '' starring ben stiller and vince vaughn , and `` herbie : fully loaded , '' alongside lindsay lohan . with countless memorable lines and events , and lovable characters , teamed with a great plot and original humor , `` waiting ... '' is an instant cult classic for the ages . you want the humor to end because you 're laughing so hard , but really , you do n't . have fun , and be sure to say thanks to rob mckittrick , who is here on imdb . 9/10		9		1
just another in uwe boll 's endless cookie cutter game series . it 's the same old stuff : sexy babes in leather type war uniforms -lrb- cheap xena wannabe 's -rrb- , swords , blood , gore , phony medieval accents , impossibly large castles , lousy cgi , and more . the story is this : there is no story . you have a half-breed vampire -lrb- what ?? -rrb- named `` rayne '' who wants to get even with the creepy kagen -lrb- ben kingsley slumming it -rrb- because he croaks lots of people -lrb- and he wants to croak her too -rrb- -- or something like that . she reluctantly joins a bunch of barbarians , with the michelle rodriguez trying to look -- what . more blood . more gore . more phony accents . more non-story action . more insane cgi . uwe boll tried to top his epic `` house of the dead , '' and comes mighty close . if you like endless , mindless , purposeless sword fight scenes with occasional stoic dialog interludes , see this movie . if you 're a fan of so-bad-it 's - funny trash movies , maybe you 'll find humor in it . all others : be forewarned .		2		0
who would have thought that one of the summer 's most anticipated films would become the political lightening rod the liberal activists have made it today ? how did this happen ? whether 20th century fox or the filmmakers wanted it or not , radical activist groups such as the have openly embraced the film , even going so far as to hold a rally not far from the premiere of the film . among the speakers that were expected to attend was environmental nut-job himself , al gore , who spoke in new york city about the subject of global-warming on the coldest day in over half-a-century . that alone should demonstrate the credibility of these people but they embraced the film none the less , all to no avail to be sure . with less then one-third of the country concerning themselves with the environment , few will find this film to be more then flashy special-effects and unrelenting , if not mindless , destruction . the story centers on the aftermath of global warming as one ` rogue ' scientist battles both man-made and natural blockades in order to save his son who is trapped in a now new york city . professor adrian hall is one of the leading scientists in his field trying to raise awareness over the growing environmental problem the planet will eventually face in the not too distant future but few will listen . that is until numerous natural disasters begin to engulf the planet . tornadoes rip through california , snowstorms pound eastern asia , and gigantic tidal waves slam into new york city , where his son is attending an competition . while the rest of the united states heads further south in order to avoid continuing cataclysmic disasters , adrian hall is the only one marching north all in an effort to rescue his son and save any hope left for humanity . the story for the day after tomorrow is so ridiculously absurd and laughably clichéd that you may actually question the mentality of the radical liberals using this film as a launching pad to resurrect a dying , if not already dead , environmental proposal . to start things off , the film 's entire concept , outside of the myth of global-warming being taken for serious fact , is decisively unrealistic . granted that was the same situation with another emmerich , independence day , but at least that film had a credible script and a group of characters that the audience cared about ; something the day after seriously lacks . the problem lies in the fact that the film becomes tremendously bogged down by so many intertwining characters and their separate story lines that it becomes increasingly difficult for any audience to singularly attach themselves to a particular character within the film which , as a result , makes any actions on screen . the supposed hero of the film is professor adrian hall , played to the best of his abilities by dennis quaid . as great of a actor as quaid can be , it does n't fit well with this particular character that is suppose to be a rogue but is n't , in that hall has to report to someone before any situation even if it concerns the life of his son . while on that subject , why does hall go to new york after stating just minutes earlier that the best they could do for the people stranded in the area was pray ? and supposing he did make it to new york then what did he plan on doing ? all communications were out so how was he going to get them out of there ? and is it asking too much to question hall 's skills as a scientist ? all these freakish weather anomalies are occurring that apply to your theory and yet you let your son go to new york . does that make sense ? and why is it that he is able to have this shocking theory that many slowly begin to accept but only begins collecting data to back it up once the effects of global warming are in full swing ? samuel hall , played by environmental wacko jake gyllenhaal , is a prime example of the typical emotionally depressed teenager always fervent in clichéd films . he mopes because his father is n't around all the time ... boo-hoo ! at least he has a father , it 's not like his father is dead or his parents are divorced and he 's never around . and the story about the ` f ' he received for not showing work on his mathematics test and talking back to the teacher ... what bull-crap ! show your damn work even if you can do it in your head -lrb- to be sure , his teacher is n't the only one in mathematics within the country who enforces such a policy -rrb- and do n't talk back . it 's that simple ! and if sam is as upset with his father as he appears to be , why does he choose to believe his father 's promise to get him in new york if he has failed him so many times in the past ? scenario or not , it does n't make sense . overall , roland emmerich and his band of cronies dispatch with all concepts of space and time , not to mention any at all scientific merit , in order to achieve their goal of promoting an out environmental agenda so clichéd that by the end of the film 's nearly two hour run you 'll be saddened to contemplate the thought of this being the last stand of the environmental wackos of the world . if these people so vividly believe the ideas that they promote , why would they ever soil their core beliefs by having them mixed together with over-the-top special effects and bad science that , in the end , contradicts any serious scientific merit they are trying to achieve ? time serves no purpose within the film , although humanity seems to be always short of it whenever the script calls for it to be . in what should take it thousands , if not millions , of years , the cataclysmic effects of global warming unfold before our eyes in a time frame of less then two weeks , though that is a rough estimate as no accurate time line of events is given . granted things need to fit within a two hour film but even for the sake of global warming even that is a little ridiculous . on top of that , the liberal propaganda machine rolls out a weak excuse to lift current immigration policies via a turning of the tables scenario late within the film . in the future has mexico gone loco when they are dealing with a global catastrophe and they are more concerned about getting even on immigration policies then saving lives ? as was said earlier , the day after suffers severely from predictable and overly clichéd situations that become more abundantly clear as the movie progresses . so much so that one wonders why not a single studio executive raised the before letting this get off the . without rambling out an entire list , which would be tediously long , let 's say the best , if not the most unnoticed , example lied in the scene in which sam hall watches another guy come in and flirt with laura , the girl he likes , while ` you do n't want to hurt me ... you do n't want to make me cry ' plays softly in the background of the cafeteria . and lastly , it is absolutely disturbing to contemplate the filmmakers ever wanting to showcase the destruction of new york city after the destructive event that took place on september 11th , 2001 , and yet it is prominent here . have n't new yorkers , let alone americans in general , been through enough that they should witness this on screen ? how many damn times does emmerich have to destroy nyc before he gets his final kicks ? perhaps one day the fbi would like a conversation with mr. emmerich and his disaster team . on a more serious note , no amount of eye-popping special-effects can save this film from being anything more then environmental propaganda to warn of an event they themselves can not substantially prove . my rating : * out of 5 -lrb- grade : f + -rrb-		2		0
my recollections of this movie were n't favorable . the movie was really good until caine , a journalist , investigating so called abductions on the high seas , and his annoying gun nut son , end up on this island , after such a smooth landing -lrb- note there -rrb- by a nonchalant old buzzard of a pilot , who caine goes off at . a worthy moment . after that it really sucks , where his theory becomes shockingly true , where this band of modern day pirates , hijack and rob unsuspecting boat folk , and keep them hostage , where they eventually submit , to the inescapable . here they corrupt the mind of caine 's son , turning him against him . and too we have angela punch mcgregor in this , for god 's sake . for an aussie actress , out of all the american films , would you really want to be remembered for starring in a crappy vehicle like this . again , this film is an adaption of a peter benchley novel , who like jaws and the deep , has a fondness for the ocean . this film adaption was obviously like a one off for him , where his novel would surely be better . the son was fun like in the gun shop , and he 's not a bad aim . on the island , this film becomes a dull bore , with some weird sex , it 's only interesting attraction . it 's a shame in one side , where from the start , the film showed promise , but on the island , it 's just became utterly pointless , fruitless viewing if you will . i can just say , i 'm glad i did n't see this at the cinema , but there is worse floating about , but not much . what a stinker .		2		0
if this truly is art , we 're . that 's right . we 're truly . it shows that we live in a predictable society . a society where something `` different '' is by defaults great , or `` art '' . i really do beg to differ . first off this film is 160 minutes . that 's right . 160 fracking minutes . and part of the film is the same scene repeated at least 5 times . trust me , you could cut this down to 100 minutes and nothing would be lost -lrb- as if there was anything to begin with -rrb- , and that 's a sign that it 's a very bad film . what very little plot there is relies on the film 's annoying style . actually there is no plot . the idea of a first person film may sound good on paper - and i 'll admit in the first 30 minutes it works well . 30 minutes it works well ? well maybe if the whole movie was like that , it 'd be great ! but then we have 90 minutes where nathaniel brown 's fat head takes up the frame . the rest is just crane shots that have little to no relevance . i swear i could draw a map of japan , there 's so many overhead shots . do n't even think of getting me started on the lights coming out of people 's genitals , or the cgi `` vagina cam '' shot and weird sex . and the sex scene at the end and birthing scene ? trust me , this film only exist to attract smug elitist scum . too bad they do n't realize this film is too long , an exercise in style over substance , has bad acting and zero subtlety . i said it once and will say it again - we live in a predictable society .		2		0
i thought this movie was horrible . it was n't funny ; it was boring . the lead character just was n't interesting . and if you are going to use such a ridiculous plot ; then it needs to be funny , and this was n't . maggie q was the only interesting person in this ; and mainly because i remember her from the last die hard movie . she even uses some of the same moves . i just did n't find ping pong appealing . fighting to the death over ping pong ; just did n't get it . christopher walken was n't even too interesting in this . final verdict : one of the worst films of the year .		2		0
with brittany murphy as the lead , you expect this to be a comedy . plus , i remember seeing the commercials on tv , and it was promoted like it 's funny . well , it 's a heavy drama . ray , played by fanning , has a dad she refers to as a `` vegetable '' because he had a stroke , and her mom pays no attention to her . molly , played by murphey , lost her parents at a young age and finds out she was swindled out of her money . plus , she is very unlucky in love and needy at the same time . so , she is forced to get a job and ends up as ray 's nanny . so , the two who are lost for different reasons teach each other about life and become friends . also molly longs after this guy , neal , who just uses her for song ideas . then she catches him hooking up with ray 's mom who is in the music industry . and at the end , after being a changed person , molly still wants neal because he bought all her dad 's old guitars . that made no sense because neal had already lost his chance with her , but to show how weak she is , she takes him back . final verdict : too depressing , too dramatic . this film stars brittany murphy , not meryl streep . it should have been lighter . people are n't going to watch this to be taught a lesson .		2		0
i really despair when i see that people love this sort of stuff . 10,000 people having given this an average rating of 7 ???? words escape me ... anybody who has rated this sack of uncool idiocy above 3 should go home and rethink their lives . it 's the lowest common denominator stuff , filled with nothing but foul language and diarrhea jokes , fer cripes sake ! it 's just dumb , dumb , dumb ! they probably use the f-word in every single sentence , and that 's supposed to be funny ?! will somebody please explain that to me ? because i am absolutely clueless . 2 out of 10 .		2		0
this movie is a sure cure for insomnia , except for the most extreme cases . sinatra and dino play two guys that do n't make a bit of sense , but we 're supposed to think they do . in other words , they play the characters they always play in movies together . what they are talking about is not just outdated . it never existed . i was born in 1956 , and nothing they do or say makes any sense to me . the movie makes no sense either . it is just a bunch of words strung together , apparently written by people on drugs . it 's some sort of melodrama , but do n't try to stay awake through it . it 'll just make you hate the idiots in the movie even more . some came running to watch the movie . all left sleeping .		2		0
no filmmaker can make me feel like an idiot like robert rodriguez . this , you do n't know how it shames me to say , is the third time i 've left a rodriguez film baffled that i went of my own accord in the first place . i pride myself on my taste in cinema . you do n't have to agree with me , but the fact is that friends are constantly asking me what good movies i 've seen lately , whether or not they should see certain movies , because they value my opinion of movies a great deal . movies are what i do with my life . i 'm constantly seeking better , more awe-inspiring and artistic films each time i see one . and i willingly pay money to see machete , a movie which i positively should 've known would be a tedious , mindless waste of its somewhat appealing concept ? why did i do that ? again ? i do n't like rodriguez 's movies . i think they 're all ultimately very shallow , silly , indiscriminate , jumbled , to say the least . in doubtful times , the media 's surveillance function often labels groups seen as potential threats . we did it to japanese citizens in wwii , arabs and muslims after 9/11 . we think gays getting married will devalue our own marriages . we equate black neighborhoods with dangerous ones . hispanics get a similar bad rep in america because we feel the more of them immigrate , the less jobs , cars , etc. for us . i was drawn to machete , in part , because of its attempt to do what more american films should , correlating different social aspects in response to the true threats affecting the culture 's value position . alas , after letting us know , via funky tell-tale scoring , phony celluloid scratches , that this will be yet another simulated '70s exploitation picture , rodriguez strives for the lowest common denominator purely because it 's fun and because he 's unilaterally interested in the thrill of the technical process as opposed to the creative or aesthetic value of that result . i think i was anxious to see this pinnacle of rodriguez nonsense because judging by its trailer , cast , topicality , i figured it would be self-ironic . but instead it 's . rodriguez is famous for always working on to inspire more creativity . name one sign of that here , one remote use of creativity . i 'll give you $ 100 . `` i do n't go to these kinds of movies for any intellectual or philosophical content . i go to see stuff blow up and bad guys get theirs . '' same here ! i still hated it ! `` it 's an ode to the old grindhouse pictures . '' ok , fine . you know , creativity means having to use your head a little to embrace what 's happening on screen . i apologize for thinking that something interesting should happen , that any suspense should be built or actual relationships should form . but no , people get killed , so you 're happy because you did n't have to `` think . '' good for you ! millions of dollars were spent to construct ... nothing ! maybe an allusion to how right-wing politics poison living conditions and equality . yet ironically , i see how rodriguez reinforcing grotesque , exploitative stereotypes of his own ethnicity means little to nothing to him at all , because they 're shooting , stabbing , setting afire people who are against them , so it 's ok that essentially every single hispanic person here is directly involved in heartlessly slaying countless people whenever , wherever , however , and that 's the end of it . no other consequences . women are only bimbos here . tough , hard-hitting bimbos who can fight . but bimbos nevertheless . they 're not allowed to be actual characters . are there movies i like that are basically male shoot-em-ups wherein women are only there to be idealized from the perspective of a masculinity complex ? hell yes . every bond film . but if you 're here for the same reasons quoted above , you wo n't see jessica alba and michelle rodriguez as anything but their skin-tight , clothing suggests . but what am i saying ? just because many brainless male-driven actioners like this portray women this way does n't mean that this one 's the same : every single character in this movie , man or woman , performed with a touch of charm or not , is nothing but an oversimplification designed to either kill or be killed , mostly the latter , the least interesting of whom the former , and nobody in between . is it too harsh to say that seeing this movie charred a black , irreconcilable gulch across my mind , as it 's upset the murky trenches of my psyche ? maybe , because that 's savage criticism to an almost substandard degree . but what i 'm dead serious about is this film being -- above all , more importantly than my own personal distaste for this no-brainer kind of movie and the mindless self-indulgence of the jerk-off muscle-flexing wet dream that it is -- principally , a on the velvet sheet of robert de niro 's filmography . in a lot of filmwork wherein he lacks creative control , the other performances really are n't his concern . if the other actor is n't giving him what he needs , he acts as though he were , which does n't work for very long in this case . i do n't have to tell anybody this man 's credentials , how he 's changed the face of acting for the camera forever . and nevertheless , he 's here , playing the most interesting character in the movie , relegated to the most violated . he as the villain , as well as the most talented and distinguished star of the entire star-studded cast of mostly b-movie schlock hams , is the least well-handled of rodriguez 's in the entire cast . that 's a hard competition . if i were president of hollywood , i 'd sanction rodriguez 's gladly , without remorse . the fact that his output is slowing down anyway is a plus . but the fact that i 'm not and never will be president of hollywood can only be compensated by my vow to never see anything by this boorish , puerile , immature hack ever again in my life . done talking about him too . bye .		2		0
the addams lawyer knows that the missing festor addams is the eldest and the house and all it 's fortunes belong to him , so he gets a fake festor to come in and pretend . mother claims to be a doctor who found the missing boy in the bermuda triangle . the addams buy it and are ultimately kicked out of their house as festor and his mother and the crooked lawyer try to find the hidden money . soon the truth is discovered and the scheme is over and you find that the impostor really is festor after all . i used to love this tv show and also the cartoon , and this movie does n't in anyway do it justice . characters are changed and it just does n't have the same appeal as the show . the fact it changed and not exactly like the show had almost no reasoning in my decision to rate it so low , i just simply did n't find it funny or amusing . the actors here all did excellent jobs portraying their version of the original cast . this movie just lacked any kind of heart . it was over the top childish at times too . this is another good example of bad choice in music because its huge at the time . mc hammer was big in 91 and now he is a laughing stock . the over all score of the movie left so much to be desired too . barry directed this and it was his first movie . tim burton was set to direct but did n't for some reason and barry tried so hard too direct like tim , in fact for many years barry continued to try and direct in the style of burton . actors here were just great for the most part . angelica houston as morticia and she did a great job , cher wanted the role and i am curious as to how she would have played it . raul julia tried to fill john shoes and did a bad job , raul is the worst actor on this film . christina ricci in an early role was perhaps the best star of this film , she truly made wednesday her very own and just rocked it . christopher llyod is magnificent and donned a fat suit here for festor . dan hedaya , elizabeth wilson and dana ivey did great jobs too . i do n't think this film as as good as the show , it lacked heart , it had flaws -lrb- like public acceptance of thing , for one -rrb- . the score was bad the direction was not up to par and it was lazy ... i did like many actors and it gave me a couple laughs 2/10 stars		2		0
` the hills have eyes part ii ' is n't the lowers of the low you can go with a sequel of a good film , but it probably is pretty close . in some ways it felt almost as a parody of the original and that surprised me , as it is made by the same man who made the first one : wes craven . from some freak co-incidence one of the feral cannibals has survived from the first movie , even thought we saw em ' all get killed , and this time he 's accompanied by his uncle , which was something of surprise , as he was n't mentioned in the first film and the daddy of original head of the cannibal family mentioned only having two children , a daughter who died and the bloodthirsty psychopath son . but then again maybe he was lying . but okay , this time the group of would be victims are a group of motorcyclist in a way to a competition to seal their fate -lrb- literally this time -rrb- . they are accompanied by ruby -lrb- janus blythe -rrb- who actually is the daughter of the feral family , now civilized with the help of the survivors of the carter family . this story short , the buss has an accident and they are forced to stay near the silver mine occupied no other than pluto and ol' uncle reaper . the whole film is just idiotic . not that the first one was any brain food , but this is one is just one huge cashing in attempt . there 's lots and lots of flashbacks from the original film , showing off how the carter 's snuffed the cannibals . that would have been appropriate for a quick montage , but now i felt , that the scenes were put in just to make the movie a bit longer . they also substituted for the lack of bigger cannibal family . as it often is the actions of the people stranded among psychotic people were far from the normal behavior of people in that kind of situation . people went out to cuddle even though they knew , that their friends were missing . the acting was pretty horrible , and this time there was n't even good atmosphere to back it up . all in all thhe : felt very forced effort and maybe that 's something the movie really was . craven did it directly after ` the nightmare on elm street ' , which is a movie , that provided one of the most known horror characters of cinematic history . maybe craven felt upping the ante with one of his older creations . all i can say he 's failed . horribly . rating : 2 of 10 camp rating : 5 of 10		2		0
many fans of the successful video game were expecting this live action film to be a good action film , even with good casting , special effects and direction by simon west -lrb- con air -rrb- this did n't happen . basically lara croft -lrb- the gorgeous razzie nominated angelina jolie -rrb- finds a clock in a hidden room of her mansion , placed there by her father lord richard croft -lrb- jon voight , jolie 's real father -rrb- . it contains the key to finding two halves of an ancient triangle which when activated can control time for good or evil . it is lara 's job to find and destroy the two halves of the triangle before manfred powell -lrb- iain glen -rrb- , along with supposed traitor alex west -lrb- daniel craig -rrb- , get to it first . also starring noah taylor as bryce , christopher ` chris ' barrie as hillary , green wing 's julian rhind-tutt as mr. pimms and leslie phillips as wilson . jolie seems to be the perfect actress , putting on an elizabeth hurley -lrb- a rumoured contender for the role -rrb- english accent , but even she ca n't make this film worth watching . the supporting cast , including craig putting on a weird american accent , do n't help much either , the special effects are wasted , and the story is pretty tame , so all in all , a disappointment . angelina jolie was number 74 on the 100 greatest movie stars , lara croft was number 69 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons , and she was number 6 , and jolie number 1 on the 100 greatest sex symbols -lrb- it could have been marilyn monroe -rrb- . pretty poor !		2		0
`` the usual suspects '' needs no more praise , and `` the x-men '' was one of the most intelligent summer blockbusters in years . so it 's all the more surprising how awful this film is . you elicit no sympathy for either character , and only wish their comeuppance would speed along . only worth watching for schwimmer 's moustache .		2		0
it did n't take long to see the obvious in here : nice cinematography , attractive cast and an unbelievable `` propaganda piece '' - one of the worst i have ever seen , and i 've seen many . folks , this was not really about `` chocolate . '' that was just a cover-up for the cultural agenda advanced by the screen writers . here are just some of the things in the film -lrb- facts not opinion -rrb- : all the catholics in this small french town are shown to be pious which translates to filmmakers - as portrayed in this movie - as `` narrow-minded , stuffy , puritanical , nasty , almost illiterate , etc. . the mayor i pictured eve more so , as some kind of reactionary . the young priest , of course , is a big villain , too . according to the screenplay here , what 's the remedy for this town full of these religious people ? a liberal woman who would never be stoop to attending church with these nasties , so , of course , this poor little liberated thinker is under attack from these right wingers for producing `` sinful '' chocolate in a cute little shoppe ... and during lent , too ! this left wing cook is under attack from priests , the mayor , religious citizens - all portrayed as `` bad '' people . you have to almost see this to believe it , it 's so exaggerated and ludicrous . the movie does n't offer much in the way of subtleties , in this regard . too bad , because they did effectively coat this propaganda piece with nice cinematography and made all the chocolate look so good you could almost taste it . i wonder how many people went out and bought some after viewing this film ?		2		0
these so called `` zombies '' make frankenstein 's monster seem like jurassic park raptors -- within seconds fangs bite flesh and the undead transition occurs , resembling an epileptic seizure in double time . thankfully brad pitt 's family man gerry , after being caught in a traffic jam turned zombie attack , can figure things out along the way . he once worked for the government so he has an edge on doomed humanity , all targets for the hyperactive vampire-like creatures . much of the action occurs as quickly as the antagonists -- not so much the usual modern style shaky cam but with more of a movement that may cause seasickness , especially in 3d . yet much of the film has a brooding , mellow gerry going to various cities , including north korea and jerusalem : his mission is to figure out what virus is causing all the bedlam , and , most importantly , if there 's a possible cure . after a few big battles , one involving a `` zombies '' climbing a giant wall and using their bodies for leverage , followed by a die hard style scrap in a high flying airplane , we 're brought down to earth for a more personal standoff ... gerry -lrb- the only character that means anything -rrb- winds up at a scientific research center where he figures out how to possibly save the human race . the idea is creative and finally there 's a more contained and suspenseful urgency -- one intrepid man against only a handful of determined zombies . too bad they act like chickens and are completely laughable even at their most dangerous ... but at least the movie winds down to a situation we can be part of , far exceeding the overlong buildup which felt like watching war unfold on a cable news station .		2		0
i was having a great time for about 10 minutes there . first there was the trailer for `` starsky & hutch '' , a modern take-off of the 70 's cop show , starring ben stiller and owen wilson in the title roles and snoop dogg as huggy bear . it sounded lame to me until i saw this trailer , which was very funny and suggests that it could be a really intelligent spoof in the mold of the great , underrated `` undercover brother '' if done right . then came the new , longer trailer for `` eternal sunshine of the spotless mind '' , which just keeps looking better and better to me . it 's a surreal comedy/drama from director michel gondry -lrb- who has directed some truly brilliant music videos for artists like bjork , foo fighters , and the chemical brothers -rrb- , and it stars jim carrey , kate winslet , kirsten dunst , mark ruffalo , elijah wood , and tom wilkinson . looks awesome . then came `` van helsing '' . not too much to say about that one , except that it has a look that 's similar to `` the league of extraordinary gentlemen '' , and i did n't want to see that either . finally , there was the great new trailer for the remake of `` dawn of the dead '' , a movie that i was actually lucky enough to see a test screening of and it 's pretty damn awesome . so i was having a good time ... and then `` along came polly '' started . honestly , this movie is barely worth talking about because it 's so totally lame and predictable . the characters played by ben stiller and jennifer aniston are so thinly drawn that they do n't even seem like real people , just markers being nudged down an extremely familiar path by a screenplay that exists in a dimension beyond cliche . stiller plays reuben feffer , who is pretty much the exact same character he always plays in movies like this , and aniston 's polly is such a ghost of a character that she only has one personality trait that i could pick out . she 's wishy-washy . that 's it , that 's all there is to polly . because of this , when they finally get together at the end -lrb- oops ! did i spoil the suspense ? -rrb- there is no emotional connection with the audience whatsoever . the reaction is more like `` oh , they got back together . whatever '' . also , i 'm all for toilet humor when it 's done correctly -lrb- like in `` there 's something about mary '' , the movie that this is obviously trying to copy -rrb- , but here it 's weak , desperate , and makes the movie feel even cheaper . there is one good thing . philip seymour hoffman supplies a good number of laughs -lrb- pretty much the only ones in the movie -rrb- as reuben 's lecherous best friend sandy , a former child star who is oblivious to his own foolishness . but even he is occasionally hamstrung by the terrible script . well hey , at least the trailers before it were fun .		2		0
stealth is set in the near future where three top navy pilots lieutenant ban gannon -lrb- josh lucas -rrb- , lieutenant kira wade -lrb- jessica biel -rrb- & lieutenant henry purcell -lrb- jamie foxx -rrb- have been specially trained to fly the advanced talon stealth fighter jet . they are the best of the best but their commanding officer captain george cummings -lrb- sam shepard -rrb- feels they can be even better & adds a new fourth member to the team , a super advanced unmanned stealth fighter jet powered by artificial intelligence called edi or extreme deep invader . after a mission in rangoon edi is struck bu lightening which causes the intelligence to malfunction , then while on a combat mission in tajikistan to eliminate some terrorists edi disobeys orders & destroys a nuke missile which then sends a poisonous radioactive cloud to a nearby town killing 150,000 innocent civilians . the team are ordered to retrieve edi in one piece ... directed by rob cohen i have to say that i really disliked stealth , hollywood gets a lot of stick for making silly soulless action films that are all about spectacle rather than story or credibility & stealth is maybe the worst offender of this i have ever seen . the script is terrible , the character 's are amongst the worst & most unlikable i can remember . the whole american military patriotic flag waving heroism where the cocky pilots have a smart answer for everything & there 's even a horrible moment on an aircraft carrier with the naval officers on board cheering & smiling as they take-off in a really slushy show of american military sentiment . i hated everyone in this , i really wanted kira to get killed & by the way what made her or anybody else think the north koreans would have killed her anyway ? as far as i could tell the american slut was the only one killing anyone . each of the main character 's get to make a pathetic speech about war , how it should n't be turned into a video game -lrb- which ironically is precisely what stealth does -rrb- & the moral ethics but they are full of fake patriotic sentiment that made me feel sick at times & are so badly written & acted it comes across as laughable . the bad guy 's are all the usual clichés , from corrupt military & government officials -lrb- what was their plan anyway ? is it ever made clear ? -rrb- to the middle eastern terrorists to the pesky russians to the evil south koreans who are so obviously evil & deserve to be shot down & killed because they do n't love america . at almost two hours long stealth felt like it went on forever , the story is just plain insulting -lrb- blatantly disobeying orders is considered ok , someone falls thousands of feet along with burning debris into some trees & has no major injuries & is able to outrun the north korean army for hours , the use of fighter jets to take out terrorists with no ground support , plane fuel floating in the air in a perfect circle , flying between mountains at supersonic speed is easy -rrb- & the errors in real world physics & geography -lrb- plane fly between continents & countries in what seems like minutes on one tank of fuel -rrb- is just lazy . stealth is packed with cgi computer effects & most are pretty good but the action is n't , i do n't know but i just found constant shots of people in jets & then a shot of the jet flying through the air got really boring . the fact that almost everyone talks to everyone else through radios also made me feel like there was no real interaction between them . probably a flashy cgi filled mixture of firefox -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , blue thunder -lrb- 1983 -rrb- & top gun -lrb- 1986 -rrb- i found myself feeling very bored & detached from the action . to give it some credit the explosions are nice but that 's about it . there 's a lot of macho posturing too with seemingly endless scenes of aircraft carriers & fighter planes in action , again surely it 's an american patriotic thing . some of the action scenes are dumb , blowing a office building up in the middle of the densely populated rangoon with no civilian casualties is just absurd for example . with a budget of about $ this was one of the biggest box-office flops ever , even adding all the overseas totals together as well stealth failed to make it past the $ 100,000,000 mark . ouch . the acting is bad all round , jessica biel ca n't act & jamie foxx had the good sense to be killed off before the hour mark . stealth is a film that i have taken a particular dislike to , i just hate everything about it apart from some of the nice explosions & cgi effects . the story is awful & just plain stupid , the sentiment & patriotic slush is sickening & at almost two hours long it 's really boring .		2		0
another fantasy movie about marines . any resemblance to the truth is pure coincidence . first , recon platoons are not part of regiments or battalions . recon platoons are part of the division headquarters . recon platoons are made up of the best of the best and no recon platoon would have ever looked as sloppy as this one did in the beginning . second , companies are commanded by captains , not majors . when the major reported to the colonel as `` graduated from the naval academy , 1971 '' would never happen . the colonel already knows the major 's background . also every marine knows the medal of honor ribbon and every one seeing the gunny with the ribbon would have immediately recognized that he was a medal of honor winner and would have immediately given him the highest respect , including the major . the major would have been so glad to have the gunny in his outfit that he would been kissing his butt . as for the gunny firing an ak-47 at his troops to get them accustomed to hearing it fire - pure fantasy . he would have been busted out of the marine corps if that happened . what he would have done is take his troops to a firing range and under controlled conditions fired the weapon down range . this is done often with units to familiarize them with the sound of enemy weapons . as for the accidental firing on the shooting range , unlikely . by the time a marine is selected for a recon platoon , he is already highly trained in weapons and he is not likely to make a boot camp mistake . i could go on and on about what a crappy movie this is but enough is enough .		2		0
the plot for this movie is supposed to involve an asbestos removal team that go into a creepy . the movie sounded good enough , but then i watched it . it 's first flaw is in dragging its audience laboriously through the arguments of the team members as they take on the almost impossible task of removing hazardous building materials from a structure that is monstrous -lrb- no pun intended -rrb- . one team member , through sessions -lrb- hence the title -rrb- , recounts the trauma of one of the patients that lived at the facility . we understand that they have multiple personalities that lead to murder . about this time , one of the other team members winds up missing . we when see him later on it is difficult to know if he is alive or a ghost or something . i figured him for a ghost . then the film begins to rapidly proceed through the remaining events , almost at breakneck speed . killing after killing occurs at the pace of session 9 's recording , supposedly as some eerie backdrop to tell us how these killing are happening . the film tries to trick you into thinking it 's a ghost -lrb- not altogether untrue -rrb- , but -lrb- spoiler -rrb- then reveals its antagonist to be that of one of the team members . he is slaying all of his buddies because he 's possessed or something . this transformation occurs so quickly and without much explanation that is appears lame . in fact , i thought i was going to seem something further or some spirit or an elaboration on a reason for the change that i mistakenly kept watching . the ending is ultimately pathetic in the possessed wandering around as some sort of troubled invalid . repeated shots -lrb- like that on the movie 's cover -rrb- are given of a chair sitting in the light . this is a reference to the psychological counseling sessions held . but the director focuses on it frequently as to suggest more than the obvious , which is only so because it 's easy enough to associate . in retrospect , he probably should have had the chair grow wings or jump hoops or something . bottom line - this movie does not pay off . and there 's hardly any built up or suspense until toward the end . then that peters out pretty fast as the film heads toward its ridiculously lame ending . a good plot was there for the taking , but this director looks like he did his best to miss all the right opportunities .		2		0
`` fred claus '' sounds like a really corny movie , but with a cast led by vince vaughn it ca n't be bad , right ? wrong ! vince vaughn only added to the problem . this is a ridiculous movie that never knew quite what it was , and rarely succeeded in making me laugh . the plot of this trainwreck is quite simple . santa 's younger brother fred needs money , so he goes to the north pole for a few days to get $ 50,000 bucks . meanwhile , santa is going to be shut down by kevin spacey 's character , who was actually the funniest character in the movie . there 's a long list of problems with this movie , but i 'll just name a few things i hated . this had cartoon sound effects during fights , which only works in cartoons , and makes live action stupid and unfunny . vince vaughn talked too much , and this movie felt like it was poorly ad libbed the entire time . the movie was very inconsistent in what it was . it starts off like a fairy tale , then switches to an annoying comedy . midway , for about ten minutes it actually feels like a horror movie , before it switches to corny kid 's movie . on top of all that , it just was n't funny and the special effects were bad . with that said , this did make me laugh every once in a while , but not enough to make this worth watching . overall this was a dumb , and unfunny movie , not worthy of vince vaughn and paul giammati 's work . my rating : 1/2 out of **** . 110 mins . pg for mild language		2		0
i went to see the film despite the bad reviews , and perhaps motivated by the fact that cohen has made me laugh a lot in the past . the aggressive marketing of the film and the ubiquity of bruno at any premier at any tv station did not discourage me , although this sort of thing would have been enough not to watch any other movie . i was sure that what what i had heard about this `` mockumentary '' was unfortunately true . the thing is that bruno , the character , is well drawn and portrayed by cohen , but the script is so weak , the improvisation is so prepared that the viewer feels cheated . there is no social criticism of homophobes , there is no real risk taken , nor real provocation , the sort of clever provocation that shocks not because of its obscenity but because it has a points , sarcasm and wittiness . the scenes are rather gross even for liberated open-minded people who would watch nudity and sexual scenes without problem . bad taste is what we find here , and for the sake of nothing . it 's a shame that a character like bruno , who has potential , gets ruined for the lack of cohen 's inventive and real humor . it seems that he tried to compensate his lack of creativity with the marketing . that is a real pity , as cohen can be extremely funny ninety nine per cent of the people at the cinema did not laugh , me included . one of the worst films i 've ever seen . i swear .		2		0
there 's an interesting subplot in `` superman iii '' in which superman goes bad -lrb- complete with 5 o'clock shadow and dark colors -rrb- . beyond that point of interest , this film is a disaster . for no discernible reason , the powers-that-be decided to turn superman into a comedy . central to that is the casting of richard pryor as the who creates trouble for the man of steel -lrb- but he 's just the stooge , not a villain -rrb- . also central is an overall comedic tone that turns everything -lrb- read : everything -rrb- into a ha-ha . the opening credits sequence is a series of sight gags , pratfalls and comic mischief , turning the citizens of metropolis into hapless buffoons . it 's this general attitude that threads through the duration of the movie , turning the sequel to arguably the greatest superman film ever made -lrb- ii -rrb- into a grueling slog of cheap laughs . not cool . to his credit , reeve plays the character straight as always , making the big `` save the day '' setpieces welcoming respites from the film 's idea of comedy . but it was a sinking ship at the script stage . fraught with pacing issues , `` superman iii '' has a two-hour runtime that feels like three . and there 's not really a bad guy . sure , there 's robert vaughn playing a poor lex luthor imitation , but he 's just a money-hungry tycoon . he 's no threat to superman . and the majority of pryor 's presence is just uncomfortable to watch . young ` uns should take heed that the man 's comedic charms are best seen in his stand-up routine . not here . it 's unfortunate the salkinds decided to go in this direction with the series . it did n't have to be a gagfest written around the star presence of pryor , and it did n't have to feel so cheap . what 's most upsetting about watching `` superman iii '' -lrb- aside from waiting for something to happen -rrb- is that lester and co. delivered a pie-in-the-face to the heart and verisimilitude of the donner film . for that reason , this is the worst of the series , for me . even `` quest for peace '' had good intentions . this was just a cheap shot . 2/10		2		0
in a snowing day , the spoiled and stubborn max builds an igloo on the other side of his sidewalk . when his older sister claire and her friends arrive , max throws snowballs in the group and they begin a war . max hides in his igloo , but the teenagers jump over it and destroy his shelter . the upset max wets claire 's room with snow and then he does not obey his mother and bites her . he runs away home wearing his wolf costume and mentally travels to an imaginary world inhabited with wild things that elect the boy their king . i have tried to watch `` where the wild things are '' for three nights , but i slept in all attempts . today i tried for the fourth time and guess what happened ? once again i slept . when i woke up , i decided to try again and i finally succeeded . what an awfully boring and overrated film this crap is ! what is its target regarding audiences , adults or children ? i believe neither adults nor children will enjoy this annoying and pointless film . the boy max is probably autistic and irritates with his attitudes ; even the music score is bothersome . better off if i had slept again . my vote is two . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` onde os '' -lrb- `` where the monsters live '' -rrb-		2		0
ahhh , just what the world was missing ... a naff remake of one of john carpenter 's poorer ` classics ' ! this totally unnecessary update of the fairly lame 80s spook movie blows on so many levels : the acting , the direction , the cgi fx , the plot-hole ridden script . i had heard a lot of bad things about the fog before settling down to watch it and asked myself ` could it really be that bad ? ' . you betcha -- this movie is awful !!! taking the original premise of carpenter 's flick -- ghosts take revenge on the ancestors of their murderers -- and adding several pointless plot threads that go nowhere , director rupert wainwright presents a lifeless mess of a film that fails to be either scary or exciting . the wooden leads -lrb- tom welling of smallville fame and maggie grace of lost -rrb- have obviously been selected for their looks rather than their talent and both give dreadful performances . meanwhile , selma blair tries her best to emulate adrienne barbeau 's character in the original , but her weak imitation ends up grating on the nerves . if you check the reviews of those who gave this a high rating , it appears that they either a -rrb- think tom welling is hot , b -rrb- think maggie grace or selma blair are hot , or c -rrb- are too young to know any better . seasoned horror fans , on the other hand , recognise bilge when they see it . with no gore , no effective scares and no atmosphere , the fog is a horror movie without any horror .		2		0
a terrible and unpleasant sequel to the surprise hit from 1984 . though it reassembles most of the cast from the original , including eddie murphy in the role that made him a big-screen movie star , all of the other elements that made the first one so enjoyable are gone . director tony scott seems to be absolutely clueless about what made the first one so popular and fresh -- in other words , the comedy -- and instead focuses on aggressive violence and action . the song `` shakedown '' was nominated for an academy award , but otherwise the film does n't even boast as good a soundtrack as the original . grade : d		2		0
cobra is either 80 's action as its worst or its best , depending on the way you look at it . there really is no need to speak about plot , as this movie makes as much sense as , well , blind watching a tv . there 's nothing in the film that could be as logic or sense in the story ; it just happens and you are amazed of the lack of intelligence . if you can name a cliché , the changes are that cobra has it . there 's bad blood between cops , traitors and nonsense murderers . there even is silly sidekick , and `` clever '' throws . and it all is crowned with a classic 80 's soundtrack of the hottest bands of the hour . and yet i could n't care less . the bottom line is , cobra is garbage . idiotic piece of trash action directed in the midst of the 80 's . a movie that would have been better left undone . score : 2/10 . the film is just too illogical and the actors do very bad job , but really , no one could lift the script into any level of adequacy . camp value : 7/10 . the ending speech by the alone is such a camp moment , that if it does n't make you laugh nothing will .		2		0
a group of college students are invited to be on an internet reality show called created by freddie harris -lrb- busta rhymes -rrb- . the idea of the show is to spend one night in the old house of michael myers -lrb- brad loree -rrb- . the problem is that michael myers is still on the loose and joins them in his old house for another massacre . viewers watch from a party as each student dies on camera . this is an original idea for a horror movie but is done no better than any other low-budget horror film . just the very thought of busta rhymes fighting michael myers is extremely amusing to me , but the fight takes place . the movie may have been funny but it was funny without trying to be which destroys the whole point . the murders were actually done decently well but the acting and writing made up for the missing flaws . overall , the movie was incredibly dull and stupid and leaves the viewers asking `` what the hell ? '' i do not recommend this movie to anyone including die-hard halloween fans .		2		0
what the hell is going on in this movie ? apparently , someone forgot that there can only be one . both versions , theatrical and `` renegade '' , suck . now , the renegade version does suck slightly less . the other world plot line is abandoned , thank god , but the main problem is still there . you have to assume that god or whatever force has some rule over this world and you ca n't just have someone get `` the prize '' if they are n't `` the one '' . so what the hell was supposed to have happened at the end of the first film ? false alarm ? the improved renegade version has the new immortals coming from the future . yay , i care . the only thing worth watching is michael ironside . no one does wide eyed crazy quite like him and this is his field day .		2		0
i rented this movie because my husband adores westerns and i adore pierce brosnan and liam neeson , well most of the time ; but definitely not this time . what a lame , ridiculous excuse for a movie . thank god i did n't have to fork over big bucks to see it at a theatre , i would have screamed out loud and demanded my money back . the most annoying thing about this movie is that it took too long for the explanation of the infamous title `` seraphim falls ' . and when they did it was gone very poorly , no drama , no heartbreak for either character and a wasted angie harmon . this movie should go down as one of the worst westerns of all time . 2/10		2		0
it 's obvious that a lot of money was spent making ` battlefield earth ' , but none of it appears to have spent to good effect . in particular , the screenplay itself appears to have cost $ , maybe less ... i have bought $ 2.99 comic books written by warren ellis and alan moore that blow the doors off be in terms of plot , dialog , mood , characterization , and general entertainment value . ellis 's recent limited series ` ocean ' alone contains 10 times more entertainment value than this 2 hour bath in . i think we can all agree that blame rests squarely with john travolta and director roger christian , who both seemed to have forgotten everything they ever knew about making good movies : rule number one : never adapt anything by l. ron hubbard -lrb- or whatever ghost writer churned out this crap for him -rrb- . the be books were the worst kind of space opera hack work in the first place . e.e. ` doc ' smith did this kind of thing better 40 years before in the ` lensman ' series . rule number two : even in science fiction , you ca n't throw believability out the window , like asking the audience to believe that harrier jets could fly after 1000 years , or that cavemen could use 1000 year old technology to beat alien space conquerers who kicked the crap out of that 1000 year old technology in the first place back when it was new and used by expert professionals . rule number 3 : barry pepper can not carry a film when john travolta is hogging center stage and camping things up like the ziegfield follies . nothing against barry , who is a fine , if limited actor . i hope his career survived this bomb and the tanking of ` knockaround guys ' . rule number 4 : use the same camera trick as a dramatic device too many time -lrb- tilting the camera 45 degrees to connote dramatic intensity or an action climax -rrb- and the viewer will suspect creative bankruptcy . rule number 5 : if you are lucky enough to have forest whittaker in your film , give him something to do , and do not dress him up as a klingon refugee from a kiss concert . added one star because i feel sorry for barry pepper and ca n't give forest whitaker just one star no matter what he 's in .		2		0
this is the type of movie you really only want to watch if you have very low expectations at the moment when you 're watching it . basically it 's interesting to see because of ashley judd 's performance , which is a case of a good performance wasted on a mediocre , if not poor , film . sam jackson shows up in this one too , although pretty much anyone could have played his role just as well up until the last few minutes . and andy garcia is the love interest -- who knows why , considering he looks terrible and his unappealing cop character says things like `` i wish i had been there '' when his female partner -lrb- judd -rrb- tells him she passed out drunk the night before . the `` mystery '' in this film is extremely transparent -- i guessed `` whodunit '' less than halfway through the film . but i enjoyed watching the film on a certain visual level because judd was so fascinating , her eyes really accented by the short haircut , and because there were some nice images of some of my favorite bay area places like the palace of fine arts -lrb- which has actually been closed for about a decade since some chunks fell off in a small quake , so realistically judd 's character could not have been wandering around in there -rrb- . other than that honestly it 's a poor film and i have little to say about it . some of the scenes were so awkwardly done that i found them literally laughable . for instance why did judd 's character continue to drink wine every night even though she passed out and woke up to find her lovers dead afterwards . we were supposed to be shocked that someone was spiking her drink ? ugh , just horrible writing in this film . judd gave a good performance and that kept me watching the film , even though i 've never seen her in anything before . they seemed to be fashioning her as a latter-day jodie foster for this film and she pulled it off reasonably well despite phoned-in performances from garcia and jackson .		2		0
i like action movies . if stuff is blowing up and there 's some hand-to-hand combat , who cares if there 's a plot ? this one , though , is really bad -- cheesy but unlike conan the barbarian not in a good way , and takes itself too seriously . the stunts are not interesting enough to make up for it . as a sample : why do the badguys drive cars that glow with green lights ? who should see this film : -- those whose favorite film was gone in 60 seconds -- car racing buffs who 've heard their favorite car is in the movie -- those who like the action in tv wrestling i 'll give it a 4 out of 10 which is generous in my opinion .		2		0
what a mess of a movie , the whole idea of micheal douglas being the subject of a game is a good idea , but it just doesnt seem to work . it never really gives much suspense or excitement . micheal douglas plays the same boring victim he has played in all of his other movies in the past 15 years -lrb- with the of falling down `` 1993 '' . sean penn should have only been billed as a special appearence because he is only in the movie for about 15 minutes at most . overall `` the game '' is a predictable and boring mess that i will never play again . 3 out of 10 .		2		0
`` in the cut '' follows an english teacher 's sex life in nyc . unless you 're into lots of sex and murder , you should skip this turkey . it is a depressing muddle with nudity , simulated sex acts , body parts , lots of blood . be ready for the new `` hollywood '' ending which has been substituted . grade = `` d ''		2		0
a technically adventurous and hugely pretentious piece of animation from richard linklater . it has no real ` plot ' but is rather like a series of ideas without a structure to sustain them . to call it different is n't , in this case , a compliment and while the visuals are remarkable they are often remarkably annoying - the wavy animation might induce a feeling of sea-sickness . not everyone was wowed by linklater 's double-bill `` before sunrise '' and `` before sunset '' , -lrb- he made this three years before '' ... sunset '' -rrb- . many people chalked those down to an ethan hawke ego-trip , -lrb- i was n't one of them -rrb- . an animated hawke turns up here , very briefly i 'm glad to say , together with an animated julie delpy but this time i wanted to rub him out , literally . come to think of it , there was n't anyone on screen i did n't want to erase . these are the kind of people that , if you knew them , would turn most people into reclusive hermits . you keep watching to see how , if at all , linklater will develop his ideas in purely visual terms but if this were not an animated film and had real actors instead of what are , fundamentally , their cartoon selves , you would definitely switch off long before the end .		2		0
the karate kid , part three -lrb- 1989 -rrb- . well , well , well . the clock has struck twelve on this franchise . the series has finally ran out of gas and the cash cow is gone . thankfully the last film of the trilogy has arrived . the karate `` kid '' has to defend his title . even though this takes place a year after the first movie , `` young '' danny has aged tremendously . he has a dilemma , defend his karate title or go to school . everything seems to go along mundanely until an old nemesis comes back to haunt danny . the series has been ran into the ground and every single story line has been used . this is the worst of the series . everyone looks tired or bored and they all go through the motions . recommended for die hards fans only .		2		0
joy ride 1 really was n't that bad of a movie . it 's nice to be able to see scenes in horror movies , i.e. in full daylight -lrb- also see the devil 's rejects . -rrb- and joy ride 2 : dead ahead really was n't that bad either . that being said , i was glad it was direct to dvd . the way it started off -lrb- red flags shot straight up : here we go again ! back to texas -lrb- yes , this was utah , i know -rrb- and back to the chainsaw family seemed to be the setup -rrb- and the way the internet punk transformed in the final act , were the extremely bad parts . if you can make it past the opening , and bear through the closing , it was n't a terrible psycho preying on lost 20-something lost kids . the acting was okay -lrb- aside from the changed emo boy -rrb- , dialogue was n't too awful -lrb- miss the ted `` jame ` buffalo bill ' '' voice over , but this one was close enough -rrb- and suspense was good enough to give it one watch . after a day of watching saw v followed by joy ride 2 -- i would say they 're both mediocre horror sequels that are worth watching , if just at home .		2		0
almost from the very first moment -lrb- in fact , before , because you must know a bit about the story when you decide to watch it -rrb- you know where this is going in every way . you know where it 's going in terms of character development , in terms of the requisite romance , in terms of the plant 's fate . sure , there are a few specifics that need to be filled in , but there are no real surprises . now , even with a complete lack of originality , a movie can succeed if it gets the intangibles -lrb- for lack of a better word -rrb- right - casting , the heartwarming cuteness that you expect from such a story , believable characters . if those things work , the movie can work , as predictable as it may be . unfortunately ... on the upside , there were a handful of those heartwarmingly cute moments , as lucy -lrb- renee zellweger -rrb- comes to terms with her new life in the town of new ulm , minnesota . lucy 's a high-powered corporate executive based in miami , looking to make it to the top , when she gets sent to new ulm in the middle of winter on a corporate hatchet assignment - to get rid of the local plant -lrb- what they made was never really clear to me . -rrb- she 's a fish out of water character : the city girl who knows nothing about small town life ; the florida girl who knows nothing about winter ; the rich girl who knows nothing about working stiffs . so , obviously , the movie is about her adjusting to this life . in that adjustment , we find a handful of heartwarming moments - particularly the scene where she joins the townsfolk around the christmas tree to sing `` o come , all ye faithful , '' and the scene in which she helps ted 's daughter get ready for the valentine 's day dance . on the downside , there were n't enough of those heartwarming moments . zellweger -lrb- who i usually enjoy -rrb- also disappointed . usually , even if the movie is less than stellar , her performances impress me . here , i felt that she was miscast ; never coming across as believable as lucy . mind you , that was a larger problem than just lucy . there was a sense of unbelievability to the characters in general . i admit that i have little experience of small-town minnesota . when i was about 8 , i think i spent a night with my family in a motel in duluth . that 's my minnesota experience , which does n't really qualify as small-town , rural minnesota . still , the stereotypes in this movie seemed overdone . extreme stereotypes can work - the same sort of thing was done with small-town minnesota , for example , in `` grumpy old men '' -lrb- but that movie was at least humorous . -rrb- in this , to me , the stereotypes came across as less than flattering and less than fun . there really was n't much in this that would lead me to recommend it - not even the presence of renee zellweger , who 's made a few weak movies watchable for me in the past .		2		0
the worst thing about this dumb movie is not that it has cgi deer . or that the zombies have superpowers . or that a washed-out , formerly great director made ial just to make yet more money with mass-appeal garbage . or that the main character talks about bob marley in a moment of predictable hollywood pc-ness . or that it 's much worse than both `` the omega man '' and `` last man on earth '' , hence a pointless remake . or that it portrays scientists as a root of all evil . or that it presents religion as something a person should cling to when faced with hordes of unconvincing cgi zombies . or that the zombies are described as dumb , and yet they seem rather organized and cunning , in part . or that there is a reference to another piece of crap , `` shreck '' . or that the conversations with the mannequin are idiotic and dull . nor is the biggest problem that the mannequin acts better than will smith . the worst thing about this movie is that will smith is in it . `` i am legend `` ary in making crap movies . is the air in this movie , too ? i think they should try to cgi the air in future films because quite frankly the air in most movies looks kind of ... off . just not real enough . and while they 're at it , they might as well cgi the air in ridley scott 's head , too .		2		0
the years have conferred cruel nicknames upon it , superman 4 f * ck 's sake ! , superman iv : rest in peace , the one i did n't see and so on . in fact part 3 's annette o'toole -lrb- lana lang -rrb- delivered its most devastating critique , remarking simply `` they made a forth one ? '' yes , these have rounded on the third like a whore to a city trader 's wallet and though the criticism should be immense , it is n't the horror some would tell you it is ... though it 's pretty close . so how did a movie that made $ in domestic adjusted dollars do a jaws , and spawn such a miserable third sequel ? what was it about the year 1987 , did someone kill all the best filmmakers that year ? the quest for peace plays like a bloody knife in your husband 's raincoat , suggesting we should be looking for bodies rather than blame . blame is the game though so here we go -- having killed the secret of their success by firing richard donner and his script doctor tom , the salkinds , those icelandic imbeciles with next to no understanding of what made superman work , had cocked up superman iii by turning it into a camp escapade with richard lester throwing the custard pies . imagining that the audience had lost interest in supes rather than hating what they 'd done to him in the 1983 instalment , they soiled the suite further by inflicting supergirl on an audience still licking its wounds . when that failed the of santa clause : the movie decided to get out of the and sold the rights to golan and , hollywood moguls from , er , israel , with all the creative zeal of a lobotomised . 1987 was a big year for the gg 's as no-one referred to them on account of ' rumoured resemblance to a horse . they were also making masters of the universe , another ` hot property ' but the gruesome twosome were spreading themselves a little thin -- in short , the money was n't quite pouring in as they might like . with other projects requiring life support , these geniuses took much of the $ 40m warners had given them for superman and spent it ... on something else !!! possibly on air fares to israel . the logic is obvious -- why would you need to spend money on a superman movie ? its total lack of visual effects or international locations would make it ripe for downsizing . thus as the reeve was lured back in exchange for amongst other things , story input , the budget was halved and the result speaks for itself -- on a shoestring ? the crew on this one could n't afford string ... or shoes . the total and soul destroying shame of superman iv is that it could and should have been a wonderful swansong for reeve in the title role . his nuclear disarmament theme , much derided , was in fact an honourable stab at giving the man of steel a meaty , real world problem to solve as well as returning the series to the more serious tone of the first two films . unfortunately the script has no intention of doing serious , generally veering from infantile to ridiculous . it 's the kind of screenplay that says ` we 're not getting paid enough here ' -lrb- which they probably were n't -rrb- but worse , ` we do n't give a stuff ' . but poor though it is -- little wit or character development to be found here , what really kills superman iv is the aforementioned budget . even at a truncated 86 minutes it 's embarrassing to watch a movie which feels so amateurishly produced and poorly made . the visual effects are , for the most part , atrocious . they would have dated instantly ; in fact much of the work could be bettered today using the most basic effects software available . unfair perhaps but given the quality of sfx at this time , the lack of money spent on them is unforgivable . if anything is going to pull you out of a movie , no matter how good the story or likable the characters , its seeing the strings -- in this case literally . reeve as ever is impossible to dislike and makes the worst of it bearable but the sheer of it , milton doubling for new york for example -lrb- ! -rrb- , is enough to incite you to crush golan 's globus ' with extreme prejudice . from the rubble there 's also a fairly decent score by john williams and star trek 's alexander courage but even there it sounds as though the budget did n't stretch to an orchestra , the music having a tinny , synthesised quality to it in places . brutalised in production , murdered in the editing suite with over 40 minutes excised -lrb- but in sympathy to the editor he must have had plenty of unusable footage , much of which he 'd reluctantly have to have locked into the final cut -rrb- this last superman -lrb- not counting returns as it does n't count this -rrb- is an abject lesson in poor production management and how to slay a cash cow with utter unmitigated contempt . christ , reeve probably laughed harder on the day he was paralysed .		2		0
