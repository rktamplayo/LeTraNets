leland follows the story of leland p. fitzgerald -lrb- ryan gosling -rrb- , a disaffected teenager who has apparently murdered a severely retarded peer , the brother of a girl he was dating . the issue is not whether he did it or not -- leland admits to it , straight away -- but rather , why . interestingly , rather than a crime drama , leland becomes a character story , examining why people do what they do -- not necessarily the easiest ground to till . and leland features the required indie group of screwed-up people . aside from the title character , there 's also pearl -lrb- don cheadle -rrb- , who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who sees straight off that leland is different . we meet leland 's distant and egotistical father -lrb- kevin spacey in an extended cameo -rrb- , who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did . but the real come out when we immerse ourselves in the , the family of the retarded child . first , there 's leland 's girlfriend becky -lrb- jena malone -rrb- , a drug addict who ca n't keep herself clean ; her sister julie -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , perhaps the most normal person in the film , who merely seeks to get away from it all ; and allen harris -lrb- chris klein -rrb- , a young man who lives with the and is julie 's boyfriend . lastly , there 's ryan -lrb- michael welch -rrb- , whom all the others call goofball , who can not communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings . leland focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist , but the movie slowly -- occasionally too slowly -- burrows into everyone 's lives , asking the chief question , why do people do what they do ? while leland discusses it openly in a journal pearl allows him to keep , examining notions of good and bad and personal responsibility , all the characters at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another 's , perhaps the most basic choice any human can make . and the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices , and the consequences of them . in the beginning of the film , you 're simply struck by the depth of the cast . spacey . cheadle . gosling . michelle williams . even chris klein -- these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in , and putting them all together makes for a heady brew . for a space in the middle the film seems to stall , sputtering along as it unfolds ; it looks for a while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers . but when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its stride and come together , leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of film-making . leland 's explanation of the world and his actions , in the end , bring every story into focus , and all the investment you 've made in the film pays off . saying ryan gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice . at this point in his career it 's redundant -- this is one of the finest young actors working today , and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thought-provoking protagonist . gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting ; he has to face off most of the film opposite don cheadle , whom we know has the goods , and he not only holds his own , he elevates cheadle 's game as well . cheadle himself is in top notch form , imbuing pearl with a fully-rounded humanity -- for good and bad . spacey is kind of one-note , but that 's the character , and he handles it excellently . i was surprised by chris klein ; with this level of acting , i thought he would be buried in the mix , but he gives probably the turn of his career so far . terrific work all around . leland is a bit of a downer , and again , it 's draggy in spots . but it finishes strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer -lrb- on this one , anyway -rrb- . there 's also a subtle commentary on racism in the film -lrb- in leland 's first day in juvenile hall class , he 's the only white person in the room -rrb- that , like much of the movie , is very effectively handled . i would n't go so far as to call this required viewing -- some might find it too slow or too odd -- but i thought it was one of the better films i 've seen in a while , far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there . i 'd recommend it -- with the above caveats -- if for no other reason than to watch gosling further perfect his craft .		10		1
this is the greatest historical movie ever as a graphic novel book . when i saw the preview i was going to see this movie no matter what . and when i saw it , i saw more than what i have seen . even if they extended they way the monsters looked it was great , the action , romance war they had in sparta . zack did his best in this movie , it blows your mind and makes you part of the movie . the may have more allies to help but were imperiled to the spartans . this is a great movie to learn what happen back in greece a long time ago . even the all mighty xerxes could n't kill them because they worked as a group , all the same moves turns and kills . they were as one , unlike the was great and had to have 10 stars , bravo 300 , your in my top .		10		1
one of the big blockbuster best sellers of the post world war ii years is james jones 's from here to eternity , a tale of the peacetime army in hawaii before pearl harbor . the book was definitely going to be made into a film and it was only a question of casting to make it a success . director fred zinneman had a good intuitive sense about casting here , even against type . the two principal female parts were done against type . deborah kerr who made a career of playing respectable women played a captain 's wife who 's drinking and playing around . not that husband philip ober is letting grass grow under his feet either , but kerr 's latest sexual exploit involves her with the first sergeant of her husband 's company , burt lancaster . donna reed , who up to that point was best known for being mary bailey in it 's a wonderful life , plays a prostitute here . a girl from the wrong side of the tracks , jilted by a rich boyfriend stateside , she 's in hawaii to make money and then go home and buy some respectability . she 's not looking for romance with any soldiers , but you ca n't plan these things . especially montgomery clift if he comes in your life . it 's been argued that this is clift 's greatest role and a case can sure be made for it . his character of robert e. lee pruitt is like so many who still join the army today , from small town america who have no future there and find a home in the armed services . what makes clift unique is that strong sense of individualism he ca n't control in an organization that does not encourage individuality . clift and lancaster are a great study in contrasts and that 's what drives from here to eternity . lancaster as sergeant milt warden is the ultimate professional soldier , held in the highest regard by his men . lancaster is someone who knows how to work the system , you see it in the way he manipulates his captain . of course he 's got to be a manipulator there since he 's having an affair with deborah kerr . he tries to protect clift from himself and ultimately fails . clift has transferred into an infantry company and he was at one time a boxer . but he blinded someone in a fight and quit boxing . philip ober who prides himself on having several champions in various weight classes worked to get clift in his company . clift upsets his plans by refusing to box so he has the various sergeants give him `` the treatment . '' clift 's best friend in the company is a tough street wise soldier from the big city named angelo maggio , played by frank sinatra . sinatra read the book and knew this part was for him . he did everything he had to do to get that part , including working for scale . at the time sinatra was considered a has been as singer and actor . sinatra was right on the money in terms of picking a role . his faith in himself and columbia pictures and fred zinneman 's faith in him netted him an oscar for best supporting actor , one of eight awards won by from here to eternity . by the way sinatra credited both lancaster and clift in helping him through this film as a dramatic actor . lancaster and sinatra did n't inhabit the same hollywood orbit , but they remained friends for life . the same could not be said for clift . allegedly , some five or six years after from here to eternity and after monty clift 's automobile accident while shooting raintree county , clift at some party at sinatra 's made a drunken pass at one of sinatra 's retainers . that got him kicked out of sinatra 's circle permanently . in fact from here to eternity was also the best picture of 1953 , with zinneman getting his second best director oscar in a row after the one he took home in 1952 for high noon . donna reed won for best supporting . burt lancaster and montgomery clift were both nominated for best actor , but split the vote allowing william holden to win for stalag 17 . another great acting job itself . and kerr was up for best actress , but lost to audrey hepburn for roman holiday . from here to eternity is a film loaded with good actors in small roles who got their first notice in this film . ernest borgnine , robert j. wilkie , claude akins , jack warden , mickey shaughnessy , all play various soldiers and each one is memorable . especially borgnine as the vicious sadistic sergeant of the stockade . tv 's superman was in from here to eternity also . george reeves who was looking to escape the typecasting from superman has a part as another sergeant who warns lancaster about deborah kerr . he gave a fine performance , but most of it wound up on the cutting room floor . that would have unforeseen tragic consequences . this is not any kind of glamorous army . these people are all too real and not very noble . the original novel was toned down quite a bit for the screen . but when the attack on pearl harbor comes , the men rise to the occasion , do their jobs in a more than competent manner and led by burt lancaster in that company . it 's these men who won that war in the pacific and the one in europe as well and from here to eternity despite the less than noble portrayals of them as individuals is a great tribute to them as a team .		10		1
so many have commented , some quite scholarly . there are few films that have been held up to such scrutiny as this one . my reactions are emotional , although i think i could wade in the same waters as some of my predecessors . my approach to movies is to take them as they come . i am so tired of all the talk about special effects that begin almost every review . if you have a high profile film , the special effects are treated as if they are some a form unto themselves , as if they were actually removed from the film . did n't like the special effects . did n't like the movie . sit down for a moment and look at this film . it 's wonderful that kubrick was able to do what he did with those effects , but the way this movie unfolds is so much more than that . this movie is there to portray a sense of the awe of the universe and the future of humankind based on the increments that have led us there . it is about a future that may occur . everyone is talking about movie being a disappointment after reading the book . folks , the movie came out before the book . the movie was originally based on a short story called `` the sentinel '' by arthur c. clarke . the movie borrows some of its thoughtfulness from `` childhood 's end , '' another clarke book which deals with similar issues about the ends of humankind and the transmigration of our being . if you are going to enjoy 2001 , you have to put away that fixation on the conventional science fiction of the day , with foam rubber aliens and armies of extra-terrestrial implements of destruction . take a look at star wars sometime -lrb- by the way , i think it 's a wonderful film -rrb- . it is really a space western , a world war ii airplane movie , with a rite of passage thrown in , and the obligatory soap opera stuff with luke and darth vader . no-one can hit anything with laser weapons . those storm troopers are the most worthless fighting force i have ever seen . it 's a fun movie , but when you look at true speculative science fiction , there is n't much to think about , no metaphysics , nothing much to occupy your mind after its over . 2001 sets out to be different and should n't be compared to star wars ; they are apples and oranges . this movie has some of the most breath taking images that stand there in silent space , just getting a reaction . if independence day is your thing and everything you see needs to copy it , do n't bother to see this movie .		10		1
richard attenborough 's career goes back to the 1940s , when he started in stage and film work . what a career it has been ! from the twisted teenage killer in brighton rock , to the clever soldier turned businessman in private 's progress and i 'm all right , jack ! , to other triumphs . but as an actor he is best known to modern movie goers as the brilliant cloning scientist of dinosaurs in the jurassic park films . he has also done well as a director of films like gandhi . he is now sir richard attenborough . it 's been quite a great career . in 1971 he appeared in one of his best remembered , and most chilling roles . he played john reginald christie , who from 1941 to 1952 murdered at least seven women by strangulation , slept with their corpses , and then buried the remains of most of them in a decrepit third rate house in the poverty area -lrb- at that time -rrb- known as notting hill in london . the address became notorious around the world - a negative opposite to the prime minister 's address of 10 downing street . so this film uses the title of that awful address : 10 rillington place . christie was one of several horrendous killers who popped up in that period : he is usually tied to neville george heath , a perverted sadist who horribly murdered and mutilated two women , and john george haigh , who disposed of six people -lrb- at least -rrb- for money , destroying their bodies in acid baths . heath and haigh tried to avoid hanging by insanity defenses but both failed . christie , a quiet , bald man -lrb- his best biographer , sir ludovic kennedy , said everything about him was seedy in the worst way -rrb- had pretensions of social superiority over his neighbors -lrb- mostly anglo - africans from the empire -rrb- . he was married -lrb- his wife was his last victim -rrb- . but what made this sordid character forever ultra-evil to the public was his testimony in 1951 at the trial of timothy evans , a slow-witted gentleman who roomed in christie 's home . evans , his wife beryl , and his baby daughter were living under the monster 's roof . beryl and the daughter were killed , and the police arrested evans after he made some remarks . but the police depended on the testimony of christie , and evans was convicted and sentenced to death . after christie 's arrest it slowly dawned on everyone that when evans denied his guilt on the scaffold , he was n't lying . it took decades , but evans was eventually declared `` rehabilitated '' -lrb- i.e. : innocent of the crimes he was hanged for -rrb- . the evans disaster was the first of a series in the 1950s that led to the british abandoning the death penalty . christie himself , when asked about the deaths of beryl and her baby , said `` the more the merrier . '' one hopes he `` enjoyed '' his jest - he was hanged in 1953 . attenborough is marvelously unsettling as the quiet , evil bald man who shocked the world . he is aided by john hurt as evans . the unhealthy , ugly atmosphere of rillington place is well illustrated in this film . it is a horrible , but true theatrical experience .		10		1
akira kurosawa , arguably the greatest japanese director of all time , introduced himself to western audiences in a big way with this brilliant , yet tantalizing story about a horrible murder that occurred in the woods and accounted by a woodcutter , a bandit , a woman , and a dead samurai . unfortunately , there is no real way to know what really happened since all the stories are different and impossible to piece together . therein , lies the meaning of kurosawa 's philosophy of this film . in life , there are many instances when to know the real , rock-solid truth is simply impossible . in this story , as kurosawa reveals in the multiple flashbacks of each character 's depiction of the event , we are led to believe that they are telling the truth since we can obviously see what is happening . however , kurosawa is challenging the concept of seeing an event occur that makes it true . in the society we live in , seeing is believing . kurosawa attempts to destroy that idea and paints a dismal picture of people doing bad things for all the wrong reasons , namely their own personal gain . for all these characters , to lie was to get ahead in some way or another . thus , it is hard to believe anyone and their version of it . as the priest does , we feel a great amount of animosity towards humans since it seems all they are in for is to survive on their own and not care about anyone else . as we try to unveil this mystery and discover the truth , kurosawa keeps our interest with some very nifty camera work that is world-famous today -lrb- camera pointing at sun , long shots in forest , etc. -rrb- if you have heard of anything about kurosawa , this is a great place to start studying him and his style . he is undoubtedly one of the finest directors of all time and the mind-bending rashomon is one of the best examples of film-making in the last century .		10		1
it 's back to the wizarding world with harry potter . the cast that brought the first movie to life are back , with an absolutely brilliant addition , jason isaacs as luscious malfoy , draco malfoy 's deliciously evil father . again , the script writers condense a full novel down to a 161 minutes in a way that , rather that leaving you feeling cheated by what was left out , you want to go back and read the book again . the breathtaking cinematography and instantly recognizable score take the viewer into the wizarding world where we find harry on his way through his second year at hogwarts . he and his two best friends , ron and hermione , thought they were going to have a quiet year at hogwarts . instead they end up trying to find out who opened the chamber of secrets and set a monster loose in the castle . along the way , we learn a little more about hogwarts and some of it 's past students , including tom riddle , a charming young man who is much more than he seems .		10		1
the original back to the future film was definitely the best in the series . it 's even on my top five list . back to the future is cute , funny , and an obvious classic . i know most of us have seen them , but i 'll say what it 's about . this is the first of three back to the future films . marty mcfly -lrb- the great michael j. fox -rrb- is a teen with boring parents , and a boring life and he has a girlfriend . his life is turned upside down when his friend dr. emmet brown -lrb- the great christopher lloyd -rrb- shows him a delorean . which is actually a time 's where the entire trilogy began and the films continued after that . i love every back to the future film . i like the original the most , then i like parts ii and iii equally . the back to the future films are nothing but fun and they 're great movies . this is definitely robert zemekis 's best film to date . he 's done other great films like romancing the stone , beowulf , and death becomes her . not one of the back to the future films has any weakness . back to the future is a film that should never be remade or anything . knowing the world today , if they did remake it , then they would cast shia lebeouf as marty . michael j. fox and christopher lloyd are irreplaceable . do n't remake it .		10		1

the first film by buñuel that i see was `` le charme discret de la bourgeoisie '' . i was a little confused , but then i was in loved of the . the film is excellent . then , i see `` l'age d'or '' , an excellent , probably , the best surrealistic experience of all times like `` un chien andalou '' . since i watch lars von trier 's `` dancer in the dark '' , i found that actress ... how is her name ... ah yes : catherine deneuve !!! not only she is beautiful , she is a great actress . one day , i found in a videostore `` belle de jour '' . i do n't know if this time this films with such rich artistic combination going to like me . all the opposite . `` belle de jour '' is a , and a must see . is an entertaining surrealistic drama with a sticky story and delightful characters . `` belle de jour '' told us the story of séverine , a beautiful but reserved who keeps the distances with his husband . sexually , she do n't want to know much . but ... well , she lately have been attracted for that topic , and decide to prove it in a brothel . she begins to discover the decadence in self . `` belle de jour '' is a must see because offers a touching story , with all the touch that only buñuel knows . the surprises are stupendous , catherine deneuve are unique -lrb- i think that is the best character of her -rrb- and the others are marvelous too -lrb- pierre clémenti is perfect for that mysterious boy named marcel -rrb- ... the fact is , that `` belle de jour '' , written by the same buñuel and carrière -lrb- who works too in `` la '' and `` le charme discret de la bourgeoisie '' , is , as rare , an excellent surrealistic masterpiece where you can think and feel what you want . the characters , specially of belle de jour and marcel , have a touch that make that we identify ourselves with them ... i mean ... there is no words to explain how wonderful is `` belle de jour '' . so get it and see it ... you going to be pleased . * sorry for the mistakes ... well , if there any .		10		1
i love this movie -lrb- the entire trilogy -rrb- , its right up there with indiana jones , lethal weapon , jurassic park , die hard and star wars ! it 's just another day here at hill valley in good il ' 1985 ... the local kids are aspiring to rock n ' roll stardom in vain , the local crackpot scientist is up to his neck in his self-inflicted hair-brained schemes , and the pecking order is still well and truly the same as it always has been since the birth of this town . however , nobody ever expected that future history was in the making when saturday october 26 rolled around ... 1:20 pm to be exact . marty mcfly is asked by close friend doc emmett brown to meet him at the local shopping precinct known as twin pines mall . marty then sees doc 's new custom-built version of an already rare vehicle called the `` delorean '' with a few special add-ons . before marty knows what 's about to hit him doc places his unsuspecting pet dog ` einstein ' into the delorean , hits the remote control and cranks the sucker up to 88mph whereby it unbelievably disappears right in front of them with only a pair of skimming past between their legs . the doc is impressed but marty is basically a nervous wreck when exactly a minute later the delorean explodes back to reality . the doc then reveals what he has achieved by this experiment , but an unpredictable event transpires whereby marty is catapulted back to 1955 . he soon discovers that his actions and interactions with everyone around him will have serious repercussions if things are not set back to what they once were . well , you have to see this movie and in my opinion its a must buy !		10		1
there are very few romantic comedies that make me feel as good , as this one does . i saw it for the first time when it first came out in the theater , back in 2004 , and today was the third time i 've seen it . though i 've seen it that many times , it never loses its charm or warmth , that i 've always seen in it . the thing about this movie , is that it 's very professionally presented on screen . you see the career life , just as much if not more , than the romance part of these two characters ' lives . dunst was perfectly chosen for this part , and although , off the top of my head , i do n't recall seeing paul bettany in any other films , i thought he did a terrific job playing his character , perhaps more so than dunst . the two really make you believe that they are tennis champions ... and the film delivers there stardom and romance in a way that not only do you feel like you 're apart of the relationship ... but it also has an amazing way of making you feel like the fans and the audience watching them from a distance . it 's brilliantly directed , perfectly casted , and excellently written . it 's funny , witty , light , cute , romantic and sweet . all the things that make up a terrific romance . and , this wo n't be the last time i see it , either . keep it in mind because i think you 'll be pleasantly surprised .		10		1
do n't fall in the easy trap of the parallel with the recent proposition against same-sex marriage . little to do . on one side a politician who knew what he was doing , on the other side amateurs who thought the battle could be won without real canvassing . do n't fall into another trap : the parallel with obama 's campaign on hope . those two dimensions exist but they can not be considered as the essential meaning of this film and certainly not the most important element about the story and the character , the real man behind this character . what is the main theme of this film ? though it speaks mostly of homosexuality , it is not about homosexuality , or at least not only . it concerns us all : it is about the freedom of each individual in our world to believe in , think as true and practice the life styles they want , the religions they want , the cultural , political , social , philosophical and all other imaginable orientations they want . this is written on the statue of liberty and at the very beginning of the declaration of independence , and , though the film does not say , in the first amendment to the constitution . this is universal and this concerns some countries like france for example where some beliefs are supposed not to be expressed publicly in institutions like schools or public administrations by students or personnel . that universal freedom is one of the most denied freedoms in the world . even today in advanced developed countries various orientations , and always in the name of privacy or private life which makes it an obligation for minorities to hide or be victimized , be they sexual or religious , or whatever . we can trust the human species to be always and on unforeseen and unforeseeable subjects . the human species is fundamentally and equality is a constant and never irreversible battle . the second important element has to do with political activism . a political campaign can only be victorious if it does not concern a narrow group and its privileges . it has to concern a fundamental right that may then concern the vast majority of the people : if that right is denied to one person in the whole social order , then that right is endangered for everyone . the only way to convince the vast majority of the population that this is so is to come out and show everyone that they have lived with some of these people all their life , as neighbors , colleagues , schoolmates or whatever . a right can only be won if the people concerned get out of the closet , cupboard or cabinet in which they lock themselves and start canvassing , provided this right they 're going to canvass for is a right that everyone can claim or enjoy , not the privilege of the happy few , like retiring at 50 with a full pension . canvassing requires courage and dedication , because it has to convince people and not force them into doing this or not doing that . the last element is that in the american society there is a very much privileged minority , the police . the situation is a lot better today with guaranteed diversity , when it is guaranteed , but still the spirit of being over the law because of the uniform or the gun is still very present in their minds . the latest of such events in france was the release by a cop of a piece of evidence against some accused people before these people had had the opportunity to defend themselves in court . in this film , the ex-cop kills the mayor of san francisco and a city supervisor out of cold blood , after having broken into the city hall , and he only got five years of prison for manslaughter and not murder . that was practically an accident if we follow that line pr approach . but the film is very clear about the use of violence in politics : it creates a political backlash and even at times a social backdraft and not progress . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne , university versailles saint quentin en yvelines , cegid		10		1
this is probably welles ' most complete masterpiece since citizen kane . not that it 's better than ambersons or touch of evil , but there 's a wholeness , a freedom from interference , a focusing of vision that 's complete . it 's also a relief to be able -lrb- for once -rrb- to enjoy a welles performance from this period , rather than laughing with him at its crass silliness . akim tamiroff is -lrb- as ever -rrb- extraordinary , while anthony perkins captures the mixture of nervousness and arrogance central to welles ' k . the trial is also a textbook lesson in how to film a classic text . while cinema thrives on the second-rate , transcending and enriching banality , it tends to founder when it appropriates the great works , due in part to the incompatibility of forms , but mostly because of pointless reverence . why bother being completely faithful to , say , howard 's end , when we can read the book . surely the only reasons to film a classic are to a -rrb- make it adaptable to film form ; b -rrb- make it relevant to our age ; or c -rrb- make it relevant to the director 's sensibility . welles , on one level , is certainly faithful to kafka 's vision . we get a nightmare depiction of bureaucracy gone mad , of the increasing , unidentifiable totalitarianism of modern life , of the persecution of the individual , of the impossibility of rebellion and alternatives . the sense of labyrinth and nightmare , and a desolate world abandoned by god , is chillingly evoked in the film 's astonishing visual framework , the hallucinatory set-pieces , the disorientating comedy , the bewildering logic . the knowledge that k. 's workplace was filmed in a disused railway station only adds to the film 's complexity - this is a society cut off from other people , ideas , civilisations ; one where there is no coming or going , no escape . and yet welles subverts all this . by removing kafka 's ambiguity , he makes the work more ambiguous . unlike the book , welles draws attention to the fact that this is a nightmare . k. begins the film getting dressed , and ends it stripping , the reverse process of going to sleep -lrb- i.e. to move plausibly back from the dream world to reality , k. has to return to the state that led to dream , unclothed in bed -rrb- . the suggestion that his adventures are a dream draws attention to the film 's main theme - the dangers of solipsism . k. is a paranoid - because he sees the world only from his point of view , he feels that everyone is out to get him . his selfishness is subtly hinted at throughout the film , by his stated profession not to get involved with anything , to avoid problems , to avoid others ' problems , to keep himself to himself , and get on . of course , this means that no-one will help him , as he finds out throughout the film . and if everybody is indifferent to their neighbour , than no wonder people are burned in death camps . was n't that the excuse of ` ordinary ' germans after the war ? ` we knew nothing about it ' . that 's why well-fed k. with his privileged job , is greeted by a gaunt group of camp victims . welles has to the trial in the knowledge of the final solution . this is accomplished by parodying k. 's us vs. them outlook , k with a complex doubling pattern - private scenes bursting into mass activity ; austerity alternating with wellesian baroque ; a dynamic jazz score merging into albinoni 's tragic , apocalyptic , funereal adagio . both readings are n't exclusive : they play off each other . creating an appropriately kafkaesque spiral of terror , the climactic scene - a classic wellesian stand-off between k. and the advocate -lrb- seemingly on his side , but really a playful collaborator -rrb- , completes the dissolution of the individual . they are shown to be indistinguishable , mere shadows of men . i do not say that we fail to sympathise with k. - his light is harrowing , but though his closing laugh can be interpreted as an admission of the absurdity of the universe , it 's a world made in his image .		10		1
based on the short story by harry bates , `` farewell to the master '' , this is not your typical science-fiction movie . this is an arrival of master intellectual awareness , which has been deliberately made to seem that the threat of mass human self-destruction is far more imminent and more than probable if the human race continues on the path that it blindly chooses , and will be so ever harder to turn back from . as an adversary of the wanton and narrow thinking of the leaders of the world and its peoples ' , and with his duties , he is sent by other worlds , to place an ultimatum . if this ultimatum goes unheeded , planet earth will be destroyed . filmed around the era of the beginning of the nuclear age and the early stages of cold war paranoia , the day the earth stood still exploits these traits very well , jumping on the bandwagon of suburban middle-class american vales , and their misguided mistrust of anything that does not support , and conform to , the american dream and all that it represents . set in an affluent part of washington d.c. , we see the by-product of societies propaganda machine and its mindset that it has blindly come to except . you can have any colour you like , as long as it 's not red . with these mature and realistic outlines , the day the earth stood still progresses to make the viewer conscious of the fact that the all impending doom caused by the petty squabbling of politicians , and their lack of vision will not only harm their own planet but transcend this childish war like nature to the outer planets . even to the point of ignoring the messengers warnings , and then having to be shown a demonstration of the seriousness of this hermes type visitor , do we come to terms of his threat . we are being told to re-educate ourselves , to learn that to play a game of dangerous consequence will only lead to , ironically , our own destruction , not by any man made tool , but from a far greater power . as this is science-fiction , it was then , and is very much so now , a wonderful and historical piece of movie making , not a theme of space and travel , but a theme of morals and the peoples fundamental need to live in harmony , brought to us by the superior intelligence of another planets science and technology . with its boyish charm to woe the child in us all , stood still ... can adapt very easily to a wider audience than most other science-fiction movies have . this movie can be seen through many angles , the young boy , bobby , and his over excitement and inquisitive mind that asks the questions for us , his protective worldly mother , played by patricia neal . her greedy and shallow , short sighted fiancée and the slightly mistrusting , but nice i 'm sure , old landlady , as well as the paranoid sheep that congregates on every street corner , watching , listening , judging and waiting . there is enough character development here for most to relate to . the acting here is impeccable , the delivery is at a pace that is not in a rush to squash in too much too soon . stood still ... is not an action movie but a movie of the subconscious and its lack of understanding of the significance of our actions . stood still ... acts as its own errand boy , who wants you to digest the message and the messenger , for as is the power of his message that it can not be ignored as rhetoric , rhetoric that the populace has been brought up to know and know only . his message does bear true , as his demonstration will testify . bernard herrmann has an exceptionally gifted talent for combining both suspense and atmosphere , giving the viewer the feeling of transition between the world that is ours and the impending doom of the unknown world that has landed on our doorstep . with a history that started with him working on the background score to citizen kane , the beautiful classic the ghost and mrs. muir , then the `` alfred hitchcock presents '' theme tune from the 1950 's television series . also , journey to the centre of the earth , the fantastic 1963 movie jason and the argonauts , 1976 's taxi driver and twelve monkeys from 1995 . to also include countless other movies , as well as working on alfred hitchcock 's the trouble with harry , the man who knew too much and the wrong man , both from 1956 , vertigo and performing on the classic psycho . he was to win the one oscar , for , the devil and daniel webster , 1941 . bernard herrmann passed away on december 24th , 1975 , from a heart attack . the late robert wise died on the 14th september 2005 ; his legacy leaves us with movies as the curse of the cat people , the desert rats , with richard burton . then he worked with paul newman on somebody up there likes me , west side story , the sound of music , working with steve mcqueen in the sand pebbles , also having the honour of directing the first star trek movie , star trek : the motion picture . winning two oscars in his career , as well as countless other awards and nominations that the movie industry gives , he was most certainly an accomplished and respected movie maker indeed . what makes the day the earth stood still so remarkable is its ability to pass through time with a seamless perpetual consistency to not age with its counterparts that have stood still with their own stereotypes . the day the earth stood still is an individually singular movie , one of the most original concepts , that is still , sadly , very prominent today as the first time it was aired during 1951 . we should be watching the skies ; we should be waiting for our own hermes . we should be learning to pronounce the only words that could save us all from our own early extinction , `` klaatu barada nikto '' !		10		1
one of disney 's best known and loved films . about a baby elephant born in the tough world of the circus who is ridiculed and shut out because of his large ears . comforted by his mother until she attacks a trainer and is penned up in a wagon , dumbo eventually learns that he can fly and becomes a star . a great film that deals with discrimination , self esteem , the importance of family and friendship . features a great score which it won an oscar for and a nomination for song , the beautiful `` baby mine '' . the pink elephants scene is a classic . wonderfully done , arguably disney 's best on a scale of one to ten ... 10		10		1
it is great to see another classic movie from pixar . finding nemo is an outstanding film . it is well animated and colorful . the voices are well cast in their respective roles , especially albert brooks and ellen degeneres -lrb- who i have not been a fan of in the past -rrb- . in a summer which has seen dark , moody movies like the matrix reloaded , it is great to have fun at the movies		10		1
george bailey -lrb- jimmy stewart -rrb- thinks he has a dreadful life . he runs a loan association in the small town of bedford falls . the company is always on the verge of bankruptcy and is constantly fighting the evil mr. potter -lrb- lionel barrymore -rrb- . he is married to an adoring wife -lrb- donna reed -rrb- and has three children . one christmas eve he is on the verge of suicide until his guardian angel -lrb- henry travers -rrb- shows up to stop him . no other word for it -- it 's a classic ! hard to believe this was a bomb when it first came out ... it 's reputation did n't even start till the early 1980s with repeated television showings . basically , there 's nothing wrong with the film . the script is well-written with realistic well-drawn characters . what really makes it work is that the movie does n't make stewart a goody two shoes -- he 's really unhappy and mean in the first section of the film . it makes his `` transformation '' at the end more believable and realistic . also it 's one of the few movies that has an ending that will have the entire audience crying -- out of happiness . the acting is just great all across the board , the set design incredible -lrb- bedford falls was on a sound stage ! -rrb- and is heart warming without getting too sentimental . i usually hate films like this but i 've loved this since the first time i saw it and make it a point to see it every christmas . a true classic . highly recommended .		10		1
the western to end all . a film about american mythology , to which end henry fonda is central as a sadistic hitman . this role pretty much undoes his whole career of do-gooding -lrb- with the exception of `` fort apache '' , which , it has been noted before , shows signs of influence on `` once upon a time ... '' -rrb- , but more so it also undoes a `` mythological '' complex in american film . the film 's shallowness is in its inability to produce any artistic or philosophic alternative to the myth . its attempt to do this is claudia cardinale as `` earth mother '' / water bearer . her character , the protagonist , is interesting and there are many parallels to joan crawford in `` johnny guitar '' -lrb- redeemed prostitute , the `` dream '' of a rail station , etc. -rrb- . the images are blazing with truth , and the characters are fantastic . we even get to see woody strode and jack elam in a memorable opening scene involving a fly -lrb- possibly a touch characteristic of contributing author dario argento ? -rrb- . bronson is very good in the role of the `` man with no name '' or `` man with the harmonica '' or whatever you want to call him . the music is some of morricone 's best . this is a western film that is about westerns , about the west , about america , about europe , about art and death . it impresses me that fonda 's character is not truly evil : he 's actually a petty , unsuccessful hitman , out to grab a piece of the west , and doomed to fail . this makes him no less frightening , for he is a dangerous man . but it does strike a blow at the whole image of the `` villain '' in the west which , if this film had been seen by more people , might have undone the whole genre -lrb- much as his previous `` fistful of dollars '' undid the hero in the genre -rrb- .		10		1
it is amazing to see such quality of actors all in one film . marlon brando , robert duvall , james caan , al pacino , and john cazale fill out one of the more impressive casts seen in modern movie making . you can just feel the intensity of the whole chain of events that happen .		10		1
batman begins ... where do i begin ? i 've seen it at least 6 or 7 times , and it never gets old . the direction behind this action gem from christopher nolan is excellent and bold . the darkness of the caped crusader is brilliantly captured by the great director behind memento . the way each scene interlocks with the others is another mark of this film . starring christian bale , oscar winner michael caine , katie holmes , oscar winner morgan freeman , oscar nominee gary oldman , oscar nominee tom wilkinson , golden globe nominee cillian murphy , oscar nominee liam neeson , rutger hauer , and ken watanabe , batman begins redefines the action/drama genre . bruce wayne -lrb- bale -rrb- watched his parents die at an early age , forcing himself to believe that he was responsible for their deaths . he then flees gotham to the himalayan mountains . while recounting his inner thoughts to henri ducard -lrb- neeson -rrb- , bruce further delves into his past , by also remembering the day that his parents ' killer was released from prison because he could provide information about notorious gangster carmine falcone -lrb- wilkinson -rrb- . after being nearly forced to do something he does n't believe in , bruce flees his new home in the himalayan mountains and his mentor , ducard , and his leader , ra 's al ghul -lrb- watanabe -rrb- . with the help of his butler , alfred -lrb- caine -rrb- , a military arms specialist inside of his father 's company named lucius fox -lrb- freeman -rrb- , a lieutenant of gotham police named jim gordon -lrb- oldman -rrb- and his former childhood friend , assistant district attorney rachel dawes -lrb- holmes -rrb- , bruce becomes batman , determined to take down carmine falcone and his ally , dr. jonathan crane aka the scarecrow -lrb- murphy -rrb- , not to mention a mysterious third person , as they devise a scheme to take over gotham . what stands out the most about this film to the average viewer will be the performances . besides the great direction and writing , the performances of christian bale , liam neeson , cillian murphy , and michael caine stand out the most in this . it 's hard to go into further examination of neeson without spoiling the plot details , so i 'll focus on the other three . christian bale as batman is not only the right choice , it is the best choice . bale commands the screen as batman in every scene , but he still keeps the character human . his voice is near perfect for both bruce and batman . this is the best performance of any comic book character from any movie . next up is one of the villains , cillian murphy as the scarecrow . parents beware : the scarecrow is the scariest of any of the villains of the batman movies . murphy will frighten anyone under age 12 . murphy plays the part of crane very well , making him mentally strong , but reminding the audience that he is just a simple skinny doctor -lrb- who just so happens to have a hallucinogen working for him -rrb- . murphy also commands the screen in all scenes he 's in , and says some of the coolest lines in the movie . michael caine is very good as batman 's right hand man , alfred pennyworth . caine gives the audience a feeling of warmth every time he appears , not to mention reassurance . batman begins one of five films that are must see 2005 . they are ` crash ' , ` harry potter and the goblet of fire ' , ` star wars episode iii : revenge of the sith ' , ` batman begins ' , and ` walk the line ' . batman begins has it all ... great performances , exceptional direction , amazing special effects , cool fight scenes , nice one-liners , and great writing . i recommend it to everyone .		10		1
this is the ultimate `` us vs them '' epic . how can you hate it ? it has great special effects , great music , plenty of humor , and characters who are more sympathetic than most . it 's meant to be fun people . and it 's a hell of a lot more fun than those crappy star wars prequels . as usual , jeff goldblum is the scene stealer as a quirky genius , and will smith does his usual tough , smart , funny persona bit . bill pullman is alright as the president ; his wife is played by the lady from `` dances with wolves '' . judd hirsch is fun as jeff 's dad . sure there are problems with the plot - the fact that this all happens in the pan of 3 days is ridiculous . maybe there are too many characters and maybe the film is long , but this is n't a terrible crime . the film is n't bad . the destruction of the cities are well done and the climax is rousing in the tradition of the classic star wars trilogy . if you want a really bad science fiction film , go watch the above mentioned star wars prequels , `` phantom menace '' and `` attack of the clones '' .		10		1
i know this movie was n't regarded as much to the general public , but the sense of humor do n't lie . and this movie made me laugh more than any other film i 've seen -- other than albert brooks ' `` the muse . '' after writing my brilliantly rave review for this film , people were suggesting i check out woody 's `` far more superior '' flicks like `` annie hall '' and `` crimes and misdemeanors . '' before this movie , the only woody allen flicks i 've seen were `` deconstructing harry '' -- which i thought was uneven and none too appealing -- and `` mighty aphrodite '' -- a very impressive and funny film . after watching this hilarious comedy , i became greatly interested in checking out woody 's earlier work -- his much earlier work . after watching films like `` annie hall '' and `` take the money and run '' i still say this is his funniest film up to date ! the plot is simple and never wears thin . this could 've went straight to one-joke boredom , but it had something new to offer in every act . the whole bank robbery attempt was only the first act . the second act deals with some hilarious fish-out-of-water , rags-to-riches comedy after the two low-class new yorkers -- woody and tracey ullman who is absolutely terrific and was robbed of an oscar -- `` move on up '' -- but not to the east side ... lol . watching woody trying disastrously to adapt to the yuppy lifestyle is one of the funniest things i 've ever seen on film . in one scene , he 's being interviewed and he 's trying to describe an antique piece of furniture to the reporter : `` this belonged to louie the fourteenth -- or louie the fifteenth . i do n't know , how high do the go ? he 's the top louie . '' woody and ullman have an unbelievable chemistry as the dueling couple . i hope to see them again in an upcoming movie , they are absolutely incredible . some people do n't understand woody 's brand of humor , but his style of delivering sarcastic dialogue in this movie makes me crack up so hard ! in the opening scene , he returns to his apartment and ullman asks `` who 's there ? '' he replies , `` who -- who is it ? it 's the pope ! i always wanted to see what your house looked like ! '' if any other actor were to say those lines , i would not laugh , but woody has this magic delivery that never ceases to please . there 's many other hints of woody 's sarcasm used frequently throughout the film . this comedy is full of memorable moments that i can just think back to and a smile will stretch across my face . it would be sin to give those jokes away to those who have yet to see this movie , so i will not get into them . just see for yourself ! with the explosion of gross-out comedies , i guess you can say a movie like this is a blessing in disguise . there 's no cheap , low-brow shots here . nothing but good , intelligent , original , old-fashioned , sarcastic comedy that pokes fun at both the upper and lower class , in a way only woody can pull it off . there 's also some noteworthy supporting performers . i have to mention elaine may , who plays the airhead character with pure excellence . i admit that i 've grown tired of the airhead characters i see in comedies -- especially the dumb blondes -- but she portrays the characters with a certain sense of wit and energy , and has some really funny lines . what more can i say about this movie ? it 's a comedy that 's both amiable and funny , none of the cynical humor people have grown accustomed to . this would 've been a normal comedy back in the 1950s , but now if you make a film that does n't contain a single flatulence or sexual gag -- that 's like breaking the comic barrier . not jumping on the bandwagon with the rest of the comedy writers . while the farrelly brothers are whisked away on this wagon , woody stands on his own and makes this uproariously funny , original comedy ! a film i will always remember as an underrated classic ! this is what comedy is all about ! my score : 10 -lrb- out of 10 -rrb-		10		1
first off i have to say that i was not a fan of mma before seeing this film . what drew me to it was the belief that it was more than just a sports film , that at the heart of the film was the relationship between the two brothers tommy , -lrb- tom hardy -rrb- and brendan -lrb- joel edgerton -rrb- . that belief was completely correct , this film manages to tell a wonderfully sad and ultimately redemptive story while at the same time being very respectful to the sport of mma fighting . the story of course centers around the two brothers , who are very much estranged from each other and their father , paddy -lrb- nick nolte -rrb- . all three characters have issues but the most damaged is war vet , tommy , who is played beautifully by tom hardy . nick nolte is also amazing in this as a former alcoholic who is now several years sober and trying to repair his relationship with his two sons . although i gave lots of praise to hardy and nolte , i in no way mean to leave out edgerton 's performance , as i had really little interest in his character , a former ufc fighter turned high school physics teacher trying and failing to make ends meet for his family , to begin with but i thoroughly enjoyed watching his part of the story unfold as well . i wont go in depth into the story but the basic plot is that both brothers make their way into sparta , an mma fighting event put on to pit the best mma fighters against each other until only one is left standing to claim the 5 million dollar prize , with the first part of the film focusing on setting up their personal lives and relationships with each other and their training for the sparta competition . the second part of the film features the brothers fights with other competitors , which are very cool by the way , and leads into the conclusion of the film which i wo n't give away . in all honesty i was expecting this film to be good but it completely blew me away with how great it turned out to be . it has incredible heart and lots of action and fighting , so for me it was the total package . it is about family first and fighting second but the fighting is handled extremely well and is essential to the story and plot . if you like bonus features as i do this blu-ray has a lot of extras to offer including a deleted scene , gag reel , and a couple different short documentary 's on the research that director gavin o ' connor and the rest of the crew put into the film in order to make the fighting realistic and credible . so , in short the story was great , the characters are complex and easy to connect with , and the fighting is exciting and realistic . i loved this movie and i ca n't recommend it enough to people , even people like myself who are not into `` sports '' movies , and by sports movies i mean a film that focuses mostly on the sport and the game being played not so much the character development or a bigger , overall plot . and there is nothing wrong with those films , what i am saying is that i believe this can be enjoyed by an even bigger audience . the mma element while essential to the film should not scare anyone away from watching this great film . this gets a very well deserved 5 stars from me because it was awesome and i ca n't wait to watch this film over and over again . it 's simply that great .		10		1
at first , i wondered why they were releasing this `` adaptation '' so quickly after the ang lee version . i had n't recovered from that disappointment and did n't have much confidence the new movie would get it right , either . it was specially daunting , coming right behind `` ironman '' , but there some intriguing variables , most importantly , the fact that edward norton was playing our doomed scientist . finally , i must admit that the new `` hulk '' is everything a film of this genre should be : exciting , interesting , very nice to look , showing a range of emotions , and most importantly , it leaves you hoping there is a sequel really soon ! the excitement never lets up in this one . from the introduction of the `` hulk '' when the original experiment goes awry . later on , other pieces come together , and we understand how each of the participants contributed to the tragic transformation of our hero . it is the trademark of a good screenwriter than he is able to create multidimensional characters , without relying too much on narration or extended dialog pieces . most of the information is delivered visually , through montages , and a couple of lines placed at the right moment in key scenes to recall past events . some of the film is even told in a foreign language , and it does n't seem to matter because it completes that particular chapter and adds truth to the scene . in addition to being exciting , the film is a pleasure to watch , as we follow our hero through his odyssey from brazil to guatemala and back to the states . great camera work adds plenty of mood to each scene . the director and cinematographer have seamless added special effects to a beautifully shot movie . gone were my reservations about the look of the `` monster '' in the first film . this time , the new hulk is able to project his emotions without calling much attention to the fx . the hulk is actually capable of showing a range of emotions ranging from desperation to anger , and it touches us . it is also refreshing to see a love story in the middle of this action fantasy film . it gives every character a much need dimension that is usually missing from this type of adventures . the lovely liv tyler has amazing chemistry with norton and fully supports the main character as he moves through his adventures . and let 's not forget that final scene ... if i was craving a sequel from its opening scene , i could n't restrain myself from gasping when i saw the guest star who shows up at the last minute to exchange a few words with the william hurt character . i 'm dying to see what happens next .		10		1
my take : considered the best of the star trek movies , and for most of its parts , it 's hard to argue with that . i was simply blown away by j.j. abrams ' new star trek reboot that my inner admiration for the big screen star trek series is somehow reawakened . i 'm not exactly a an avid fan of gene roddenberry 's 43 year-old franchise , which began as a tv series and proceeded into a movie series and continued with more tv shows . but to be honest , i have grown a sort of affection for the big-screen series , which i find interesting and enduring as stand-alone films . but after seeing the new reboot -lrb- and loving it -rrb- , i guess it 's time to pay a visit to those classic original crew movies . and what better place to start than one of the best in the series : star trek ii : the wrath of khan ? while i loved the new star trek for the typical summer-movie dosage of action , humor and thrills , i also liked how it had time to introduce -lrb- or is that reintroduce ? -rrb- the characters and work on some intriguing plot lines . star trek : the wrath of khan may not be big on spectacular explosions and more elaborate space battles , but its an absolutely rousing space opera with an interesting plot , some intriguing ideas and strong character development . star trek was n't really about space dogfights and death stars , and i guess it 's probably for the best . the last thing people expect back then was another sci-fi sensation trying to be as big as star wars was . instead , wrath of khan geared itself with much more interesting ideas , including a far more intriguing villain . ricardo montalban 's performance as khan , probably the most popular villain ever in the star trek universe -lrb- though there would n't much of a competition -rrb- , is truly unforgettable , especially with much deeper motives . he has ceased control of a federation starship and has also stolen the genesis missile , possibly one of the most lethal doomsday device in the universe -lrb- ironically , it was supposed to be used as means to create life on a barren planet ! -rrb- , and yet , his real motive is vengeance . vengeance has poisoned his mind , and has driven him completely mad . guess they just do n't make villains this good anymore ! captain -lrb- now admiral -rrb- kirk -lrb- william shatner -rrb- has his own issues . he was captain of the uss enterprise for many a year and age has surely caught up with him . being admiral puts those gung-ho days behind him , but he still longs to boldly go where no one has gone before . ca n't science fiction movies be this thoughtful with their characters ? add to that , there 's the familiarity and camaraderie between the popular crew that i have grown to love about these movies . they may just beat star wars when it comes with the power of the team ! but perhaps one of the best things about wrath of khan is that , despite a few minor details , is a purely stand-alone movie . sure one of its prime directives is to reunite its fans after the alienation the much-maligned star trek : the motion picture did . but whether or not you know who khan or anyone else is , wrath of khan is not grounded in its fanbase . there 's about something for everyone here , just as long as you know what to expect . anyone expecting a special effects overdrive are missing the point . since star trek was more of a thinking person sci-fi movie , wrath of khan is more space opera than it is a sci-fi action movie . still , there are some dazzling special effects and thrills here and there . the space battles are not exactly on par with star wars ' , but they 're just as enjoyable thanks to some well-crafted special effects and a rousing score by james horner . the performances are n't exactly oscar-worthy , but this familiar cast portraying these familiar characters ? could it be done any other way ? i think not ! overall , star trek : wrath of khan is still one of the best , if not the very best to everyone else , in the successful big-screen series . still a must-see ! rating : ***** out of 5 .		10		1
when you read such good things about a movie , you are ready for some kind of disappointment ... oh , not such a thing with this one . in fact i think is the best movie i 've seen in years . this movie is simply amazing : original directing with a classical crime story . the actors , especially the fabulous ricardo , are pitch-perfect . he is an surprise an revelation . this movie reminds me of why i still go see movies : because sometimes , without expectations , a movie blows you away and makes you believe in magic . i really think this movie deserve 's every accolade and the oscar it has won and easily is the best movie of the year !		10		1
for his feature-film debut , françois truffaut drew inspiration from his own troubled childhood . the 400 blows stars jean-pierre léaud as antoine doinel , truffaut 's preteen alter ego . one of the defining films of the french new wave , it displays many of the characteristic traits of the movement . written by truffaut and marcel moussy , it is about a misunderstood adolescent in paris who is thought by his parents and teachers to be a troublemaker . misunderstood at home by his parents and tormented in school by his insensitive teacher , antoine frequently runs away from both places . the boy finally quits school after being accused of plagiarism by his teacher . he steals a typewriter from his father to finance his plans to leave home . the father angrily turns antoine over to the police , who lock the boy up with hardened criminals . a psychiatrist at a delinquency center probes antoine 's unhappiness , which he reveals in a fragmented series of monologues . poignant , exhilarating , and fun , this film is an important classic . originally intended as a 20-minute short , it was expanded into a feature when truffaut decided to elaborate on his self-analysis . for the benefit of truffaut 's fellow film buffs , the 400 blows is full of brief references to favorite directors , notably truffaut 's jean vigo . the director 's ode to his childhood is an engrossing watch that is alluring in its simplicity and brilliant in its direction . it flows nicely at its own pace , never allowing melodrama to ruin its realistic and voyeuristic addition to that , it brought a fresh and piercingly honest portrayal of troubled youth to the screen . in many ways , antonie doinel is not only the cinematic embodiment of truffaut , but also the french new wave as a of that , it has become one of the all-time great coming-of-age movies .		10		1
tom hooper 's extraordinarily self-possessed crowd-pleaser conveys by way of true cinematic form the account of a man duty-bound to speak to the world with a speech impediment . it must be excruciating enough for one who stutters to address another individual . to handle a radio microphone and know the british empire is taking note must be a nightmare . at the time of the titular speech , a quarter of the world 's people was in the empire , and naturally they 'd be listening , including germany , with special interest . britain was going to war with germany . king george vi 's spectators needed resolve , precision and tenacity , not hesitant disrupted with angst-ridden silences . this was a man who never sought to be king . after the death of his father , the throne was to succeed to his brother edward . but edward relinquished the throne to marry the woman he loved , and the responsibility fell to prince albert , who had grappled with his voice since childhood . hooper begins this thoroughly pleasurable film with an aesthetically top-notch point-of-view sequence of albert , struggling to open the british empire exhibition in 1925 . before a packed stadium and a radio audience , he clutches in misery to make the words emerge correctly . his father , george v , has forever deemed `` bertie '' a cut above his brother , though the establishment of media , which entail a ruler to be seen and heard on broadcast events . the triumph of the film comes , as far as i 'm concerned , centrally from invariably being with and inside the king . sensitively , we devote a vast amount in the character , and that understanding is delicately pushed along by using remarkable visual compositions . wide lenses are used very close to the actors ' faces to exceedingly evoke their and our emotional response , camera movement and lighting makes it persuasive and keeps us betrothed to the fearful ruler . not only do i honor the audacious framing choices that visually share bertie 's discomforted struggle speaking , but there is also exquisite regeneration of the look of early color stocks . at that 1925 speech , we see bertie 's wife , elizabeth , her face beset with pity . as it grows apparent that edward 's fixation on wallis simpson is incorrigible , she realizes her bertie may meet more public disgrace . he sees numerous speech therapists , one of whom tries the old custom . nothing works , and then she finds an unsuccessful australian actor named lionel logue , who has set up a speech therapy practice . logue does n't realize initially who is referring to him . and one of the focuses of the film is logue 's way of behaving toward crowned heads . he proposes to albert that they speak in unceremonious terms . albert has been reared within the majestic vacuum of the monarchy and take offense at such conduct , not because he has an eminent view of himself but because , well , it just is n't proper . but logue understands that if he is to become the king 's counselor , he must first become his acquaintance . this handsomely produced film is abounding in period nuances and fastidious class differences . director tom hooper makes fascinating choices with his locations and visuals . the movie is mainly shot in interiors , and most of those spaces are an impressively rendered composition overlapping the constricted with the expansive . that 's extraordinary in historical dramas , which highlight scope and splendor and that . here we have elongated passageways , a bottomless and tapered master control room for the bbc , rooms that appear markedly geometric . the film mainly interests the actors colin firth , reserved and polite , and geoffrey rush , generous and outgoing , in psychosomatic labor . helena bonham carter , who can be hardhearted , is here alive with benevolence , discretion and affection for her husband . this is the woman who became the beloved queen mother of our time , living to a hundred . as the men have a scuffle of self-control and spirit , she attempts to iron the situation . and in the broader realm , hitler finds supremacy , war nears , mrs. simpson devastates , and the feared day looms when bertie , as george vi , will have to address the world and wage war . hooper 's handling of that loaded scene is virtuosic . firth interjects his anxiety and keeps the obligatory , virtually fortitude in the face of adversity , while his personnel and family are frightened on his behalf as he strides toward a microphone as if were a gas chamber . it 's the one scene in the film that must come off , and it does , and its poignant effect is astoundingly deep . finally , what we have here is a first-class historical drama and a commanding intimate one . and two contraries who stay confidantes for the remainder of their lives . the r rating concerns logue 's use of expletives . it 's absolutely incomprehensible . this is an outstanding film for children and teenagers whose parents will blindly follow that they should forbid their kids from seeing it and let them see red and the twilight saga instead . while i 'm raving , i might as well add that i think it terribly sad to find criticism of danny cohen 's cinematography on message boards on grounds that it does n't follow basic rules of composition . it 's not common to find a film that merges all aspects of the world it creates into such a seamlessly layered multi-faceted visual experience . quite close to every film we see is either shot in for epic scope and majesty or from the small-scale voyeuristic perspective , and even on the rare occasion that a film does both , it 's at any given moment doing either one or the other . by that token , one might go as far as to say that most films fail to capture half of the story they depict ! that is , by the standards set by this transcendent picture .		10		1
i thought this was a good rehash of an old classic . i like the fact they used the original two from the first disney movie -lrb- escape to witch mountain -rrb- with kim richards and ike eisenmann . kim playing the waitress and ike playing the sheriff . and in the middle is dwayne johnson . who plays jack bruno , a hard and gritty taxi driver who wants nothing more than to do his shift and go home . yet in this case here comes two unsuspecting teens , who are visitors from another world . their mission is to save their planet , using certain fragments of dna which have been collected on earth in order for their home planet to thrive once more . once the two get back that is . but there is always an obstacle , like an assassin built by their military to kill both seth and sara and start a colonization plan . and to add more difficulties , a rather maniac government agent wants both to be captured and eviscerated . with all sides closing in , jack remembers a fare about a woman who is a debunked physicist and goes to her for help . with all parties chasing them its a time line now of how to get their ship back from the government , evade an assassin , get themselves back home and save their world . and with jack , his feelings to the kids had become even more special . he would protect them at all costs , to keep them from harm and to make sure they can get home . in the end he was also given a special gift from sara , the ability to communicate with the mind . i thought this was a very good film . it brought back a lot of memories of when i was a kid watching tia and tony . and of course the hard gritty eddie albert . good rendition .		10		1
my 10/10 rating is of course because `` reefer madness '' is so bad that it 's good . and boy is it ! meant as an propaganda film , the whole thing basically makes marijuana look fun . the plot has some wholesome teenagers getting duped into smoking marijuana and turning into lunatics -lrb- thereby idiotically implying `` one puff and you 're hooked ! '' -rrb- . the first mistake that the movie makes is calling marijuana a narcotic ; anyone should know that marijuana is a weed . obviously , the law-and-order types have always used this type of propaganda to arrest anyone whom they do n't like . but anyway , `` reefer madness '' is unintentionally hilarious . `` that '70s show '' once did a spoof of it , portraying red imagining eric getting addicted . for the record , there 's no such thing as marijuana addiction ; people just like smoking it . and who would n't want to try some after watching this movie ?!		10		1

` the world 's end ' : five stars -lrb- out of five -rrb- the third film in writer/director edgar wright 's ` three flavours cornetto ' trilogy -lrb- following 2004 's zombie comedy ` shaun of the dead ' and 2007 's buddy cop film spoof , and homage , ` hot fuzz ' -rrb- . wright co-wrote the film -lrb- once again -rrb- with actor simon pegg , who also stars in the movie with nick frost -lrb- once again -rrb- . martin freeman , paddy considine , eddie marsan and rosamund pike co-star in the film which is about five friends attempting to complete a pub crawl -lrb- they were n't able to 20 years earlier -rrb- when they discover their old town is overrun by aliens . the film is another great triumph for wright and pegg and a fitting conclusion to their ` trilogy ' . pegg plays gary king in the film , an alcoholic who ca n't get over the glory days of his past . while telling stories of his youth , in rehab , he tells of a time -lrb- 20 years earlier -rrb- when he and his four best friends attempted to complete an infamous pub crawl called the golden mile . in gary 's mind this was the greatest time of his life . so he decides to get the gang back together and try another crack at it . his friends reluctantly agree despite sour memories they all have for gary ; especially andy -lrb- frost -rrb- , who gary abandoned during a drunk escapade , and steven -lrb- considine -rrb- , due to gary sleeping with the woman he loved , sam chamberlain -lrb- pike -rrb- , 20 years earlier . sam is also the sister of their friend oliver -lrb- freeman -rrb- . each has their own issues as another friend , peter -lrb- marsan -rrb- , runs into a bully from his past on the crawl . things get really out of control when they realize their hometown , newton haven , is now controlled by aliens and many residents have been replaced by robots . ` the world 's end ' is a movie that actually celebrates drinking obsessively and taking pride in it ! i liked it better before it suddenly transitioned into a sci-fi flick . i was so involved in the characters and what was going on with them that i almost forgot that it was an alien invasion movie as well . it would n't be an edgar wright flick if it did n't have a sci-fi , action or horror element though . the thing he 's always best at is character development and human drama -lrb- and comedy -rrb- though . i cried multiple times in ` shaun of the dead ' -lrb- which is my favorite film of his -rrb- . i do n't think this new film is quite as good as his other three but it 's still a great movie . it 's not quite as moving but it is hilarious and still has plenty of human drama as well . the invasion storyline is also the weakest genre twist of any of his movies but it works . it also has stunts coordinated by brad allen , who 's mostly just worked with jackie chan -lrb- prior to this film -rrb- , and the bar room fight scenes were heavily influence by chan 's films , like ` the drunken master ' , they 're spectacular . the characters -lrb- like with all of wright 's films -rrb- are really what the movie is all about and that 's why it 's a great film . pegg is fantastic in the lead and he always has a great way of playing a completely different character from one edgar wright film to the next . in this film he 's an arrogant and crude ass but he 's still lovable -lrb- at least a little -rrb- and relatable . another masterpiece ! watch our movie review show ` movie talk ' at :		10		1
dr. strangelove is widely considered to be one of stanley kubrick 's best films , if not the best , and it 's easy to see why . i remember watching it several years ago and not really getting into it , but as i rewatched it a couple nights ago i realized quickly what i had missed back then . it is a remarkably simple film , an actor 's film , obviously , but the crackling dialogue and the stunning performances -lrb- most notably from peter sellers and george c. scott , of course -rrb- , are what really make the movie work so well . that is , of course , a pretty powerful statement , to give so much credit to the actors , since the story itself is a compellingly realistic and plausible what-if tale that was released to the public in an atmosphere of frightening tension between the u.s. and russia . so realistic , in fact , that they felt it necessary to including a disclaimer at the beginning of the film , in which the air force would like to assure the public that it has systems in place which would prevent such a thing from ever happening . the film begins with something that was news to me , that america kept a given number of b-52 bombers airborne 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , in the event that their destructive services might be suddenly needed , which itself is a sign of what the times were like back then . the story concerns a general who loses his mind and orders all airborne bombers to attack russia , unprovoked . the men on board the planes are dumbstruck , of course , because they realize the meaning of this order . a brilliant slim pickens is in charge on board one of the planes , and there is a rumor that during the performance , he was n't told that the film was a comedy , which may be one of the reasons his comic performance is so brilliant , because this is exactly the kind of comedy that kubrick loves and excels with . as roger ebert once noted , a man wearing a funny hat is not funny . but a man who does n't know he 's wearing a funny hat ... i have three favorite interactions in the film . the first is the isolated interaction between the crazy general and one of sellers ' performances , colonel mandrake , who is stuck with the general and forced to listen with increasing agitation and disbelief to the general 's explanations for why it is so imperative to strike the russians immediately -lrb- `` a foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual ! '' -rrb- . this is funny to me because i have a close friend who 's wife is absolutely convinced that the american government is doing this to its own citizens right now as i write this , in early 2008 . she should watch this film . the second performance i love is sellers ' portrayal of dr. strangelove , although i 'll admit that i remain a little confused as to why the film ended with his sudden exclamation that he can walk . i know there is something going on there that i 'm missing but i just ca n't think of it . and last but not least , george c. scott as the fanatical general buck turgidson . scott 's performance is so brilliant and in such deep detail that it 's impossible to see it all in one viewing . i rewound all of his scenes two or three times and there is always something new . i think his might be the best performance in the movie . watch , of course , for a young james earl jones on board the airplane , and of course pickens ' exit from the airplane and the movie , which is one of the most famous moments in film history . and of course , since in china i especially appreciated this - listen for mandrake 's hilarious comment about his experience being tortured by the japanese ! only peter sellers could make something as real and disturbing as japanese torture this funny !		10		1
* spoilers from hell * london , 1888 . frederick abberline -lrb- johnny depp -rrb- is a scotland yard cop with terrible losses -lrb- pregnant wife -rrb- in the past , an addiction to opium in the present and a prodigious gift of precognition , who is assigned , along with his colleague -lrb- robbie coltrane -rrb- to investigate the case of a serial killer of prostitutes ... who calls himself jack the ripper . as he digs deeper and deeper into the case , he meets mary kelly -lrb- heather graham -rrb- whose friends are dropping like flies under the ripper 's knife , and ends up falling in love with her . but the ripper is closing in on her ... who is he , and why is he doing this ? there are some signs that point to the queen and/or someone close to her being involved in the murders ... the hughes brothers have managed to make a gripping movie -lrb- i have n't read the source material - a graphic novel - so i ca n't vouch for a perfect adaptation -rrb- , not static and interested in long , scenes , but fast paced , intriguing and , especially true to how the whitechapel murder scenes really were -lrb- they recreated whitechapel in hungary - or was it romania ? - to be as accurate as possible -rrb- . and depp , as usual , soars above his very good colleagues , making his abberline as human as he can be , a man of words and action at the same time . from hell : 10/10 .		10		1
this film is absolutely and utterly hilarious . it must have the highest ratio of gags per minute in movie history , and hardly a single one falls flat . the casting and performances are perfect . i 've always said that the majority of the best comedy comes when it is played straight . i wo n't waste time quoting and calling your attention to certain jokes because they are far funnier onscreen than the written word can convey . watch the movie , it 's more fun than poring over dialogue ... best character : johnny -lrb- crazy control tower dude -rrb- leslie nielsen : this and the `` naked gun 's '' 1 & 2 were when you used to make funny movies . study and learn .		10		1
usually , i never would have imagined franco 's spain as the setting for a fantasy , but `` el laberinto del 's labyrinth '' does a great job with it . i really liked the contrast between the real events and ofelia 's -lrb- ivana vaquero -rrb- chimera world containing some strange - seemingly brutal - characters , and the real world containing the authentic brutality of capt. vidal -lrb- sergi lopez -rrb- . as mystifying as it as disturbing , this movie gives one a sense of what it was like to live then . no doubt the near phantasmagoria of the girl 's imaginary world is nothing compared to the torture that capt. vidal inflicts on prisoners . overall , this is one that i really recommend . guillermo del toro -lrb- of `` cronos '' and `` mimic '' fame -rrb- scored another good one here . i ca n't do justice to it by trying to describe it ; you have to see it . it certainly deserved its oscar win .		10		1
an astounding feat by director george roy hill and screenwriter steve tesich , who manage to condense john irving 's masterpiece into a cohesive film and not lose anything in the process . robin williams has the title role and he does some of his best acting here . he convincingly portrays garp from high school to middle-age with ease . hill keeps the film from becoming merely episodic and ties things together in the most believable ways . the film is powerful , funny , suspenseful and extremely well acted by not only williams , but by glenn close -lrb- perfect as his unusually liberated mother -rrb- , john lithgow , and marybeth hurt as garp 's strong-willed yet infinitely patient wife . the outstanding cinematography is by miroslav -lrb- it helps that the film was shot in such places as nyc , fishers island and ny -rrb- . the large cast also includes warren berlinger , peter michael goetz , swoozie kurtz -lrb- hysterical as a befuddled yet very helpful hooker -rrb- , hume cronyn & jessica tandy as close 's parents , jenny wright , brenda as , and the inimitable amanda plummer as ellen james . a great movie .		10		1
directed by david lean 1955 's summertime is one of his less epic films and in my opinion very underrated . despite having a sweet romantic story at it 's heart , the main focus of summertime is without a doubt it 's breathtaking photography in and around imagine on it 's release -lrb- as with me now -rrb- it had people wishing that they could go and visit american spinster jane hudson -lrb- katherine hepburn -rrb- is on holiday in italy , not just to see the country but to find something she 's been missing all these it 's love or finding herself and getting away from it all is never really made clear , i think it 's a mix of the first two . she does n't want to be a typical in and out tourist just spending a day in she checks into a little hotel on one of the canals and sets about seeking out everything hidden in the corners of the city . one afternoon at an outdoor cafe she meets handsome shop owner renato de rossi -lrb- rossano brazzi -rrb- . he is amused and intrigued by her and after a few more encounters the two fall in love , but can they have a happy ever after ending ? . well watch this gorgeous hidden gem and discover a tale of adventure , culture clashes , disappointment and love one of david leans best , it reminds me a bit of the passionate friends and like that is shockingly overlooked .		10		1
the film is not only dealing with robin hood , the famous and mysterious character of english history and the forest of sherwood . it is a lot more , a film on the tricky period when richard lionheart coming back from his crusade is killed in a battle in france . this time when john lackland is taking over and has to face the attempt to invade england performed by the french king philip ii augustus . the invasion was prepared by a treacherous friend of king john who tried to use his friendship to serve the interests of the french king . he submitted the northern part of the country to heavy taxes and a lot of violence that caused their rebellion against the king , which should have enabled the french fleet to disembark and conquer london . the film is essentially an adventure film but it is also based on history and it respects that history . the way the king manipulates the rebellious barons to get their help in time to defeat the french on his own beaches is the perfect case of a liar that uses the belief in divine kings of the time only to seize more power and deprive others from any small piece of it . we know it will take fifteen to sixteen years for an alliance to be built between the barons , the church and the merchants of the city of london to force that king john to come to and accept to sign the magna carta that will change the world , that represents the first step of that vast historical change that we call democracy . fifteen small years in the heart of feudalism to achieve that phenomenal transformation . and that magna carta is so small when measured with our own values that we are amazed by the infinitely small in history . robin hood , who is not yet robin hood , since the film ends when robin longstride is outlawed by john lackland , is thus only one small man among these men , and women , who made history then , or started to make history , though it seems fairer to say that they were those who finally brought england in the wake of the slowly moving boat of history . this action film only becomes that historical film i am speaking of if you know all these details of english history . otherwise it will remain an action film . ridley scott just did a good film in both directions . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne , university paris 8 saint denis , university paris 12 créteil , cegid		10		1
like last year , pirates is the best movie of this summer as well . hands down , the swashbuckling jack sparrow , the suave hector barbossa the courageous elizabeth swann and the determined william turner . all of them together in one 3 hour epic . at world 's end is the one movie , which really brings out the truth about pirates as a whole . betrayals for their own needs . throughout the movie until the very end , almost everyone is ready to defy anything to match their own needs . every character throughout the whole trilogy has some say in this movie . apart from the aforementioned four , the sensational sao feng , the good minded jack norrington , the evil davey jones , the comic and pintel -lrb- there are many more , rest assured -rrb- . each and everyone meets out their ends . this last part of the trilogy starts off with death , signifying the end of the realm of piracy . but things get interesting from there on . action packed and fast paced , we witness the fellowship of pirates braving the strong winds , the chilly weather to get to davey jones ' locker . the story moves on and after they all get out of the locker , things get even more interesting -lrb- and confusing ? -rrb- . its not until the final parlay is decided upon , that the odd viewer would get to know whats gon na happen . the final battle sequence is one to remember for a long time . the sequence of the dutchman and the pearl in the midst of a whirlpool was absolutely mind blowing . not to forget the witty tactics of sparrow swinging on a rope . in the end however all works out well . and its strange irony that about the fate of the characters which is so different from the one chalked out in the beginning . turner becomes the captain of the most notorious ship of the seven seas and elizabeth becomes the pirate lord . sparrow as usual the witty sailor gets his ends meted out floating on a dingy with his destination on course , barbossa suffers from jack sparrow 's wit . the producers did leave an opening for a sequel and i pray they do so . this entire trilogy was great . i never thought that only 3 years after the lord of the rings we will be showcased to such a epic event of this magnitude . but undoubtedly captain jack sparrow will be one of the most coveted and unforgettable characters in hollywood history . no point harping on the cinematic of the movie . right from the acting , the direction , the background score , the plot , screenplay , cinematography , visual effects . everything was stunningly exquisite . although one might say that it was a tad to long . but i felt it was just about right . though i did feel gore verbinsky had too many sub plots . and that might have bogged the movie down a slight bit . he could have played the sub plots a bit longer that would have put a lot more focus on them , or could have clipped a few of them . needless to say this should be showered with oscars . thank you jerry bruckheimer for a wonderful trilogy . thank you gore verbinsky for an epic cinematic experience . and thank you johnny depp for creating jack sparrow .		10		1
the great talents of michael powell and emeric are noticeable in their wonderful `` a matter of life and death '' . it was part of the recent tribute to mr. powell that played at the walter reade in new york . this film , in particular , shows us one of the best british films from that , or any other era . `` a matter of life and death '' has a brilliant cinematography by jack cardiff , a man who knew how to work wonders with a camera . particularly impressive is the contrast from the monochromatic tones given to the scenes played in heaven , and the colored ones when the action comes back to earth . this was quite a coup , and well ahead of its times . the black and white sequence that involves the long staircase where peter and the conductor are chatting has to be one of the most amazing things on any film . much has been said in this forum about the film , so our comment will be about the great acting powell and got out of the large , distinguished cast , who responded magnificently to the directors ' guidance . david niven , is peter , whose aircraft is hit and his best friend dies as a result of it . this film marked one of the highlights in mr. niven 's career . he was an excellent film actor as he shows us in this movie . kim hunter is surprisingly good as june , the woman who talked to peter as his plane was falling from the skies . as fate would have it , peter and june fall in love at first sight . some of the best british film actors grace this film with their presence . robert coote , is bob , the man who is admitted to heaven , but he is surprised his friend peter never made the trip with him . an excellent star turn by marius goring , who as the conductor 71 steals the film . mr. goring , who had worked with the directors , is one of the best things in the movie . also , roger livesey , as dr. frank reeves , does one of the best appearances of his career , as well as raymond massey , who is seen as abraham farlan . `` a matter of life and death '' is a timeless film that will always be seen with gratitude toward its creators .		10		1
the ingredients of gw pabst 's pandora 's box are the kind that could be made into such insane melodrama that it might make josef von sternberg uneasy -lrb- or , if not , the average director of german cinema of the period -rrb- . it 's about a girl who has n't a real home or family , except for those she gets closest to as an of men . one of those is a dr. ludwig schon , who is already betrothed to another - more respectable - woman , but still dotes on his lulu , with short black hair and a charming but seductive face and eyes . she even lures in his son , alwa , who finds the rather crude but ca n't keep his eyes off of her , even as he tries . but soon word gets out about the doctor and lulu , and his reputation is tarnished , and at the night of their wedding as a giant , crazy celebration takes place , dr. schon ca n't take it anymore -lrb- how she acts around others , such as , well , men -rrb- , and reaches a dramatic high point with her ... that is , for this act . from then on we see lulu trying to escape trouble and capture from the authorities for a crime she actually did n't commit -lrb- it 's one of those scenes that sounds far more simple than it looks -rrb- , and either getting by fine like at a gambling joint with her fellow travelers , rodrigo the theater promoter and alwa , or not as it turns out at christmas-time . pabst does n't ever paint much of a happy time for lulu , and it 's just the way it should be in such waters : lulu is a free spirit , at least in theory , and she loves -lrb- or thrives on -rrb- drawing in men into her grasp , except for those few that she actually does n't really want at all , and ultimately she becomes a prostitute in spite of her aim early on to be a dancer and performer on stage . the story itself , while strong and potent with the kind of depth and misery that reminds one of other german expressionist films of the time , is n't even the best thing about the movie . on the contrary , pabst could have made the same elements in this script , full of romantic twists and and harrowing grasps for life and just crazy bits of crime business , into a ludicrous thriller , something out of ten cent paperback books . but it 's pabst as a director of movement in cinema , how he portrays his actors on screen and gets body language and movement in a frame , the lighting and the smoke and fog , the sets expressing place and class , and how he casts it that makes it so great a film . it 's a signal of what makes a movie amazing when one can see a filmmaker elevating a torrid drama into real depth , pain and anguish and lust , not to mention the dangerous exuberance of the period , and that it works even today . there is gunther krampf 's cinematography as one piece of what makes it work , and how the rhythm of the shots in the editing is done in classical structure of scenes -lrb- sometimes a scene will pick up the intensity , such as the jack the ripper scene near the very end , and it becomes exciting much like , or more-so , a modern melodrama today -rrb- , and , depending on which music you listen to with the film on the criterion dvd -lrb- i picked improv piano , which turned out well -rrb- it provides a perfect kick with the material . there is all of that , but it 's louise brooks in her most notable and wonderful performance , that makes pandora 's box stick with you . she has a quality like any star should have , but not having to speak she can rely precisely on her looks , her allure and her smile , her perfect moments of hysteria -lrb- i.e. the backstage theater scene with dr. scholl is perfect -rrb- , and how she projects some real sorrow like in the courtroom scene . brooks taps into a wild soul who is caught in her own game of playing men in society , and pabst taps into her star to make something you ca n't take your eyes off of . another star or actress would have made it interesting , but brooks , who would only go on to star in a few other movies worth mentioning -lrb- also directed by pabst -rrb- , is fearless with the character , and makes her as recognizable in the history of german film as dietrich in the blue angel . it 's artful film-making and a sumptuous actress in a film -lrb- in eight countries ! -rrb-		10		1
it was only after watching this film -lrb- subtitled a song of two humans -rrb- , listed in the book 1001 movies you must see before you die , that i found out it was one of the few silent films to be nominated and win in the first ever academy awards ceremony in 1929 , along with the films wings , the crowd and the jazz singer , and i was really happy with the result , from director f.w. murnau -lrb- nosferatu , a symphony of horrors -rrb- . basically a woman from the city -lrb- margaret livingston -rrb- is vacationing in the country , and lingers around a lakeside town , and at night she goes a farmhouse , whistling to the man -lrb- george o'brien -rrb- who is spending time with his wife -lrb- oscar winning janet gaynor -rrb- and child , and reluctantly he walks towards the woman , his wife thinking memories of when their love was more deep . after kissing passionately , the woman suggests to the man coming with her to the city after selling the farm as it is not doing well

they then go into the photographers shop and prepare for their photograph together , and they can not help kissing together feeling so passionate for each other , unknowingly this is the photograph

barber and eddie boland as the obliging gentleman . with no dialogue the performances are what count the most , o'brien is a great sympathetic character who may have gone a bad route but is a kind man , gaynor as the first woman to ever win an academy award is perfectly beautiful and endearing as the wife who rekindles her love with her unstable but loyal husband , and with her moments on screen livingston is suitable as the one who could have stolen the husband . the film has its dark moments , but overall it feels really charming , witty and sweet story at heart about the revival of a

a classic tale of suspense and intrigue set in post wwll vienna , ` the third man , ' directed by carol reed , stars joseph cotton and orson welles . looking for work , american pulp fiction novelist holly martins -lrb- cotton -rrb- arrives in vienna to accept a job he has been offered by his old friend , harry lime -lrb- welles -rrb- , who he has not seen in many years . but martins is greeted at his hotel -- not by lime , as he had expected -- but with the news that lime is dead , having been hit by a truck two days earlier . arriving in time for the funeral , where he takes note of those in attendance , martins afterwards makes the acquaintance of a select few who knew and were involved with his old friend , harry , beginning with a representative of the authorities , a certain major calloway -lrb- trevor howard -rrb- . lime , it seems , was a wanted man , connected with some nefarious dealings on the black market . initially , martins is skeptical , but it 's only the beginning of the mystery that is about to unfold about him . in talking with those who knew lime best , especially those present at the time of the accident , martins begins to notice some inconsistencies in their accounts of what happened that day . and the one discrepancy that bothers him the most is that in the official report , two men were said to have carried lime -- just after he was hit -- from the street to the sidewalk , still alive at that point ; but an eyewitness martins uncovers claims that , not only was lime killed instantly , but that another man -- a third man -- helped carry him . so the mystery begins ; the report says two men were with him when he died , and heard his last words . a reliable witness , however , puts someone else at the scene . and martins realizes that therein lies the key ; that to find out what really happened to harry , he must learn the identity of the third man . working from the exceptionally well written screenplay by graham greene , reed rivals the best of hitchcock with this richly textured , stylistic offering . the mystery begins to mount with the opening narration -lrb- by reed in the british version , by cotton in the u.s. -rrb- -- delivered in a conversational tone that is in itself unique compared to the usual cinematic narrative form -- and the tension-filled suspense begins to build from the moment martins arrives , and is maintained by reed until the denouement . and -- in a sense -- beyond , right up until the final frame of the film . outstanding performances , combined with the stark black & white photography -lrb- for which cinematographer robert krasker won an oscar -rrb- -- enhanced by reed 's artistic handling of the camera and his use of light and shadows -- as well as the score by anton karas , makes this one of the most memorable mysteries ever filmed . cotton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as martins , which provides a solid foundation upon and around which the mystery surrounding lime develops . and though lime is afforded little actual screen time as martins assembles the bits and pieces he 's uncovered through his investigation , his enigmatic presence is felt in every scene as if he were there . when he does appear , welles embodies him in such a way that the mystique of this man that has been so cleverly and acutely developed is effectively maintained . welles , in fact , with his naturally dominating countenance was the perfect choice to play lime , and he certainly delivers . his few scenes with cotton , especially one that takes place on a ferris wheel -lrb- which offers a telling perspective into lime 's character -rrb- , are the most memorable of the entire film . cotton 's performance , however , is the real thread that holds it all together , and as martins , he demonstrates his generosity as an actor ; for it 's that ` regular guy ' persona with which he imbues his character , that insures the emergence of welles ' lime as so larger-than-life . the same can be said , as well , for the effectiveness with which the mystery of the woman in lime 's life , anna -lrb- alida valli -rrb- , is established . again , martins becomes the sounding board through which valli 's character reverberates so convincingly . her performance is strong , but her interaction with cotton allows her anna to shine all the more brightly . it 's a perfect example of having all the elements that go into the making of a film working together to produce a true classic in every sense of the word . the supporting cast includes paul -lrb- porter -rrb- , ernst deutsch -lrb- kurtz -rrb- , erich ponto -lrb- dr. winkel -rrb- , siegfried breuer -lrb- popescu -rrb- , hedwig bleibtreu -lrb- old woman -rrb- , bernard lee -lrb- sergeant paine -rrb- and wilfrid hyde-white -lrb- -rrb- . intelligently conceived and written , and imaginatively and creatively delivered , ` the third man ' is a masterpiece that works on every conceivable level . the purity of the film is inspiring ; the integrity of the story is never compromised in any way by the sensationalism or cheap gimmicks that seem to plague even the best of today 's offerings -- the fact of which many contemporary filmmakers would be well advised to take notice . in the final analysis , this is simply a truly exceptional film ; one that belongs in the library of every serious collector . i rate this one 10/10 .		10		1
this is an amazing piece of work and it probably tops `` the insider '' , `` the sixth sense '' , `` edtv '' and `` bringing out the dead '' as my favorite film of the year . alan ball 's screenplay is one the modern wonders of the world and sam mendes 's direction matches it -lrb- i can see why he bested michael mann as the l.a. film critics director of the year -rrb- . where did these guys come from ? this story of an american family and the tiny slice of the world they live in is unspooled before us with the precision and fascination of a geneticist unravelling a strand of dna through an electron microscope . this is not to suggest that the film is cold -lrb- far from it -rrb- . it just felt like i was watching the characters lives from beneath their skins . rarely have i felt like i knew an entire cast so well . this will be a hard movie to reward at oscar time because every single performance hit exactly the right key -lrb- `` l.a. confidential '' had the same problem -rrb- , but obviously kevin spacey and annette benning should lead actor noms . spacey has played laconic many times before -lrb- i ca n't think of a film where he has n't been this way before -rrb- , but not with the dry wit and comic timing he displays here . even when he blows up it is dry . benning has her best role since `` the grifters '' and makes the most it . she is a stepford wife with real ambition . they are a married couple who long ago gave up on the american dream but are too comfortable to give up the amercian facade and this is ball 's key contempt . it is a very unique view . while the adults know that they are screwed up the kids still fight to have hope . it is their rebellion . thora burch is outstanding as the lone child of spacey and benning who is getting killed by her parents ' cynicism . the most frightening performance is given by wes bentley as the next door neighbor kid who is constantly peeping and taping other people 's lives , but also finding beauty amid the ugliness and chaos in some of the film 's most moving scenes -lrb- a lot people will not get the significance and meaning of the paper bag , but those who do understand the film completely -- i thought is was awesome -rrb- . i think he is acting as the filmakers . finally mena suvari is a revelation as the smart-ass and all-knowing teenage friend who reveals a heartbreaking vulnerability . this film is very dark but like `` bringing out the dead '' there is a redemptive quality leaves you with hope at the end . i was floored by this . it is also a very funny film . american beauty may be the best film of a very good year .		10		1
despite its bizarre and tragic nature , i can not rate `` sunset boulevard '' highly enough . what a unique film , the likes of which we simply do not see anymore . told in flashback narration by william holden , it tells the story of how he tried to hide from a couple of mobsters who were chasing him and accidentally stumbled across the home of former silent movie star norma desmond -lrb- perfectly played by gloria swanson -rrb- . desmond has a huge ego and believes that everyone is still in love with her films and wants her to make a comeback . as holden is paid to write a screenplay for her , the film 's tragic story begins to unfold . the story does n't matter to this film 's greatness . it 's the way everything about this movie was done that makes it a timeless , excellent movie . it 's some of the best dialogue you will ever hear . see the film once and you 'll remember norma desmond forever . she is a perfect character that gives brilliant acting to every scene . for example , when holden first recognizes her , he exclaims that she is norma desmond , the silent movie star who used to be big , to which she responds , in my favorite line of the film , `` i am big , it 's the pictures that got small ! '' i do n't think there was a more brilliant way she could have said this . swanson was completely robbed for best actress by judy holliday for `` born yesterday . '' you will not see a film this good anymore . i ca n't recommend it enough . if it seems too strange , keep watching anyway , and watch a second time if necessary . absolutely perfect . **** out of ****		10		1
all the performances are excellent but i will give particular praise to brigitte helm , who actually plays five parts in this film . for me , it was the opposites of maria that she plays with such skill ; at one point she 's caring and understanding ; the next , inciting a riot ! quite hard to get across without any sound . the look and feel of the film is just outstanding , given when it was made it is a tremendous achievement ! the film also proves that special effects are nothing new ; just look at the robot transformation scene and tell me that would have been easy to do in 1927 ! on the down side it does get a little too melodramatic -lrb- for my tastes -rrb- in places , but that 's only a minor glitch in what is without doubt and outstanding piece of work . steelmonster 's verdict : highly recommended my score : 9.6 / 10 you can find an expanded version of this review on my blog : thoughts of a steelmonster .		10		1
after finally seen john lasseter 's fourth , and most recent , feature film , the 2006 cars , i finally can say that i have seen each and every pixar feature film . with the exception of toy story 2 and cars since the 1998 a bug 's life until the 2009 up i saw all of them on the big screen -lrb- not sure if i saw toy story on the big screen but is a fact that i saw it , just like toy story 2 , many times on vhs -rrb- but anyway , i saw cars for the very first time complete last thursday on blu-ray -lrb- visually was , obviously , a delight -rrb- , before i had seen some parts on tv , like the part when the protagonist , race car lightning mcqueen -lrb- voice of owen wilson -rrb- , is sleeping while his driver , the truck mack -lrb- the detail of the gim me cap is just fantastic -rrb- , takes him to california for the race that mcqueen will have to win to be for the very first time the champion of the piston cup . i had seen that part at least a couple of times on tv , is a big plot point that will lead lighting mcqueen simply to a new life . there 's a certain thing with the hero of this movie		10		1
well it does n't get any better than casino . the cast , acting , directing , cinematography , music , and story are top notch and it makes for a memorable watch . in my opinion this is scorsese 's best film and could watch it over and over again . it is a great mobster film that follows ace rothstein -lrb- deniro -rrb- and has many trials and tribulations that comes with trying to run tangiers casino for the mob . do n't miss this movie and it is one you should see before you die . put it on your list of must see movies . if you are interested in more details ... again , it is my favorite film of all time so i am a bit biased . that said , scorsese entrenches you in las vegas and ace rothstein 's reign of the tangiers casino . nicholas pileggi does n't put out anything but quality material and him and scorsese together are like peanut butter and jelly . you ca n't say enough about scorsese directing and vision in this film . i ca n't think of a movie that was better put together and has such a great and natural flow to it . on to the acting and casting , which is nothing short of superb . robert deniro is ace rothstein and does a fantastic job . it is n't his best work , but you could n't have found a better actor to play the part . joe pesci is outstanding as nicky santoro and plays one of the most memorable characters in my recent memory . sharon stone is great as ginger and it is arguably her best work to date . you take all that into account with the supporting cast and you have something special . the movie is lengthy , but everything about it does n't make it seem so long . i am telling you it will go much faster than the two and half hours that it runs and be impressive the entire way . the directing and cinematography are something to marvel and i do n't think it gets any better than this film . i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a outstanding gangster film . this ranks as my favorite film of all time and you wo n't be disappointed . email me at filmwatchinfool@gmail.com		10		1
i like terrence malick , i appreciate his style , i love his films . i adore days of heaven , for me it is perhaps my second favourite of his films with thin red line just beating it . the pace as is the case with malick , i 'd go as far to say it is a characteristic of his , is meditative , but deliberately so i think . i do n't see it as a problem , in fact i think the pacing added to the film , it made us care for the characters and story more . the film succeeded with that . the characters are those we empathise with , and the story is probably the most beautiful in tone and in development of all malick 's movies . the score is also beautiful and of haunting quality , and again as is the case with malick the visuals are breathtaking particularly in the cinematography and scenery . also i do n't think that malick 's direction has been as poetic as it has been here , that 's not saying much though he is a very poetic and ambitious director , or that lead actor richard gere has been any better than he is in days of heaven . overall , a wonderful film . 10/10 bethany cox		10		1
` the tree of life ' : five stars -lrb- out of five -rrb- terrence malick writes and directs yet another overly ambitious overblown cinematic masterpiece . yes it is far from flawless but it 's still a masterpiece none the less . malick 's previous films have included 1973 's ` badlands ' , 1978 's ` days of heaven ' , 1998 's ` the thin red line ' -lrb- after a 20 year break ! -rrb- and 2005 's ` the new world ' . all of his other films have been very grand and epic in scale -lrb- except for his earliest work -rrb- but none of them even start to compare to this . with this it 's like malick is attempting to make the perfect film , one comparable to the greatest art of all time , and for that he has been criticized greatly . some call malick pretentious , too full of himself and some have said he has a ` god complex ' . all this may be true but he 's still a great director and this film is in my opinion his best work to date -lrb- as flawed as it is -rrb- . the film attempts to answer the greatest of all questions : ` why are we here and what is our purpose ? ' . it centers on a family in 1950 's texas . brad pitt and jessica chastain -lrb- who bears a striking resemblance to bryce dallas howard and was even born with the same last name in the same month and year , but is no relation -rrb- star as mr. and mrs. obrien . the story focuses on the eldest of their three sons , jack -lrb- played by hunter mccracken in his debut role -rrb- , and is narrated by him as an adult in modern day -lrb- played by sean penn -rrb- . the film follows jack 's coming of age as he struggles with his abusive but loving father . he explains as an adult how he 's come to question everything after the recent loss of one of his brothers . the movie attempts to depict the meaning of life , god and our place among things through the mind of jack . it even has a detailed scene exploring the creation of the universe and it 's first inhabitants -lrb- dinosaurs -rrb- . the editing is very quick and all over the place , making it very hard to follow at times . the narrative flashes back and forth from the present to the 50 's , as well as the beginning of time , in a very hectic and somewhat overwhelming fashion -lrb- at least for the first 30 minutes or so -rrb- . it does settle into a more relaxed and coherent method of storytelling and pacing as the movie goes on but it definitely takes a little while to get used to it -lrb- at the screening that i saw multiple people walked out on it , in the first 30 minutes , before they even gave it a chance -rrb- . the cinematography is beautiful and the visuals are breathtaking . malick 's directing style sort of reminds me of a more artistic michael bay in many ways . the film is definitely not for everyone , as you can probably tell -lrb- it already has a great deal of haters -rrb- , but those who do like it will most likely love it . it definitely is flawed both in style and compass but it aims so high that this was almost always a given . walking away from it i was torn , quite a bit , on my overall opinion of the film . i really liked the film 's emotional elements , strong character study and miraculous ability of capturing both the magic and trauma of childhood -lrb- it reminded me of what it 's like to be a child perhaps more than any other film , not with the father conflict -lrb- my dad was great -rrb- but in almost every other way -rrb- . i did n't like the film 's overly broad scope though as well as it 's bizarre franticness -lrb- i thought those elements really hurt the film , at first -rrb- but the more i thought about it i really began to admire the film despite those elements and maybe in part because of them . the movie is nearly impossible to take in and fully understand in one sitting , so i really want to see it again before i know how i completely feel about it -lrb- sadly it only played in local theaters , at 9th st. cinemas , for one week before it was pulled . i 'm hoping the darkside will get it soon as well -rrb- but the fact that i desire seeing it again so quickly and immensely is a true testament to the power of the film . it 's like nothing else you 've ever seen before and will undoubtedly be examined , over and over again , for many years to come ! truly groundbreaking cinema -lrb- despite it 's flaws -rrb- . watch our review show ` movie talk ' at :		10		1
prior to 1997 , i had known loosely about china 's occupation of tibet . that year , two movies came out that vastly opened my eyes to the whole ordeal : `` seven years in tibet '' and `` kundun '' . while the former stars brad pitt and focuses on heinrich 's experiences with the dalai lama , the latter stars non-professional actors and focuses on the dalai lama himself . we see him go from a boy suddenly thrust into the role of this important figure in buddhism , to a man having to deal with the chinese occupation of his homeland . probably the most important thing that the movie does is show that the dalai lama is more than a figure talking about peace and goodwill ; he 's a normal human being like the rest of us . i will say that the focus on his life becomes so overwhelming that it 's rather hard to digest ; in my case , i started thinking to myself that the buddhist architecture looked like an apartment complex . but overall , i would say that this is one of martin scorsese 's best movies ; back when he was making `` taxi driver '' and `` raging bull '' -lrb- also masterpieces -rrb- , who would have ever guessed that he would make this ? i wonder why the movie never mentioned heinrich .		10		1
it so often happens that some films take the long way to achieve their status of classics and worthy of being studied , frame by frame , by movie lovers who believe in the power of raw performance and skilled direction of cameras to depict a powerful visual set of images . when one sees films like vertigo which barely registered with movie-going audiences at the time of their release but after restoration went on to become one of the best films of the last century , it only shows that film , as an art , does n't need a golden statuette to have merit , and when it 's done exceptionally well , it can be seen in any context and any time period beyond its release date and will still hold its audience in awe . carl theodore dryer , to me , created what i believe is , alongside orson welles ' citizen kane , the most powerful black and white film in cinema history . it would be difficult indeed to say which one is better since both films are landmark in their own cinematic styles and have been dissected frame by frame . dryer 's film has been criticized for either being a pretty collection of still images or being pure visual power : i choose the latter , because in watching the passion of joan of arc , i felt not only the extremely uncomfortable intimacy between joan and her tormentors , but her sublime emotions as they pass through her face as she is mocked , cross-examined , humiliated , and burned at the cross . there is an unearthly beauty in falconetti 's face as she goes through the ringer of emotions not in the overacting style typical of the twenties but in a completely modern way , as if she were living a reality so far removed from the corrupted priests who bash and condemn her , and her reality would therefore be dangerous to their own beliefs . and what a stroke of genius , i think , to have the lighting on her face be soft , gentle , in contrast to her detractors who are always lit in harsh light which exacerbates their ugliness and betrays their `` devotion '' to god as mere politics . dryer 's style of cutting from one actor to the other is also different , and makes this film a surrealist experience , an unsettling , abstract tour through transcendental suffering . there are no defining shots which tell us where exactly is the story taking place -lrb- although we do n't need to know after reading the transcripts -rrb- , but we never are allowed as viewers a moment of rest from this suffocating intimacy between joan and her inquisitors . some bizarre shots and camera angles give the ending an even more disturbing and horrifying element of what we perceive as a gross injustice to what was a person who held her own beliefs and did not need the church to sustain it . falconetti never did a film before this one and never returned to film acting after this . i have not read much about her , except that she lived in argentina until her death in 1946 . i sometimes wonder why she did n't act again -lrb- although she was known to be an accomplished theatre actress more known for comedies than drama -rrb- but those are the mysteries of actors who do n't have the star ego and only make a few films . she came , only did this masterful performance , and left just as suddenly , and those who re-discovered this film and restored it to its full quality have to be commended for allowing us , who have come almost 80 years later , to experience the power of subtle acting .		10		1
paul , a former marine and founder of iraq and afghanistan veterans for america , said that `` not everyone comes home from the war wounded , but ... nobody comes home unchanged , '' indeed , the army 's first study of the mental health of troops who fought in iraq found that about one in eight reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder : flashbacks , nightmares , feelings of detachment , irritability , trouble concentrating and sleeplessness . even more distressing is the fact that the suicide rate among veterans is almost four times the average for of the same age . the possible reasons behind these statistics are spelled out in kathryn bigelow 's magnificent the hurt locker , a heart-wrenching film that explores the world of explosive ordinance disposal technicians in iraq whose job is to locate and disarm ieds . structured around the 38 days three men in the eod squad have left in their rotation , the film is set in baghdad in 2004 and shot with a hand held camera that underscores the sudden movements and constant tension of the unit which must constantly scan rooftops and hiding places for possible snipers . in the opening sequence , eod team leader , sgt. matt thompson , -lrb- guy pearce -rrb- is killed when , after his robotic hardware device fails , he is forced to manually neutralize a bomb that explodes . mirroring the opening quote from american author and journalist chris hedges , `` the rush of battle is a potent and lethal addiction , for war is a drug , '' thompson 's replacement , sgt. william james -lrb- jeremy renner -rrb- , thrives on the adrenaline rush his job entails , seemingly oblivious to the dangers he faces or even the reality of the world around him . unsurprisingly , problems with the other two officers on the squad soon manifest . sgt. j. t. sanborn -lrb- anthony mackie -rrb- , a by-the-book soldier finds james a bit too willing to disobey protocol and take unnecessary risks . called `` a wild man '' by a visiting colonel , sgt. james claims to have dismantled 900 ieds . at one point , james takes off his protective helmet and disconnects his communications gear so that a disbelieving sanborn is unable to communicate with him . in addition , his reckless actions seems to enhance the fears of specialist owen eldridge -lrb- brian geraghty -rrb- , who is seeking private counseling for his obsession with death . though james is a `` hot dog '' , he is a complex character as portrayed by jeremy renner in an oscar caliber performance . he befriends an iraqi boy who sells dvds , gives his support to the troubled eldridge , calls his wife and young son frequently , and reaches out to sanborn though their perspective on life is vastly divergent . written by journalist mark boal who had spent time with a bomb disposal unit , the hurt locker lacks a coherent narrative but its strength lies in the experience not in the story . while the film does not offer a political commentary on the war in iraq , it more than brings home the insanity of all wars . no sequence in any recent war film is more horrifying than the scene in which james has two minutes to dismantle a time bomb strapped to an iraqi suicide bomber . while the would-be bomber pleads that he is a family man , james races against the clock but even his normally cool demeanor gives way to a chilling desperation , an experience increasingly felt by everyone in the theater .		10		1
first let 's start with the undeniable respect for mr. clint eastwood . producing , directing , and starring in a film is a lot on anyone 's plate but eastwood shows effortless masterwork . clint eastwood gives the performance of his career even better than his other oscar nominated performance in `` unforgiven . '' his voice has n't been and we 've never seen him so bare in character . his scene that proves the worthiness of the performance is his scene when he 's in the church crying . there 's no performance in 2004 that shows more nakedness and more emotion than that of eastwood 's . hilary swank also gives a performance worth remembering . her character of maggie is entirely lovable and believable at all times throughout the film . you love her from the very second you get your eyes on her . the real triumph of her performance is the entire last 1/3 of the film . from the moment of her being paralyzed you feel every bit of pain she feels and every tear she sheds you shed with her . she completely embodied herself into the character . despite the breathtaking performance i still would n't give her the oscar for the 2nd time . the nomination nonetheless was very well deserved . morgan freeman was one of the most overdue actors working today prior to `` million dollar baby . '' the performance was very good but not one of his best . his win was a celebration of all his fantastic films that went unnoticed by the academy . -lrb- the shawshank redemption , driving miss daisy , street smart -rrb- he is a very talented man showing many ranges in his impressive career from drama to comedy and back to drama again . you ca n't help but love `` scrap .

anybody that knows me knows that i 'm a sucker for a sci-fi story . just two years ago i was bowled over by danny boyle 's shimmering spectacle `` sunshine '' which provided human drama and made for one intense thrill ride . two years one and duncan jones releases `` moon '' a low budget , human drama that just happens to be set out in space starring sam rockwell , who happens to be one of my favourite actors working today . all of these ingredients should mix perfectly to create a film that 's highly emotive , beautifully acted and a sight to behold but is this moon landing a giant leap , or just a small step . an astronaut miner extracting the precious moon gas that promises to reverse the earth 's energy crisis nears the end of his three-year contract , and makes an ominous discovery in this psychological sci-fi film starring sam rockwell and kevin spacey . for three long years , sam bell has dutifully harvested helium 3 for lunar , a company that claims it holds the key to solving humankind 's energy crisis . as sam 's contract comes to an end , the lonely astronaut looks forward to returning to his wife and daughter down on earth , where he will retire early and attempt to make up for lost time . his work on the selene moon base has been enlightening -- the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues -- but the isolation is starting to make sam uneasy . with only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to earth , sam starts feeling strange : he 's having inexplicable visions , and hearing impossible sounds . i could go into more depth about the plot of this film but , honestly the less about this film you know the better . firstly the film looks sublime . much like danny boyles `` sunshine '' this low budget spectacle uses effects to enhance the story rather than distract from it . mix that with some harrowing shots of the environment and you 've got a film that both looks fantastic and , thanks to clint mansell 's superb score , sounds great too . sam rockwell is a versatile actor , his range is absolutely phenomenal . one moment he is relaxed and friendly the next he 's ready to slit your eye open with a pocket knife ... but let 's not spoilt that for you . simply put . this is a oscar calibre performance my only major grip with the film was with kevin spacey as gerty who , does a good job , but often distracts you from the realism that the film strides for . all of these elements work just great , mixing together to display some fantastic presentation . it 's the story and the direction that leads me to believe that this is the greatest film of 2009 . the story is told at a steady pace . the film never ruses and the pacing feel organic , but its this slow pacing that made me feel distinctly uncomfortable while watching this film . the filmmakers never shy away from showing you a deserted hallway -lrb- cribbing heavily from `` alien -rrb- and calling it disturbing is a understatement . so much so that once the film decided to give us answers you 're so involved that seem personal to you . the film never shies away from pulling on your heartstrings either ; a phone call to earth makes for one of the most emotional moments of the year . you might not think that `` moon '' is the greatest film of the year , the things i 've described may not appeal to you . however , do n't dismay this film . even if it does n't sound like it for you please go see it . if just to make your opinion on it . verdict : moon is a stunner on many levels . the direction is methodical and precise mixed seamlessly with the tour de force performance from sam rockwell . an eerie , disturbing and moving film , but not without occasional bursts of humour , moon is a refreshing antidote to the dumb action-orientated futuristic fodder has dominated cinemas in recent years . for these reasons alone `` moon '' takes it 's place as one of my favourite films of all time and my favourite film of 2009 . 5/5		10		1
hollywood rarely has chosen musicals as its best picture oscar winners . in 1958 , they did , honoring gigi with 9 academy awards . how well deserved this picture was . the great musical numbers by such an appealing , endearing cast can never be forgotten . from the title song , that also copped the oscar to the night they invented champagne , the film literally sparkles with such performances from leslie caron in the title role , to louis jourdan , surprisingly very appealing in a musical , for this veteran dramatic actor . of course , there is the unforgettable maurice chevalier as the man about town again courting his true love , a wonderful hermione gingold . ah yes , he may not have remembered it that well , but are those twosome great . gigi matures to our very eyes and what a pleasure it is to see this view . gay paris was never lovelier . o to return to those times . magnifique ! ****		10		1

i was blown away by the quality of this movie with overall great performances by everyone involved . they kept the real mma fighters to limited roles with no dialogue where they did n't have to do much more then bring legitimacy of having real mma fighters involved with the movie without bringing the movie down in the process of having to sit through their attempts at acting . the movie centers on 2 brothers who have n't seen each other in a long time . tommy the former prodigy wrestler who went into the marine corps but has something to hide . brendan the older brother who 's a former ufc fighter and now currently a high school physics teacher . both are fighting for the prize money but not for themselves . tommy to help out his fellow marine buddies family and brendan to pay off his mortgage so he does n't lose his house . the best part of this movie in comparison to other mma movies it 's about these brothers redemption and not about your cookie cutter mma movie which just pits an evil promoter against your good guy which is lets be honest quite played out .		10		1

it 's hard for me to articulate how beautiful this movie is . i only know that i was glued to the set the entire time . i thought this was an action movie - one i was use to as a high school student going into chinatown to see a flick about the martial arts . beyond the action scenes there is a deep abiding story that cries out and speaks to your heart . surrounded by great scenic views , a great script , a great cast -lrb- jet li is totally awesome - as always -rrb- , great direction , great set , ... it 's an epic drama . if you have any empathy for another culture this movie will not let you down . you must go see it . 10 + / 10 . - zafoid		10		1

the best of the wizard of oz , dead of night , the cabinet of dr. caligari , greed , le chien andalou , splash , cocoon , cabaret , citizen kane , take the money and run , the producers , heaven can wait , and i could n't catch what else are skillfully woven together to create a movie that has designed for its characters not one uniquely amazing world , but many . the supporting cast is magnificent across the board . orson bean is particularly delightful and believable . keenan and diaz are pure magic together . but malkovich himself gives one of the greatest performances in the history of film . how could he have not been nominated for supporting actor for this ? he reflects so much and so many changes seamlessly as perfection itself . a truly original film . i wonder what spike jonze could possibly do for an encore that 's even more non-conventional than this .		10		1

as it is many times with movies directed by ford , the genre in which they fall is not exactly clear . the man who shot liberty valance has the outlook , though not the visual brilliance , of stagecoach , the 1938 . the subject covers a wide range of issues , reminding us of the young barrister lincoln in ford 's 1937 movie and of the ambiguous and inscrutable ethan in the searchers . having such an elaborated structure and willing to address deeper social and political problems the movie has a tendency to lag behind at some points . fortunately , the all-star cast featuring jimmy stewart alongside the usual ford crew furnishes the scenes with enough energy and star quality . in many ways this can be considered the turning point of the western . the sixties were on their way , the nostalgia for old america and its heroes was becoming prevalent as the western white hat was subject to . leone 's westerns featuring tough , unsympathetic and sometimes unmotivated characters brought the new vocabulary of the day . on the other hand the sixties were beginning to show signs of unrest . new values were being formed , the people were questioning more and more the state authority and the appeal to the constitution was acquiring new meaning . until then racially discriminated ethnic groups were asking for their rights . all of these issues found their way into ford 's movie and its resolution pending on the most symbolic of all western moments : the shootout . from a purely ballistic standpoint i give more credit to the view that it was indeed wayne who did the killing , though that does not imply he was the only one to have inflicted a fatal wound . knowing ford from previous movies i have come to doubt the man 's subtlety , he was not that philosophical or shrewd even as hitchcock for instance . and that is because he did n't need to be , he was a craftsman and one of the best of them . he probably wanted to make wayne the killer in order to simply state that the new america , the one where people can ask for their rights and be treated with fairness and respect would not have been possible without the wayne character and his gun . there is , of course the legend , propagated by many that america was built on the rule of law . ford tired to show that maybe the rule of law was itself an american value that was made possible by the man with the gun . in my opinion ford was being honest about the ambiguous nature of american democracy , it is indeed a powerful democracy , many have learned from it but it emerged out of very shadowy circumstances . the italian leone will push this idea even further and show the wild west was indeed only a place of chaos where the only law was that of survival of the fittest . the only thing missing is the indian and it is interesting to see why the figure of the bad indian has been replaced by the bad american cowboy . this is probably the only thing ford can be accused of : he never tried to understand america from the point of view of its old inhabitants , this was his limit imposed on him by his culture		10		1
most of what needs to be said about lotr has already been said . it 's a fine movie that pleased and delighted even the many nay-sayers who thought that peter jackson would produce another movie like braindead . having now watched the extended version i have to say that it adds a few extra scenes without going too far and just rounds out the story a little more . there are still a couple of scenes i would have liked to have seen in the film , namely the barrow-wights and also the scene after they leave moria where they look into the lake , but very little of any consequence is left out of the story . the cast are all excellent and very much as i imagined them when reading the books many years ago . it 's also refreshing to see a movie where the film is n't carried by one or two main actors . all the cast get significant screen time , and the various sub-stories -lrb- gimli and moria or boromir , for example -rrb- are well presented and not skimpy add-ons to the main plot . there are some liberties with the script and characterization . for example , merry and pippin are now much more along for comic-relief than the serious young hobbits they were in the book . but even this works , as it provides a source of light humour to an otherwise quite dark storyline . and to those that say it 's nothing like the books , well ... just be thankful it did n't turn into dungeons and dragons , or you 'd really have something to cry about .		10		1
wow , what can you say about a film that won 11 academy awards back in the days where the best films actually were honored , not the garbage they salute today . in other words , this film lives up to its reputation and has to be ranked as one of the most memorable movies of all time . nobody who ever saw this film ever forgot the chariot race , for instance , perhaps the greatest action scene filmed without special effects . this can be a very sad film as well . i doubt if i 've ever watched this without a few tears in my eyes at certain points . the scenes with hero 's mother and sister suffering with leprosy are still some of the most heart-wrenching scenes i 've ever witnessed on film . they can just tear you apart . the combination of drama , action and romance , along with very involving storyline is aided by an incredible soundtrack , once again one of the best ever put on film . the more one hears this music , the more was is moved by it . to fully appreciate the cinematography in this film i recommend you purchase the recently-released 4-disc dvd special edition which also includes the first rendition of this story , the silent movie `` ben-hur : a tale of the christ . '' that was name of the book , by the way , the second part of the title being left off the 1959 movie as hollywood slowly began christianity in films . however , there is a reverence for jesus christ in this film , which should be there since it 's a key element of the storyline , even though most folks forget that . in summary , this is about as good an example as ever found of what is labeled an `` epic '' movie . it 's an incredible story transferred memorably on screen .		10		1
so far out of kubricks movies i have seen -lrb- 2001 , the shining , full metal jacket , and eyes wide shut -rrb- , i have declared this to be his masterpiece . it could change after i see dr. strangelove and clockwork orange but i doubt it . the acting in this movie is nothing award winning or worth a nomination but its solid acting . the special effects are excellent , very realistic for the 60s . the sets are fantastic . the directing from kubrick is top notch in every possible way . he should have won for this . its too bad he died without winning an award but hes in good company with hitchcock and scorsese but scorsese will probably win for this year , which is stupid . overall , probably the best science fiction movie ever made .		10		1
ominous music and lush cinematography override a sparse script to create a type thriller , which is deeply introspective , moody , and haunting . indeed , the script can be treacherous if used to try and solve this whodunit puzzle , which is best handled by removing psychological assumptions rather than by piecing together logical clues . even so , the murder mystery plot is to some extent illogical . the strength of the film though lies in its suspense , which is almost unbeatable . it rivals any of hitchcock 's works , to which it is repeatedly compared . the scene showing a knife chipping away at a wooden door is reminiscent of , and more frightening than , scenes showing bird beaks chipping away at a farmhouse door in hitchcock 's `` the birds '' . i like the film too because it is so nostalgic . the reel-to-reel tape recorder and dozens of other props and visual cues , the references to philosophy and mysticism , the morricone film score which at times sounds like the film scores from his spaghetti westerns , all conspire to transport the viewer back to the age of aquarius . the acting is fine . tony musante , suzy kendall , and enrico salerno are perfect for the roles they play . this is one scary movie . minor flaws notwithstanding , `` the bird with the crystal plumage '' is top-notch entertainment for fans of suspense thrillers .		10		1
shadow of a doubt may n't be my personal favourite of hitchcock 's movies , but it is in my opinion one of his most suspenseful and tense films evident from right at the beginning with the cloud of ominous black smoke . in short , it is a brilliant classic thriller . even after first seeing the movie 7 years ago when i was 11 , the film never loses its tension . some people might say it lacks the show-off set pieces that was hitch 's trademark , but i have to say i do n't find that the case . i for one found the climax especially nail-biting . on top of that , the film is very well made , the cinematography once again is faultless and the production values are sumptuous . the music also adds to the suspense and the tension , it is beautiful at times with the mix of lehar 's merry widow overture , which is significant to the story , yet in the more tense scenes , it is powerful , haunting and chilling . the script is also of high-calibre quality , as is hitch 's direction . as are the performances . teresa wright is pretty much the epitome of innocence , while joseph cotton is charming and suave yet somewhat chilling as well as the killer who is wanted in the east for relieving widows of their wealth and their lives . the story is , is n't that complicated and moves along at a reasonable pace if rather slow on occasions . overall , suspenseful , tense and well made , a must see for fans of the master of suspense . 10/10 bethany cox		10		1
outstanding 1965 oscar nominated film for best picture of the year . it would have only taken the likes of the equally magnificent `` the sound of music '' to beat it out that year . with a phenomenal musical score played with lust and grandeur throughout the film , the movie is certainly one of historical significance . it depicts the phenomenon of the communist revolution and how communists got themselves into the army to bring russia further down and ultimate rebellion . zhivago , well played by omar sharif , is a dreamer caught up in such a fiery time . julie christie , as his mistress , is wonderful here and this was quite a year for her as she copped the '65 best actress award for the rather undeserving `` darling . '' rod steiger and tom courtenay deliver powerful performances , especially courtenay , as the protester driven to extremism when he is beaten up during an anti-communist rally . of the entire cast , only courtenay received oscar consideration in the supporting category and it was a shame that he lost to martin balsam in `` a thousand clowns . '' with magnificent visual scenery and david lean 's masterful production , this great film remains a classic through the ages .		10		1
i was astonished to see the relatively low rating on this one . i thought it was much better than the 1999 movie . i did n't see the 2005 movie but i 'd like to see it . i 've seen all the other ones also . i think the story of anakin skywalker is very compelling . the young boy who played skywalker in the 1999 movie really did a good job , and there is some great acting in attack of the clones as well . for example , christopher lee in a menacing role . moreover , i think there were some great focus on details and it had the flavor of the real star wars merchandise . the is just great . i mean , the mercenary . moreover , from a science-fiction point of view it is hard to see anything more visionary these days than what came out of the star wars saga . george lucas is a great visionary and has a great imagination which is also evident in the `` lucasfilm '' such as maniac mansion and zak mccracken . games that had an enormous impact on me as a child . now i look forward to watching the new indiana jones movie ...		10		1
we watch a movie almost every night . seldom is an evening so rich and fulfilling as this evening . this film is everything the movies should be . setting . exotic locations . powerful performances . superb cinematography . nor is there any excess . not in the sex scenes . not in the acting . not in the photography which captures the mood of both the place and time in wonderful pastel hues , intriguing composition and original angles . but the camera never steals the show as sometimes happens . everyone is great but toby jones is especially effective as the dissolute ex-pat waddington . and the ending ... well , it 's the sort of thing that triggers lively discussion at breakfast the next morning .		10		1
i came into this movie with very low expectations and i was just blown away by the time i finished the movie . i did n't expect much because i do n't think fondly of the original series except for the very first one and 2002 's remake was okay , but nowhere near anything like this and i 'm being kind . i also wondered how a rookie director could handle a movie like this , but mr. rupert wyatt did a mighty fine job . this film is a prequel set in modern-day san francisco and tells the tale on how the apes took over the world . it all started with a drug that makes chimps have higher intelligence . the main ape in this movie , caesar happens to be a victim of this drug . when ceasar is taken away from his home and to an ape facility where he is mistreated , that is where the fun begins ... the acting is kind of weak only because andy serkis 's performance overshadows them all . he really played the part just wonderful and i 'm amazed how he was n't nominated for an oscar , even though he was motion-capture . that being said , i think james franco and frieda pinto were good in their roles . overall , this is a movie that highly exceeded my expectations . the visual effects are amazing especially with caesar . i also loved the expression of the chimps ' eyes . certainly better than the remake ten years ago . even though there are some great action scenes which the golden gate bridge scene comes to mind , there is a heart here . that is what the previous plane of the ape films were lacking . i rate this film 10/10 .		10		1
this is not a perfect movie . there are some definite flaws , but they are either forgivable , or they come with the territory . that being said , this is one of the most frightening films i have ever seen . nicole walker -lrb- reese witherspoon -rrb- is a sixteen year old who after spending most of her life living with her mother , has moved to canada to live with her father , steve -lrb- william peterson -rrb- , his new wife laura -lrb- amy brenneman -rrb- and laura 's son , toby -lrb- christopher gray -rrb- . while at a rave , she meets david mccall -lrb- mark wahlberg -rrb- , a hot older guy with whom nicole quickly becomes smitten . but as with every relationship , the smitten learn that even those who seem perfect have their flaws . before long , nicole is wishing she 'd never met him . part of the reason why this film works so well is that the script is brilliant . the dialogue and the characters are so real that the characters become real individuals instead of pawns to be terrorized by the nice . even the character establishing moments , which most thrillers treat as obligatory , are just as engaging as the terrifying ending . it is genuinely refreshing to watch characters who are so real . this is n't an artistic screenplay , but credit must go to christopher crowe for creating dialogue that is so natural the other reason why this film works so well is because the actors populating it are wholly believable . i 've never been a die-hard reese witherspoon fan . she 's a good actress , but there 's something off-putting about her , as if she 's trying too hard to be natural . not here . playing the part with equal amounts independence and naiveté , witherspoon is dynamite . mark wahlberg is terrific as david , playing the sweet guy and psycho equally well . in movies like this -lrb- like `` the hand that rocks the cradle '' -rrb- , the villains run the risk of becoming pawns of the script . not here . david is a living , breathing human being , albeit a very twisted one . william peterson has no problem essaying the part of a dad trying to raise a teenage daughter . amy brenneman is especially interesting as the `` new mom , '' whose attempts to get on the good side of her step-daughter may cloud her judgment . james foley has created a near masterpiece of the genre . he lets everything unfold naturally , and aside from a few minor instances and one over-the-top scene , it 's a perfect film . what occurs here is n't suspense , it 's actual terror . it may be flawed , but i can not let a movie that scared me this much go with anything less than a 10 . this is a dark , brutal and scary film , and it will leave you shaken and exhausted by the end of it .		10		1
it has been over three decades since its birth , yet * the godfather * reigns as the yardstick by which all other gangster movies are brutally scrutinized . only twice has its proprietary mien been challenged - with scorcese 's * goodfellas * in 1990 and david chase 's superlative * the sopranos * in 1999 . everything else runs a far , far fourth behind these juggernauts . from mario puzo 's book of the same name , francis ford coppolla directs the legendary story of an east coast crime lord , don vito corleone -lrb- marlon brando in the eponymous role -rrb- , grooming his eldest son , santino `` sonny '' -lrb- james caan -rrb- to take over the family business , that being , one arm of the italian `` five families '' who run the eastern seaboard 's organized crime . when sonny is brutally gunned down in an dispute , corleone 's youngest son , michael -lrb- al pacino -rrb- , who sought a life removed from the family 's `` business , '' ultimately discovers his familial and business instincts and steps into the breach to take the reins . like the movie itself , its characters have weathered the three decades to become icons by which all other movie gangsters are measured ; most of the actors in these staggering roles never quite shaking off the specter of their characters -- which will surely haunt them far past their own deaths . these archetypes have become so ingrained in our culture that it is almost impossible to think back to a time when they did not exist ; like trying to imagine a world before * smoke on the water * , or * star wars . * very simply , if not for * the godfather * these archetypes would not be archetypes . the movie actually influenced real crime families with its new street vernacular -lrb- `` make him an offer he ca n't refuse '' -rrb- and manner of conducting `` business '' -lrb- that of regarding any means to achieve an end as honorable -- as long as the good of the family was invoked -rrb- . the greatest gift * the godfather * bequeathed the movie-going public was its unapologetic stance on anti-social behavior . beyond `` man with no name '' protocol -- where a lone stranger would operate by his own rules , disregarding anyone else 's well-being for his own ends - here was a family , an organized of sociopaths who followed principles wildly at odds with `` normal '' society 's . yet puzo , coppolla and actors boldly offer no excuses as to their characters ' existence , motives or actions . after our gangster 101 schooling with james cagney , edward g. robinson and george raft , here was a , world only hinted at in those previous gangster genre movies , now fleshed out almost against our will ; here was a world where our societal notions of right and wrong were utterly reversed , yet which made sense in the verisimilitude of its own universe . searing with grand irony , the first line of dialog in * the godfather * is , `` i believe in america . '' and indeed , these characters are not mindless convenience store hijack artists -- they are businessmen in the truest sense of the word . they are also imbued with a strong sense of loyalty and justice . though * the godfather * may seem apologist in its stance towards supposedly heartless criminals , telling the tale from * their * point of view allows us freedom from guilt when we realize that `` crime '' is a subjective term . as don corleone states , when opting not to murder molesters , but rather land them in hospital like their victim , `` we 're not murderers . '' no matter they dabbled in gambling , prostitution , money-laundering and murder , they sought only to be self-sufficient , to keep their families well , and to live comfortably in peace - otherwise called the american dream . in setting the tale in the 1940s , puzo and coppolla removed us from everyday reality from the outset ; in this insular universe we readily accepted the family 's version of morality . it was no stretch to dovetail the authorities ' actions in the film with our suspected perception of them in our reality . matter of fact , it seemed to vindicate our darkest suspicions that the people whom we place our unmitigated trust in for safety from society 's savage shadow dwellers are in cahoots with those very shadow dwellers who are trying to subvert our safety . there are scenes that will be burned forever into your mind 's movie wall : the opening tableau of the godfather presiding at his desk ; the head of racehorse khartoum in jack woltz 's bed ; michael gunning down the police captain ; carlo rizzo being by sonny ; the slaying of sonny ; even scenes like moe greene 's meeting with michael , where he claps his hands together and exclaims , `` you goddam really make me laugh ! '' -- the subsequent bullet through his eye is another ; and the grand `` cleansing '' -- scenes of the east coast bosses being killed systematically juxtaposed over michael renouncing satan at his god-daughter 's baptism ... through it all runs the unbreakable thread of family . the opening wedding scene ends on a poignant note of a father dancing with his daughter . harking back to the familial theme constantly , coppolla reaffirms our deepest vicarious desires . we are all immigrants to some extent , the bonds of our heritages displaced , fragmented , growing weaker over every generation of x-box and internet junkies ; there seems nothing that can bind the strands of our familial threads . we find affinity in the blood bonds of * the godfather * , on some level deeper than the span of oceans and the passage of time . -lrb- movie maniacs , visit : poffysmoviemania.com -rrb-		10		1
twentieth century fox has a banner year in movies in 1946 . this film was one of the best then & still would be today 63 years later . darryl f. zanuck was one of the legendary producers of the time , the razors edge is one of his finest productions . from the novel by maugham ; lamar trotti crafted a brilliant screenplay very ably directed by edmund goulding . the cast headed by tyrone power , gene tierney , anne baxter , john payne , herbert marshall & clifton webb . these 6 stars were among the best actors of the era . each one was brilliant , anne baxter won an oscar for her brilliant role as the doomed sophie . clifton webb was nominated for his acid tongue performance . no one was able to top the actual supporting oscar performance of harold russell in the best years of our lives . in smaller but equally excellent performances were elsa social secretary towards the end & fritz kortner as -- in the coal mining scene . these as well as others added to the full enjoyment of this powerful drama . i was filmed in beautiful black and white , on the sound stages at the studio . the scenes in india were filmed in colorado , one mountain peak is the same as any other . there is very little action , just brilliant of romance but no nudity or sex scenes . non-the-less it still is too mature for children . it would get a pg rating today . i have seen this about 15 times since it was released , i can easily see it many more times . the running time of 145 minutes goes fast . ratings : **** out 4 -- 99 points -- out of 100 imdb -- 10 out of 10 .		10		1
i have always had more respect than love for this film . for a start , i prefer lang 's american films in general , because the german ones , outstanding as they are , can be so heavy , and more depressing than even i can take . secondly , i felt that despite metropolis ' remarkable imagery , there was something simplistic and trite about the film 's ` message ' , and that its politics were more than a little dodgy . thirdly , on a television , the overpowering visuals seemed more like a clever . but mostly , i was put off by georgio moroder 's horrendous vandalism of the film , with his infantile tinting , and his vile music , where his previously impeccable disco pedigree was replaced by a hideous , grating , monstrosity of a tinny , tin-eared , ` score ' . rather than face that , i 've always turned the sound down and played bruckner , which is more than a little unsatisfactory . last night i saw metropolis in the cinema , and the experience was astonishing and revelatory . i can see now why it is revered by so many , a judgement that had puzzled me previously . it is german , and heavy and depressing , but it has a remarkable playfulness absent from much of lang 's work - the fatuous arcadian idyll juxtaposed with the constructivist catacombs of the workers ; the introduction of john frederson , master of the metropolis , with his impeccably attired toadies ; the mad inventor , rotwang ; any scene with the wonderful , disruptive , so preferable to her pious progenitor - a jerky , of frankenstein - witness especially the jawdropping scene where frederson reveals her to his cronies , belly-dancing . these scenes , and many more , do much to leaven and the film 's considerable gloom , without ever undermining it . as for the film 's simplistic plea , lang does everything in his awesome power to destabilise his wife -lrb- and future nazi -rrb- 's schematic script . the film is not simply futuristic science fiction , but exists or refers to three temporal levels - the in which the film takes place ; the vast images this present is contrasted with , showing that history is not a straight line of progress , but a perpetual repetition of greed , power , repression and destruction ; and the medieval , religious world maria leads the workers to as a site of hope and peace . all three involve the repression or subservience of the workers . the medieval realm , which , with its heavy incense and gloom , is quite literally intoxicating , filmed in the style of engravings , mirroring the inferno and the circles of hell of the workplace at the beginning , thoroughly negating the redemption offered by maria . this dichotomy is mirrored in the father/son crisis that structures the film . this parent/child relationship pervades metropolis -lrb- e.g. maria and the children ; the inventor and the robot -rrb- , but rather than assert tradition and order , they spiral into chaos and destruction . the is linked to death and corruption for the son 's hallucinations , as he -lrb- like the inventor -rrb- the seven deadly sins in one extraordinary sequence after discovering maria 's ` betrayal ' . the whole film is a well of repressed urges bursting to the surface , literally so when the very phallic gas tanks burst open . sexual repression and political repression are intimately linked , and their rising to the surface provide some of the film 's most compelling images . and yet the politics , to me , remain very very suspect . metropolis begins as a scathing critique of totalitarianism , and its links with modern capitalism -lrb- especially in the us -rrb- , but ends upholding it , trying to make it work . although lang undermines the obscene reconciliation at the end , by showing the sheer destructive glee of revolution , and making the workers as unthinking and as ever , following the foreman , it is not hard to see why this was hitler 's favorite film . lang has not found a way of giving ` the mass ' an individual voice without demonising it , and the clearly semitic mad inventor -lrb- he has stars of david on both his door and in his lab ; his frankenstein narrative of creation and destruction draws on the jewish myth of the golem ; his bug-eyed insanity is very similar to contemporary caricatures -rrb- is shown to be the root of all the problems in the film , from the creation of the robot , to the flaws in the city 's infrastructure . once he has been disposed of , order can be restored , the master can repress to his heart 's content , while seeming to befriend the workers . i am running out of time , and i 've so much more to say . on the big screen , the true majesty of the set design blooms , but it is not the fully developed , peopled world of , say , blade runner . rather , this is a dream space - appropriate to a nightmare vision of modern society - barely populated . when a crowd walks , or a car suddenly drives by , it is like a dream figure in a vast oneiric landscape , not a regular feature of everyday life . the social rupture of the film 's subject matter is figured in the apparently unassailable inhumanity of the buildings - they are unstable and distorted , waiting to collapse . the faded image of the video is replaced by an extraordinary , beautiful , clear , sharp picture , a triumph of geometry ; an inhuman grid over humanity that finally bursts in the son 's remarkable expressionist frenzy . lastly is the score . the print i saw was provided by the british film institute , and the music was amazing , a victory of understanding , eclecticism , and invention over moroder 's idiocies . jazz alternates with industrial noise or mystical , medieval chanting ; sound effects are used with unerring , evocative precision ; every scene was enriched by a that actually commented on each image , providing an interpretation or insight we may have missed . i wish i had n't forgotten the composer 's name - kasper something , i think - but i urge you to see this bfi version , because with anything else you really need n't bother ; you 're cheating lang , and you 're cheating yourself . genius .		10		1
`` welcome to the dollhouse '' was the introduction of an important voice in the american cinema . todd solondz 's incisive study of a suburban family is one of the best indie films of the last decade . having seen it in its theatrical release , we had the opportunity recently to take a new look at it . mr. solondz has created a picture of what cruelty does to a child , and how prevalent it is everywhere . when we first meet the wieners , living in suburban new jersey , they appear to be the ideal family . both parents , on the surface , look normal , but in watching them closely we come to the conclusion they are not . some couples are not meant to be parents and the wieners , obviously , while supportive of the older son , mark , and the cute younger daughter , missy , turn a blind eye toward dawn , their middle daughter who is going through a hard time as she starts junior high school . not only is dawn an unhappy girl , but she is the object of cruelty in the hands of the other students , both in her class , and in her school , in general . we watch as brandon , the punkish boy , begins to taunt dawn in his own sadistic way . other girls come right out and ask dawn whether she is a lesbian . there 's also another girl that terrorizes her when both meet in the school bathroom . every time dawn tries to rebel , it turns out in disaster . her school teacher does n't even see anything wrong with dawn , who is obviously affected by all she is experiencing at this crucial moment . dawn hits a nerve with brandon when she calls him a retard . little does she know his own brother is mentally challenged . usually in the case of bullies like brandon , they are acting up their frustrations by taking it on others they perceive as weaker , which is why he thinks he can do anything to dawn because she will never do anything to him . in a scene that gives cruelty a new name , we watch as the wieners are having dinner one night . when dawn contradicts something her mother has said , she is punished by not getting her dessert . we watch in total disbelief as the other wieners begin to eat and dawn 's slice of chocolate cake remains near her mother until missy asks to share that piece with mark . dawn only has a friend . the young boy who shares her interests in hanging out in the dollhouse in the wiener 's backyard . when the hunky steve rogers joins mark 's band , dawn discovers an irresistible attraction toward this loser . dawn turns against her only friend and will call him names that we all realize is her own way to deal with emotions she has no control on . instead of finding happiness among her peers , dawn only encounters scorn and ridicule . in heather matarazzo , the director found a young talent to give life to dawn wiener . ms. matarazzo has a peculiar kind of beauty , but she is made to wear horrible clothes to capture the essence of this sad young teen . ms. matarazzo under the guidance of mr. solondz makes an appealing dawn . this young actress gave her character a range of emotions that even older , and more accomplished , actress would n't have given to this lost soul . the rest of the cast is perfect . brendan sexton plays brendan , the boy from a poor and broken home that has to deal with the blow life has given him . angela as mrs. wiener is seen as the mother from hell . mattew faber and daria play dawn 's siblings . this was a film that put todd solondz on the map . as he has shown with later films , he is a voice to be reckoned with in the independent cinema .		10		1
what is amazing about this film is how it still stands up to the times ; still has a theme worthy of exploring ; still comments on the disposable stars and tragedy of the old hollywood system , which still seems romantic and glamorous compared to what we have today . gloria swanson is excellent , william holden the tragic , `` down luck '' writer from ohio , trying to survive in hollywood . many of us know the story , or have seen parodies of it -lrb- for example , on the carol burnett show -rrb- . but if you have any interest in old hollywood , you will love this film . it touches on isolation , aging , psychosis , and melodrama in a most unique way . the visuals are gothic and haunting . the old floor on which valentino danced the tango , the old stars at norma desmond 's house , discarded , playing cards to pass the time . the omniscient olympic sized swimming pool , never haunted by guests . a mansion filled with memories and mementos , but not people . sunset boulevard today has but a few old buildings , modern life has all but erased the old hollywood which existed at that time . today it is a strange anachronism to see grauman 's chinese theatre , and advertisements next to it , for todays movies . this film is worth seeing more than once . 10/10 .		10		1
i just had the luck to watch this movie on the big screen and i ca n't forget it . jacques tourneur 's out of the past may just be the greatest film noir ever made . it looks like any other , but , to paraphrase bogart , only more so : nicholas musuraca 's black-and-white cinematography is brighter and darker than any film noir 's ; robert mitchum 's character , fugitive detective jeff is more sarcastic and fatalistic than ten sam spades . jane greer plays kathie moffat , an unrepentant , cold-blooded femme fatale whose alliances change as quickly as the weather . kirk douglas is a soft-voiced , mild-mannered villain with a mind and paul valentine plays the coolest henchman ever . and then there 's the unforgettable ending , which represents the essence of the genre . the movie starts simply but develops a byzantine plot full of twists and turns and the most quotable dialogue ever . jeff bailey is a whose shady past catches up with him when joe comes by . bailey is trying to lay low and live a good life , but there is no peace or redemption in this movie , and soon he 's caught in a web of deceit and murder . saying more is unnecessary . what really matters is the dialogue , the back-and-forth witty , sarcastic quips , the expressive acting from the perfect cast , the cinematography and the pervasive atmosphere of doom . although the viewer will be laughing from start to finish , this is no funny movie . the movie is dark , amazingly dark for its time , and no character has illusions about themselves : they 're killers , blackmailers and thieves . robert mitchum 's line , `` baby , i do n't care '' , sums up this movie perfectly . it 's this remorselessness that makes this movie so modern and an exciting film experience .		10		1
stanley kubrick 's end-of-the-world comedy was merely topical back in 1963 ; today the film is essential viewing . no other cold war feature -lrb- and certainly no straight-faced drama -rrb- so accurately depicted the lethal absurdity of the arm 's race , and the chilling consequences of one rational madman pushing the wrong buttons . the stark overhead lighting and low-level camera angles aptly illustrated the combined myopia of the military , scientific , and political communities , with all three represented by the versatile peter sellers in a characteristic triple performance . the supporting roles are no less memorable : george c. scott as air force hawk buck turgidson ; sterling hayden as general jack d. ripper -lrb- who initiates the apocalypse to `` protect and preserve our precious bodily fluids '' -rrb- ; slim pickens as b-52 pilot major kong -lrb- riding the bomb like a bucking bronco to oblivion -rrb- . the giveaway names only underline the broad simplicity of the satire , but oddly enough the sometimes childish -lrb- black -rrb- humor makes an already frightening scenario all the more plausible .		10		1
what can i say ? i had heard that this was a great film but thought only of it as an early version of gladiator -lrb- 2000 -rrb- but i was wrong . ben-hur has all the parts that kept gladiator from being an unforgettable film . judah ben-hur -lrb- charlton heston -rrb- is the young and rich jewish prince of jerusalem . he leads a quiet life and enjoys all the luxuries of a 1st century prince . judah establishes a relationship with roman soldier messala -lrb- stephen boyd -rrb- and are happy to meet again years later while messala commands the new legion moving into jerusalem . but after a freak accident , messala betrays judah and the prince is sent to the galleys . but judah never gives up hope and swears he will come back seeking revenge . heston is brilliant , he 's a strong lead role , and delivers an unbelievable performance . along the path of the story , we are confronted with a variety of biblical characters including : pontius pilate , jesus christ , mary , and balthasar -lrb- one of the three wise men -rrb- . the film is fun overall . it does n't hold the feeling of a 50 's flick but a modern movie . the dialog is pretty good , the acting is at top game , and the sets are amazing for the time . above all , the stadium where the chariot races are held and the sea battle are unbelievable . the film makes sense with a message of revenge and forgetting the past . the reason for the extra title ' a tale of the christ ' pretty much has to do with message -lrb- jesus ' character is only in the film for about five minutes -rrb- . this is probably one of the greatest film i have ever seen and recommend it to anyone who wants to see an epic . ben-hur . starring : charlton heston , stephen boyd , finlay currie , haya harareet , and sam jaffe . 5 out of 5 stars .		10		1
is there anybody on the planet who has not succumbed to both audrey hepburn and this , her first leading role . sadly the answer must be yes because there are always those who fail to ` get ' it or to ` see ' the enchantment . the fact that dalton trumbo has now been accorded his rightful screenplay credit could well lead to speculation about the basic premise given that trumbo was often accused of ` smuggling ' left-wing ` messages ' into his pre-hollywood ten screenplays : everybody and his uncle max is familiar with the marxist credo , ` workers of the world unite , you have nothing to lose but your chains ' but did , we wonder , trumbo adapt this to read ` royals of the world abscond , you have nothing to lose but your privileges ' then have audrey hepburn 's princess ann run away from the shackles of protocol . alas , that 's about as far as we can run with this because the true marxist would then assassinate the whole royal family for an encore whilst hepburn 's princess , cognizant of her ` duty ' returns to assume the role life has chosen for her . in that respect this answers the description of the bildungsroman in which a child comes of age via a rites of passage episode and if we feel sadness on hepburn 's behalf in the opening scenes when , as a grown woman she is treated as a child not least by her own lady-in-waiting we rejoice at the end when , for the first time , she asserts her authority and dismisses that same lady-in-waiting . in between lies some heavy-duty enchantment with peck and hepburn falling hopelessly into a hopeless love laced liberally with laughter and tears and great support from eddie albert . along with billy wilder 's sabrina fair this represents the best of hepburn which is really saying something given the consistent high standards of her later work but just as you can only fall in love for the first time once so you can only play your first leading role once and she was so lucky to have gregory peck , one of the most underrated actors in hollywood , to share it with her . total joy . fifteen out of ten .		10		1
what a film !! i wo n't waste much time talking , i just have to say that this is the best animated film i have ever seen !! from the initial opening right through to the full circle ending , this one has the correct pace and the visual strength to be , in my opinion , the best disney movie ever !! everyone needs to see this film , whether your 4 or 80 , you need to see this . it 's sooooooooo beautiful , and it boasts probably the most villainous baddie ever !!! scar . great array of vocal talent , and lovely storyline , this one must be seen . perfect 10 for this ` king of the jungle ' !!!!! enjoy !		10		1
case 39 is certainly a deserving recipient of an edge-of-your-seat thriller award . the film has been a long time coming and it 's strange that no distributors were willing to touch it since 2009 . but it 's here and it 's piping hot . it stars the talented renee zellweger as a child services worker . the overworked social welfare department has too many case loads to deal with . and when case 39 is assigned to zellweger , she immediately takes a personal interest in it . it 's the sad story of a girl whose grades are slipping and whose home life is anything but benign . the film does a 180 ' turn and soon the benevolence of zellweger is greeted by a horrifying reality . this case is anything but benign . if you 're prepared for horror , this is going to scare you witless ...		10		1
i like david lynch and his movies , my favourites being the elephant man , mulholland dr , blue velvet and this . i do n't think i can add very much to the previous reviews that sum it up so nicely , but i 'll do my best . the straight story is not a complex movie , the script is quite simple but it did n't need to be . despite its simplicity , the script is also very moving and literate and you can tell a lot of heart went into shaping it . the film is also quite meditative in its pace , but again that did n't bother me at all , because as a quite reflective piece of work the meditative pace was deliberate . besides , even if they were flaws , which i do n't think they are if anything they are strengths in regards to the straight story , the film has a number of things to love about it . for one thing , the straight story is beautifully filmed with the cinematography fluid and the scenery spellbinding . the score adds to the film 's poignant tones , in terms of direction the straight story is one of lynch 's best directed movies and the story while simple is beautifully told and surprisingly warm too . also richard farnsworth gives a wonderful lead performance , he genuinely moved me and i felt for his character too . in conclusion , a beautiful film and one of lynch 's best . 10/10 bethany cox		10		1
harrison ford continues his role of han solo but instead of space , it is set in the 30 's . this is a perfect time to set the film because it was the time when people explored the world , as it was opening up more to them with the invention of the plane . they especially liked to explore old civilisations and dig up archaeological finds . indiana jones is instantly recognisable with his whip , hat and leather jacket . what is interesting about him is we see him fight and do all those incredible stunts and yet his one fear is snakes . it was such a brilliant idea to have the nazis as the bad guys and have them after important artifacts such as the ark of the title which would make them invincible . they are the ultimate villains who the audience would boo and root for indy to win , it is a classic good vs. evil battle . the stunts and special effects are mind-blowing . i was very impressed at how they did the scene where the faces melted away , it was so convincing and it is more inspiring to know they did n't have the technology they have today to do those scenes . there have been complaints that this does n't show archaeology in the right way , it is not as exciting as the film but to fair , they could n't do what the real archaeologists do because the audience would n't find it interesting to watch for 111 minutes . the film has everything - romance , comedy , action and adventure which appeals to me .		10		1
i might consider putting this movie in my top 10 list of best movies . it 's absolutely amazing that for his directorial debut , robert redford created such a masterpiece . now it was not all due to him , as the story was so well-written and the acting is dead on for all the characters . part of the reason i love it so much might be because i was a psychotherapist before becoming a school teacher -lrb- mid-life crisis , you know -rrb- . and , having worked with dysfunctional families , this movie gets it right time and time again . therapy is not a miracle cure that takes effect almost immediately -lrb- like in good will hunting -rrb- and the parents both have a strong role in keeping the family sickness alive . donald sutherland is the enabler who denies there is a problem -- even after one son dies by accident and the other attempts suicide . he also can not face that the family 's dysfunction is mostly controlled and maintained by his very disturbed wife , played wonderfully by mary tyler moore . she is not mentally ill but has a very sick personality , as she is cold as ice emotionally and deals with problems through massive amounts of denial as well as stuffing her anger way down deep . timothy hutton is , despite his being the patient , the healthiest one in the family , as his suicide attempt is a strong cry for help . finally , judd hirsch plays the therapist -- and one of the most realistically portrayed therapists on film . he has no miracle cure but tries his best to get hutton , and later sutherland , to work hard at uncovering their dysfunction . again and again and again , the viewer is rewarded by a brutally honest script that is about people who would be real -- not hollywood 's idea of `` people '' . the film is neither manipulative nor condescending -- this is the way more films should be . in addition , as i have watched the film several times , i keep noticing just how perfect the direction was . how wonderfully framed the shots were , how wonderfully the music fit in and how unflinching the movie dealt with pain . in particular , i love the scene with sutherland at the psychiatrist 's office as he talks about his marriage ... and his eyes keep looking away and avoiding the doctor as he says how much he loves her . and the great christmas photo scene -- it just screams out `` this is real !! '' . for this to be robert redford 's directorial debut is absolutely amazing and he surely earned that best director oscar . fyi -- although this movie is rated r , it is only for language . there are a few really choice words used here and there , but otherwise this is a great movie for teens . if filmed today , this would no doubt be a pg-13 film . i am a very conservative parent , and yet i found this to be totally acceptable for my 15 year-old . it 's a great film to watch with your kids and discuss what you see . i can not recommend a film more highly .		10		1
i simply love this movie . it is one of the classics in my opinion . it may not be that well known but when i first saw it i was captivated by the siege of the undead on the castle and loved it so much that i returned and saw it later at the cinema again . now every so often i see it in the video store and go and hire it . when i recently hired it i noticed that they had released a directors cut with a different ending . usually the director 's cut is a little better that the original but i do n't know with this one . i did like the original ending where he is back in s-mart and blows away the witch that attacks him , grabs the girl , says `` hail to the king , baby , '' and kisses her . it is such a cool image . army of darkness is labelled as black comedy but i would also put it under the category of satire . what we are laughing at is not just death but also the arrogance of the average american redneck . the cover is that of a comic book movie and the shelf it was on at the local video library was `` cult movies '' . i remember evil dead back when i was a kid . there was a computer game based on it and it was described as the most scariest film ever made . the trilogy originally began as a horror but i was told that when evil dead iii came around , raimi decided that the horror genre was so worn out it drifted into comedy . ash -lrb- bruce cambell -rrb- went on a retreat with his girlfriend and found the necronomicon , the evil book of the dead . the book killed his girlfriend and tried to possess him but he fought it off . the book struck back and dragged him into the past to medieval england where he is captured by the local lord with henry the red . he manages to redeem himself and goes on a quest to find the book to get him back to his own time but unfortunately he awakens the dead and they swarm the castle to get it back . what makes this movie great is the individualist attitude of ash . he is great because he has a gun and a chainsaw and nobody else does . he has attitude and basically acts like your everyday average american , and this stands out in the background of medieval england . unlike most time travel movies , he does not try to blend in , nor does he hide his technology . he simply shoves it in their face `` this is my boom stick !

behold : the greatest film of 2005 ... without question , this is the single most wonderful film i have seen over the previous 12 months . it 's story is simple enough for children but contains a wealth of pleasure and emotion for adults ; it 's also kindhearted -- one of the most optimistic films . it 's quite daring for a project this sincere and good-spirited to be made these days . the cynicism contained in most film , though not terrible , is becoming slightly intolerable . it 's refreshing to see something so nice . danny boyle , known most famously for trainspotting and 28 days later , seems an odd choice for this gentle , moving fable about youth , money , and goodness . whether or not he was the best man for the job is inconsequential because he does such amazing work here that i can not imagine anyone else helming this project . the story is simple and boyle adorns his imagery with occasional flashy maneuvers with his camera or with the aid of computers . in many films , these would appear as . in millions , they complement the fairy tale nature of the film and add another layer of complexity to the tale . in addition to the direction , screenwriter boyce proves yet again that he 's one of the most amazing writers of film today . he may not receive the press of haggis , kaufman , or , but he deserves as much or more praise than those men ; with disparate films such as hilary and jackie , the claim , and 24 hour party people already under his belt , it was no surprise to me that he captured the magic and wonder of childhood in a way that refused to undercut that wonder and joy with irony or condescension . i await his treatment of tristram hungrily . and then there are the kids ... there 's a glut of great child actors starring in today 's motion pictures . the kid from charlie and the chocolate factory and jamie bell come immediately to mind -lrb- not to mention the entirely likable cast of the harry potter films -rrb- . it 's fantastic that boyle and boyce found two more great kids . alex etel is more or less required to carry this film , and he does so with ease . he 's a wonderful actor and an incredibly likable kid . lewis mcgibbon nails the part of alex 's older brother giving what could have been a one - dimensional character -lrb- simply a schemer -rrb- a rounded personality . these two leads are aided to no end by the adults in the cast , particularly james nesbitt . nesbitt is a great british actor and deserves more work . his turn in bloody sunday was eye-opening , and he 's equally good here . i apologize for this review 's overflowing superlatives . i simply feel that boyle has created something special with millions . a film that deals so sensitively with a child 's reaction to the death of a parent deserves all the praise it can , and to infuse the story with a sense of spirituality -- and a hope in the spiritual -- that is not entirely reverent but not condescending either is remarkable . here is a film that maintains a sense of humor around religion without disrespecting believers . most films that even remotely broach the subject of religion and spirituality do so at the polar extremes -- they 're either complete mockeries -lrb- like saved ! -rrb- or self-righteous without piety -lrb- like the passion of the christ -rrb- and in both cases they 're utter and disgusting failures . millions is a very special and moving film , and i encourage everyone to watch it .		10		1
spoilers for the sake of a personal confession , this review of the godfather is not as neutral and objective as it should be . for that i apologise , but with good reason . in august 2003 , after watching `` the godfather '' in what i assume now must have been a tired state , i condemned and criticised this film for being overrated , drawn out and dull . today on the eighth of july 2004 , i apologise for such a flawed review . `` the godfather '' , whilst still perhaps not worthy of it 's number one slot , is one of the best films ever created . in this film , we are introduced to the corleone family . the story starts at the wedding of connie corleone to carlo rizzi . as is tradition amongst sicillian families , connie 's father , the godfather , don vito corleone hands out favours to those who respectfully ask for his help . at the wedding as well are the don 's other children , fredo -lrb- john cazale -rrb- , the violent sonny -lrb- james caan -rrb- and the youngest , the war hero , michael -lrb- al pacino -rrb- . over two and a half hours of film later and the lives of vito and his family are changed forever as this one gangland family fights with external and internal problems . `` the godfather '' is a beautiful piece of cinema . with the late marlon brando putting in a fine performance as vito , the film had a figurehead character . ultimately however , it is al pacino who deserves most praise . rarely can there be shown in a film such a dramatic change in a character over such a space of time . going from a law abiding war hero returning from the second world war with medals and a beautiful wife , pacino 's michael gradually changes in appearance and style as he takes his place at the head of the family . everything about him is designed to show the change in his character . his hair changes style , his clothes change style , even his face changes mannerisms -lrb- although partly due to his jaw being broken by a corrupt police chief -rrb- . pacino as michael demonstrates just how truely awesome an actor he is . the acting alone is not just what makes this film great . the way in which characters are added and removed from the story is clever . nobody is too good a character to be written out and everybody is given a chance to play a key role in the events . the musical direction of `` the godfather '' is another part of it 's beauty . as well as the obvious piece of music which everyone is aware of , the ways in which sound is used to keep our attention at times is superb . the background music and the location from michael 's time in italy is beautiful . all in all , there 's nothing which can be faulted . when i originally wrote a review for this film last year , i complained of how it was overrated and dull , that is a mistake i now regret . `` the godfather '' is a beautiful film that i might not necessarily place at number one in the internet movie database all time list , but which i can see why it is there . this film is a piece which everyone should be forced to watch and a piece which , if they pay attention to it , they will love .		10		1
the man without a past , the second installment in aki kaurismäki 's `` losers '' trilogy -lrb- the first being 1996 's drifting clouds -rrb- , is , to date , the only finnish film to have received a best foreign language film oscar nomination , and deservedly so . it 's a wonderful , heartbreaking opus , and arguably kaurismäki 's finest movie . at the story 's center we find a nameless man -lrb- markku peltola -rrb- , who arrives in helsinki for unknown reasons . that same night , he 's brutally assaulted by a group of punks . this incident makes him look dead , although we immediately learn he is alive , if completely amnesiac . with no idea of who he is or what he 's supposed to do , he starts looking for a home and an employment . he manages to rent a `` house '' in the city outskirts -lrb- do n't miss sakari kuosmanen as the landlord -rrb- and befriends irma -lrb- kati outinen -rrb- , a social worker who tries to help m -lrb- in lack of a better name , and given `` x '' is quite overused -rrb- as much as possible . it is this friendship , which slowly evolves into something deeper , that truly motivates the protagonist in his pursuit of a better life . the man without a past strikes us because , unlike other films involving amnesia , it makes us hope m wo n't recover his memory : what he experiences throughout the movie , the people he meets , that 's what really matters . it 's a little bit like a road movie -lrb- they never end with the characters reaching their destination -rrb- , only this time the voyage involves the mind and the spirit . it 's a similar voyage the director asks the audience to join , as he artfully explores human life and its chances of improvement . moving and reminiscent of italian neorealism -lrb- de sica , rossellini , visconti -rrb- , the man without a past is a flawless reflection on how happiness is to be found anywhere , no matter the circumstances .		10		1
i happen to have seen the original theatrical show in london in the 1970s before ever discovering the film , on vhs first and then on dvd . this is indispensible to understand the new dimension given to the show on this medium , a filmed show on dvd . the show itself is a myth and the plot is known by heart . some extra-terrestrials came on earth with their spacecraft in the shape of an old medieval castle that is in fact a laboratory . the master of the place is dr frank-n-furter and he is a of the never decomposed or decomposing dr frankenstein . he studies one emotion known as lust and being an extra-terrestrial he knows no limits . a young couple going on a trip to visit a professor of theirs , dr everett v. scott as a sort of celebration of their engagement have a car breakdown in the night in a fierce storm . they decide to knock at the door of the castle they see and they get into the et lab . after many incidents , detours and other adventures in this labyrinthine castle , they will both be initiated to sex by and with dr frank-n-furter . but dr everett v. scott arrives in a wheelchair and kind of saves the situation by explaining us and them what it is all about . at this time the main servants of the decide to go back to their planet transylvania leaving behind dr frank-n-furter dead but his creation rocky horror runs after his body and takes it away : he is in love with his maker and he is immune against the laser weapons of the ets . the three humans , dr everett v. scott , brad majors and janet weiss manage to get out of the castle before take off and end up the show in the mud . brad concludes that `` inside he is still bleeding '' , janet that `` the beast is still feeding '' , and the storyteller that `` on earth some insects call the human race lost in time , lost in space and the meaning . '' the show was not erotic but sexy . the film is the same sexy but not erotic . yet it is a comedy that plays on sexually ambiguous situations , on words tremendously and on all kinds of strange costumes , effects , , music . the proportion of music , singing and dancing is enormous . it is an entertaining story with a slightly titillating content . now the dvd , which is the film , made and still makes this play a success beyond the theatres where it was performed . apart from the opening wedding scene the whole film systematically keeps a distance from real cinema . it is not a play per se , far from it , but it is not a film either . it is somewhere in-between the two and that 's the interest of the film itself over the play . the first element that is obvious is the filming on location for outside scenes and when it is filmed in a studio the set is that of an extremely vast castle , at least that 's what they want us to believe and that vastness is emphasized by the long `` travelling '' of dr everett v. scott in his wheelchair to come to , or be brought to the laboratory . but there are some other scenes that amplify this vast dimension ; the action itself takes place in various rooms and these rooms are big and large enough to entertain a dancing body of twenty people or so . you can not get that effect on a stage . including several motorcycles and cars , one motorcycle in the main room of the castle too , running and smoking . the special effects are numerous and all add something to what a stage play would be . sound and visual effects create the storm and the suspense necessary for the evocation of fear and danger . but there are other special effects that are more subtle and less visible . yet without them many scenes would be flat . the main visible element in that line is the constantly changing camera shooting angle and probably camera too , and the editing that emphasizes this whirling effect by cutting and pasting small sequences one after the other of the same scene all from different angles . then you have a lot of smoke , artefacts of all sports , the apparition of a swimming pool where you had not seen it , the falling down of the radio tower of the rko radio picture logo when rocky horror and dr frank-n-furter try to climb on it to escape riff raff and his sister magenta , the et masters of the spacecraft . of course we must also think of the special effects needed to turn someone who is dressed into an entirely nude stone statue . that is both special effect and editing . and there are many instances present giving to the film a speed that it could not have on a stage and at the same time an intensity of action and that would also be difficult on the stage . finally along that line the use of tv screens to put people under surveillance is possible and frequent in the film because of the close-up shots on them that enable us to see what is on the screen , like for example brad being sexually served by dr frank-n-furter , which janet will eventually see on the screen , though after the act itself . the film enables us to see these moments which would have been awkward on the stage , or plainly invisible . the last remarkable element that the dvd and film provides is the storyteller , called in the credits the criminologist , in a private library in a completely different place and atmosphere . that trick is rarely used in films , certainly not that often , at least eight times in the present case . he explains and creates a perspective , which forces us to listen and think a little bit to understand the craziness of the situation . dr jacques coulardeau		10		1
after `` vertigo '' , director alfred hitchcock turns up the comedy , and tones down the subtlety , for this one . `` north by northwest '' is also the summation of a favorite , hitchcock plot : an ordinary man is mistakenly identified , falsely accused , and pursued by mysterious forces . the famous `` crop-dusting sequence '' is the peak of this , with wronged man cary grant -lrb- as roger o thornhill -rrb- helplessly attacked by an airplane ... in broad daylight ... as he waits at a bus stop ... in the middle of nowhere ... to meet a man who does n't exist . the only logical way to follow-up this line of suspense was with `` the birds '' ; therein , the attacker becomes the inhuman , thus more horrific , species of flying fowl . we innately know that , if birds were as big as crop-dusting airplanes , they would eat us . so , mr. grant is perhaps safer with a single plane than he would be against a flock of seagulls . the missing link in hitchcock 's chronological quartet is `` psycho '' , which followed `` north by northwest '' , and climaxes the director 's terror themes . and , at long last , sex is used like a . the marvelously funny script , by ernest lehman , received most of the attention , when it was time to give out 1959 movie awards . hitchcock 's direction , bernard herrmann 's musical score and george tomasini 's editing could n't be beat - but , they were . a trio of supporting players might have be noticed : eva marie saint -lrb- as eve kendall -rrb- , martin landau -lrb- as leonard -rrb- , and james mason -lrb- as phillip vandamm -rrb- seethe with forbidden sex . listen up for mr. landau 's scene-stealing `` call it my woman 's intuition '' line ; and , watch for ms. saint to seductively mouth `` i never make love on an empty stomach . '' naught , naughty . ********** north by northwest -lrb- -rrb- alfred hitchcock ~ cary grant , eva marie saint , martin landau , james mason		10		1
john `` scottie '' ferguson is a san francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague . whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend , gavin elster , asking him if he would n't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him . the job is simply to tail his wife because she 's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide , and the wife , madeline , is showing signs of herself being suicidal . ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses , ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde madeline . as the story twists and turns , ferguson 's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties ... vertigo is alfred hitchcock 's most discussed , dissected and critically reappraised film , based on a novel by pierre boileau called d'entre les morts , -lrb- also writer of diabolique -rrb- , vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright , the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print , and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made . what is most striking about vertigo , outside of hitchcock baring his innermost that is , is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified , but delving deeper , and repeat viewings are a necessity , its apparent that vertigo is a chilling force of cinema , taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions , perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being . very much a film of two great halves , vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery . once the prologue has introduced us to ferguson 's fear of heights , we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as ferguson tails the troubled madeline , the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings . then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to dante 's inferno and feverish dreams take control , hitchcock , as we have come to learn over the years , lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in , the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story . all of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking , the end to our own dizzying journey that alfred and his team have taken us on . technically the film is magnificent , the opening credits from saul bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold , while bernard herrmann 's score is as good as anything he ever did , unnerving one minute , romantic the next , a truly incredible score . hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw , introducing us to the brilliant camera technique to induce the feeling of vertigo itself , with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes . the two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work , james stewart as scottie ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past . kim novak as madeline is perhaps the quintessential hitchcock blonde , perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off stewart 's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill . it however should be noted that hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get novak right for the role , but the result proves that novak had ability that sadly was n't harnessed on too many other occasions . vertigo is a film that i myself was n't too taken with on my first viewing , it 's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go , it not only holds up on revisits , it also gets better with each subsequent viewing , it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible . not only one of the greatest american films ever made , one of the greatest films ever made ... period , so invest your soul in it , just the way that hitchcock himself so clearly did . 10/10		10		1
sam mendes ' tale of self-fulfilment is a masterpiece . everything works together in a wonderful harmony which is utterly memorable , gripping and beautiful to look at . it rings true , for the most part , because of two people , namely kevin spacey and annette bening . spacey is so sardonic , so world-weary and so precise with every word in every line that he makes every second spent with his character joyous , whilst bening brings a pitch-perfect portrayal of insecurity and suburban façade that frankly puts `` desperate housewives '' to shame . the entire ensemble gels together magnificently . but the film is not just made by the supreme acting but also by the fantastic dark comedy . the script , by alan ball , is hilarious in such a brilliantly inventive way , the likes of which have not been seen since billy wilder . and then there 's the visual style . mendes ' images are stunning , memorable and clever -lrb- plenty of thanks should also go to dp , conrad l. hall -rrb- . the direction is detectable but not overly forceful . you 're aware of the director 's hand but it does n't bother you and this makes you think . it absorbs you into the film completely . this is a wonderful experience and not to be missed . the simple message of the film is born out to perfection and the end is utterly satisfying , but along the way it is moving , funny , intelligent , stunning , devastating and uplifting . you must see this film .		10		1
since the dark knight rises is now out , i 'm going to give you my thoughts on the first two films in christopher nolan 's batman trilogy . so , this review for batman begins is going to be a really short one . a few days ago , i watched batman begins for the very first time on fx , and i thought it was an excellent beginning to nolan 's batman trilogy . it was well-written , well-executed , well-acted -lrb- christian bale is fantastic playing bruce wayne a.k.a. batman . -rrb- , well-paced , well-directed by christopher nolan , and pretty much everything about this -lrb- like the training sequences was very well put together . 10/10		10		1
the godfather is one of those movies i never get tired of watching , its a classic mob movie , francis ford coppola directed this gem with great acting by marlon brando , jimmy caan , al pacino , robert duvall , diane keaton , and john a violent , gritty and realistic account of a mafia family with marlon brando as don corleone , the big classic is often imitated but never story was written by mario puzo , from his best selling novel.it also stars ; talia shire , gianni russo , lee strasberg , john marley , alex rocco , and marianna an extremely long , a little over 3 hours , best seen was followed by 2 2 was very good , part 3 not so good.as an italian american i can appreciate the is one of a kind .10 out of 10 .		10		1
every time i sit down to revisit ghostbusters , and that 's not too often , sadly , i keep forgetting how incredible and richly funny this movie was . so much so , it should never be considered an adventure or supernatural action movie up front ; it should , by and far , be under the comedy section . and i 'm not just talking about the key and well-known shots as the funniest ones occur when there 's barely anything on screen but bill murray 's comic genius delivery . while i might have seen this in theatres -- i was only ten when released , i do n't recall . unfortunately , my family viewed very few films back in the early eighties and i did n't start my movie obsession until the late eighties . i know i caught it somewhere , sometime following the release and did like it , but never , ever appreciated it until i got older . i do n't think i was alone in that appreciation of this fantastic film . yes , the movie made a ton . sure , it was a bona fide summer blockbuster . but , i think people just expected such quality back then , they probably had no idea how influential , how deep the lines and comedy was or the impact . for , i see dozens of summer movies over the past and recent decade or so , that are strictly made for profit . made to be released , one after the next , while not caring it will fizzle after a couple of weeks to a month and then featured in a redbox a couple of months later . movies with very little heart inserted , too much cgi and less care taken . despite just `` being a comedy , '' ghostbusters was made correctly , down to the core . three paranormal at a university find themselves out on the street in new york just as their ghost theories become reality . hilariously gathering the funds to make it big in the big apple , they open the ghostbusters pest control business and take off ... eventually . one of their first clients is dana barrett -lrb- sigourney weaver , -rrb- a tough , but vulnerable broad who has an extra visitor in her refrigerator . while 1/3 ` buster at the time , peter -lrb- murray , -rrb- is more infatuated with her than her ghost fridge , they do follow up on her story while simultaneously capturing ghosts in the city and rise to fame . her storyline might be more of final clue for the upside in business for the ghostbusters and then things get real . above all else in this movie was the flawless performance from murray . while every single actor involved was also fantastic , namely harold ramis as egon and weaver 's dana , murray 's peter was pitch-perfect . his deadpan humor was so great , that i almost feel guilty for not appreciating dan aykroyd 's raymond role more , or rick moranis and annie potts in their third-tier , but important characters . do n't get me wrong ; on the whole , they all did great . i just could n't keep my focus much further than murray during this film . beyond murray and the wonderful supporting cast , was the infamous and beloved title song -lrb- ` in ' due to the countless times it was played , -rrb- a good score , special effects decent for the times and fairly good cinematography . this movie screamed what i love about summer blockbusters , but have n't seen in about two decades . sure , there have been plenty of great films ; fun and exciting and memorable films . but , rarely will i see one that 's more heart than just trying for the box office dollar . i miss these types of movies . well , i do n't have to any more . for , i bought this one on bluray and can revisit the `` good ole days '' any time i feel like it . recommended !		10		1
there 's something to be said about the strength of good , eerie , slowly - paced horror . especially in a day and age as we are now , where horror is misinterpreted by filmmakers as loud , lazy jump-scares , buckets of gore , and nubile girls running around in next-to-nothing , fleeing from deranged murderers . there 's something almost immediately admirable and exciting about a horror film that eschews these more modern -lrb- and decidedly not scary -rrb- tactics , and instead respects its audience , using atmosphere , a slowly building pace , subtlety and well-developed characters to draw us into a pervasive , overwhelming sense of dread . think about some horror classics : john carpenter 's `` halloween '' -lrb- or even more effectively , his remake `` the thing '' -rrb- , hitchcock 's `` psycho '' , peter medak 's `` the changeling '' , etc. . they all were respectful , subtle films that did n't rely on cheapness and laziness like so many other modern horror films . and i do believe that hideo nakata 's `` ringu '' -lrb- or `` ring '' -rrb- , a 1998 japanese horror film inspired by the novels of koji suzuki , belongs on a list with those classics . it is a powerful film for it 's quiet nature , subtle storytelling and well-developed characters , and they are what makes it so effective and frightening . -lrb- although tragically , it 's most recent sequel , `` sadako 3d '' does eschew the classic , subtle storytelling for a more messy modern affair ... more to come on that train-wreck in a later review . -rrb- we follow reiko asakawa -lrb- nanako matsushima -rrb- , a reporter who is investigating an increasingly popular urban legend regarding an alleged `` haunted video '' , which supposedly causes the death of all who see it . after probing the recent death of her niece , reiko decides to retrace their last few days , and discovers a mysterious video-tape in a cabin they had rented . realizing that the urban legend of the haunted tape is true , reiko and her ex husband -lrb- hiroyuki sanada -rrb- are forced to try and solve the mystery of who created it and how to stop it . the performances are fantastic . matsushima as our lead is brilliant and very well-developed , and is able to show both strength as well as draw the audience 's sympathy . -lrb- plus my piggish side does have to admit she is very easy on the eyes -rrb- sanada shows a lot of talent and intensity as , and he is able to balance well with matsushima with their good chemistry on-screen . and other performances , including rikiya as yoichi , the son of reiko and , are all very well-played and elevate the film quite a bit . it 's a phenomenal cast . nakata 's direction is quite a sight to behold . it 's very subtle , simplistic and direct , which actually makes it all the more unsettling . he does n't go out of his way to highlight the horror , or present the monsters with dramatic camera angles and musical stings - scenes are staged and shot simply , and it makes every feel very real . you get a sense that anything can happen at any time , causing non-stop dread later in the film . the script by hiroshi takahashi is fantastic , slowly building the tension and developing the characters over the 96 minute run-time in a way that puts many other films to shame , and makes us not only care about everyone , but have a very real , human fear for their safety . the rest of the production is fantastic and very true-to-life . the set design is great , giving us a world that feels like the same one we live in . costume design is simple , real and effective . the editing is top - notch , giving us a . and the musical score by kenji kawai is amazing . it 's very minimal , and only comes in when it 's needed , giving us an occasional spine-tingling violin shriek , or an eerie scraping of strings in the background . `` ringu '' is easily not only one of the best horror films to come out of japan in the past 20 years , but it 's easily one of the best horror films worldwide to be released in the past 20 years . and it 's cultural impact -lrb- so far four sequels in japan , an american remake and sequel , and countless other works inspired by it -rrb- is something to behold . i do believe that 50 years from now , it will still be looked at as a fantastic accomplishment in horror filmmaking . the only thing i do n't like about it is one particularly bad sound-effects choice that caused me to laugh out loud during a fairly crucial moment -lrb- a cartoonish sound that comes near the end and sticks out like a sore thumb -rrb- , but even that can not diminish the film in any way whatsoever . `` ringu '' gets a perfect 10 . if you have n't seen it , do yourself a favor ... get it , turn off the lights , and have a spooky time watching it !		10		1

i have to say that this film is quite difficult to watch sometimes . i believe jane fonda gave one of her best dramatic performances as a desperate woman . she earned an academy award nomination for her performance and it was worth it . her co-star michael sarrazin won an academy award for his role in `` west side story . '' i think this was a great performance that followed his success but he never went anywhere . i like watching bonnie bedelia as the pregnant dancer . i have to confess that the main reason that i rented this film was n't for any of the listed actors but for one of my all time favorite soap opera actresses , . i would give anything to see her act again whether it was a commercial or reading the phone book . she had a non-speaking role but her facial expressions was priceless . the dance telethon is cruel at times . the dancing goes on forever with breaks where the characters get to know each other a little better . the film also has gig young who i believe won an academy award for his role .		10		1
so , you would think as the third film , bruce getting a little bit older and the supposed ridiculousness of having a third bad day that die hard with a vengeance would be a terrible film , trying aimlessly to do something new with an old hat , that it would struggle . not at all . die hard with a vengeance is a superb third installment of the franchise and in being so good it cements itself as one of the best film franchises . the story here is excellent , mixing in thrills and spills with the usual plethora of humor that we 've come to expect as we watch mcclane pit his wits against the brother of hans gruber , simon . a stroke of genius is taking the die hard formula and applying it to the buddy cop genre as mcclane teams up with zeus , played fantastically by samuel l jackson . the initial hatred that turns to friendship is played out with great humor throughout , from the possible racist hate that they have to their arguing over the tasks simon sets them -lrb- the best being over the women in st ives and mcclanes ' curiosity over what they were doing -rrb- . the plot is more topical that one would expect -lrb- the first two becoming more topical as time went on -rrb- . the bombing plot appears to be ripped from the headlines , but the film is entertainment and as the film goes on we realize that simon , like his brother , is not a mere terrorist , but an exceptional thief , with the twist being that simon is after the gold of fort knox . mctiernan once again casts an english man in the villain role , with jeremy irons playing alan rickman 's brother . irons is great , although , like william sadler in die hard 2 , irons is in the shadow of rickman a tad , but he rises to the challenge enough playing a character of sheer genius and evil . being made at a time when action movies rely on special/visual effects and explosions , die hard with a vengeance is something unique , somewhat . yes there are plenty of spectacular action sequences -lrb- the train bombing and the central park trip being highlights -rrb- but mctiernan knows that these films rely on nice character development and humor as well as an entertaining plot to make the film work and that is what we get here . there are some interesting twists to the narrative and the chemistry between willis and jackson is great . if the fourth film ever gets made they should bring back zeus as this could put the franchise into a new gear . the buddy element works fantastically as the bickering and bantering between the two characters makes the film so much fun to watch . i love these films and the third one is terrific . of course there are many debates over which of the sequels are the best , but i believe that they are both great . the third one ensures that this will remain a classic series and i hope that the fourth one -lrb- if it gets made that is -rrb- will retain the integrity of this entertaining and fun series .		10		1

the best and only spider movie for men . this film is the final word on spiders . frank marshall did a terrific job ! the spider photography is really creepy , so if you 're very scared of them , i suggest you press the fast forward on your remote . plot : a never yet encountered venezuelan spider bites photographer jerry manley -lrb- played by mark l. taylor -rrb- during an expedition to the venezuelan rain forest . the jerry immediately dies from the spider venom . his body is packed in a makeshift wooden coffin . the spider which has gone unnoticed creeps into the coffin , which travels back to the u.s. to jerry 's hometown of canaima . ross jennings -lrb- played by jeff daniels -rrb- is a family physician , who has moved to the small town of canaima from san francisco , and faces a lack of patients due to elderly rival sam metcalf -lrb- henry jones -rrb- , who was supposed to retire and shift his patients to ross . the venezuelan spider mates with a domestic house spider and makes a nest in jennings 's barn , producing hundreds of infertile , but deadly , offspring which can kill a fully grown man with a single bite . so now these smaller spiders move out of barn and are ready to attack anything that gets in their way ... notable actors : jeff daniels -lrb- dumb and dumber , , speed -rrb- gives a superb performance as usual . julian sands -lrb- the loss of sexual innocence , warlock , a room with a view -rrb- gives an average impression as the entomologist dr. james atherton . as does john goodman -lrb- sea of love , barton fink , the big lebowski -rrb- who plays the pest exterminator delbert mcclintock . i do n't know why he was chosen when you could have had dwight schultz or brad douriff for the role of delbert and the role of james atherton could have gone to sean connery , roger moore of michael caine . yet again proof of poor casting in hollywood . its jeff daniels that keeps the movie going and he is given very little support form the rest of the cast . if the quality of the acting had been raised or with a veteran cast , this would have been an even better film . special effects are excellent . no complaints in that department . why not go and buy the film ? its the best film that features spiders attacking people . and an excellent viewing on you home cinema ! thanks for reading . email me vivekmaru45@yahoo.com for more movie suggestions .		10		1
in every sense of the word , the day the earth stood still is timeless : the message is eternal , the film-making flawless -lrb- as a whole , the `` goofs '' listed here on the imdb notwithstanding -rrb- . in terms of entertainment value alone , the day the earth stood still overshadows most of what came before and most of what has come since . it 's one of those must-see movies that no serious fan of the genre -lrb- or of superior movie-making in general -rrb- can pass up . michael rennie set the standard for extraterrestrial emissaries -lrb- and may very well have inspired the stoic spock on star trek -rrb- and robert wise raised the bar for thoughtful science fiction films . -lrb- although , of late , we 've seen a sad degeneration to video-game stupid `` sci-fi , '' the day the earth stood still proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the genre was a viable vehicle for the dissemination of speculative ideas . -rrb- there are n't very many movies regardless of genre that can stack up against the day the earth stood still . it remains a timeless masterpiece .		10		1
a film from finland is always welcome as there are no so many ways of appreciating this country of around everybody can not afford to travel to finland in order to know what goes there , it is better to watch a film from such a choice is made it is better to watch a film made by kaurismaki brothers aki and mika , who have been hailed globally as finland 's unofficial cultural ambassadors . `` mies '' is a film about the troubles of an ordinary man who is left to fend for himself after being beaten by this film aki kaurismaki has continued his passion of portraying underdogs as his genuine sympathies are for to a shocking survey some nouveaux riches people of finland raised their objections about this film by stating that it does not represent finnish realities as their country is not like a poor would really be nice if these people could somehow be induced to appreciate this film 's humor which is not at all slapstick and comes through observation of daily good film is hardly devoid of a sensible film 's message is clear and is better to forget one 's bad memories and not know anything rather then trying to pretend to know everybody .		10		1
` for your eyes only ' is the forgotten movie of the roger moore bond era . kevin mcclory had threatened to bring sean connery out of retirement for a proposed remake of ` thunderball ' which , he promised , would revert to the tougher style of the earlier films of the series . cubby broccoli was so worried that not only did he accede to moore 's massive pay demands , but delivered a pre-emptive strike with this movie , the first bond of the ' 80 's . ` eyes ' eschews the sci-fi nonsense and juvenile humour of ` moonraker ' in favour of a more realistic espionage story . a british spy ship - the - has been accidentally sunk off the coast of greece , aboard is a transmitter known as a.t.a.c. should it fall into the wrong hands , it could conceivably enable the russians to order our own submarines to attack us . 007 is dispatched to the south of france to find cuban hit-man hector gonzales -lrb- stefan kalipha -rrb- , killer of british agent timothy havelock -lrb- jack hedley -rrb- and his wife -lrb- toby robins -rrb- . bond is not the only party interested in gonzales ; the ' fiery daughter melina -lrb- carole bouquet -rrb- is after him too , and has a fondness for crossbows ... by 1981 , broccoli had run out of fleming books , so michael and richard maibaum combined a pair of short stories from the ` for your eyes only ' anthology , linked by the a.t.a.c. plot . the bond movies had steered away from politics in the past , but here the cold war was featured for the first time . i regret that this happened . it made the ' 80 's bonds more dated than those of the ' 60 's . moore was reportedly unhappy with the ` toughening ' of his character , particularly bond 's killing of ` locque ' -lrb- the late michael gothard -rrb- . but it remains one of his finest performances in the role . a major innovation was the concealment of the villain 's identity for much of the picture . it looks as though its going to be greek smuggler columbo -lrb- topol -rrb- but no , its ari kristatos -lrb- after years of menacing ` john steed ' and ` simon templar ' , julian glover had graduated to 007 . he gives a splendid performance here -rrb- . this was the first bond to be directed by john glen , who like peter hunt before him , started on the series as an editor / second-unit director . ` eyes ' has , at times , the look and feel of one of the i.t.c. shows he worked on in the ' 60 's , such as ` danger man ' and ` man in a suitcase ' . it is certainly not short on action ; the pre-credit sequence in which bond is trapped in a helicopter over london by blofeld is wonderfully cheeky , the car chase in france fabulous , ditto the ski scene in which bond is pursued by a motorbike , and the underwater fight . rick sylvester doubled moore for the breathtaking mountaineering scenes . among the fine supporting cast , lynn-holly johnson 's ice-skating nymphet ` bibi dahl ' made more of an impression on yours truly than carole bouquet 's ` melina ' . as bernard lee had died , james villiers was drafted in to play the ` chief of staff ' - his only appearance in the role . a young charles dance can be spotted as one of the bad-guys . a couple of things i did not like - during the car chase , bond 's pursuers draw level and -lrb- wait for it -rrb- he gives them a friendly wave ! what was stopping them from shooting him ? the film climaxes with a run-of-the-mill punch-up in a monastery . as climaxes go , it is definitely anti . worse , the final scene features janet brown impersonating margaret thatcher . it was funny at the time , but looks horribly embarrassing now . sheena easton 's title song - though not one of my favourites - was a worldwide hit . though some were disappointed to not find richard kiel 's ` jaws ' in the picture , ` eyes ' was a blockbuster . in the u.k. , it was the second most popular film on release in 1981 -lrb- the first being ` superman 2 ' -rrb- , putting it well out in front of spielberg 's ` raiders of the lost ark ' -lrb- it came eighth -rrb- . bond had just entered his third cinematic decade in style .		10		1
when i heard david lynch was directing a disney movie i cracked up , but when i saw the straight story i realized that it was probably his best . i am a big lynch fan and if you are n't familiar he is the man behind such macabre and disturbing films as : lost highway , blue velvet , the elephant man , and the t.v series twin peaks . i would n't think that resume would put him at the top of the list for a disney movie . the straight story is about a 74 year old man who upon learning that his brother who he had n't spoken to in years , had been stricken with a stroke travels 400 miles to see him . because he does n't have a drivers license he sets out on his riding lawn mower . the film is packed with beautiful scenery of iowa and stellar performances by sissy spacek and richard farnsworth who was nominated for an ocsar for his performance as allen straight . that along with lynch 's direction , a wonder score by angelo badalamenti , and a heart-warming script sends not only allen straight on an emotion journey , but the viewer as well . the film is about family and the strength there of . you may want to call a loved one after you see the straight story so keep the phone and a box of tissues close . the straight story will touch you in a way no other film has .		10		1
out of the entire trilogy , this one is probably the best of the bunch , but then again the first one usually is . our hero , affable archeologist adventurer and nazi slayer indiana jones -lrb- harrison ford in the role that will no doubt be what he 's best remembered for when he 's gone -rrb- joins forces with old flame marion -lrb- karen allen -rrb- and cairo based digger pal sallah -lrb- john rhys-davies -rrb- in a race to get the lost ark of the covenant before the nazis get it . chaos and mayhem ensues . after a slightly boring 20 minute gap from the opening to the first shoot out in the snow bound bar , this is a fairly well paced adventure that pits you against spiders , ghosts , the atlantic ocean , and pat roach . parents be advised though : some of this is not for kids .		10		1
twenty-five years have passed since i last saw this film . i remember my fascination with this snotty boy who skipped school , showed disdain for authority , and made a general nuisance of himself . those questions are still there but the answers are a little easier . truffaut did n't go for the over-dramatic . he showed the day to day activities of a person who felt disconnected from a goal or place in life . he has disdain for his parents though they are n't all that horrible . his mother is sleeping around and he knows it . his father is an ineffectual boob who is terribly in love with the woman who really does n't have any respect for him . they treat the boy ok . when they are angry with him they are probably justified . he is getting a good education and he is `` betraying '' them . there are great scenes on the streets . the weird attempt to steal and then return a typewriter is priceless and sets the young man in another direction . also , the reform school scenes are quite striking . the sad thing about this is that the boy is running but where is he running ? that 's the question we must keep in mind .		10		1
`` the jungle book '' encompasses everything that i always wanted to see in an old hand-drawn animated film by walt disney . i saw many of disney 's masterpieces in my childhood , and now recently , i have begun to start watching them again several years since i last saw them . take `` the jungle book '' for instance . it was one of my favorite disney movies in my childhood , and yet i had n't seen it in years until just a few moments ago . and now that i 'm older and know more about the movie , i appreciate it and enjoy it even more than i believe i ever did as a kid . first off , there is the absolute amazing animation done by disney 's studio . if i 'm not mistaken , they were still using hand-drawn animation when they made `` the jungle book '' and if my guess is correct , it was masterful . it 's amazing that artists could be so talented , so precise , and yet so creative at the same time to make things look so vivid and realistic . and they also bring depth and characterization to their 2-dimensional characters with only a script to base their work off . all of the characters in `` the jungle book '' are amazingly created and fitted into the story , adapted with talented actors to perform the voices . and disney used authenticity with several voices . the voice of mowgli was performed by an actor of about the same age as the character . the other voices of the bagheera , the baloo , sinister and even more so comical kaa , and then shere khan , one of the most memorable disney villains of all . george sanders provided a perfect , purring and cold-hearted voice for the character , ultimately increasing the effect of the tiger to make up for his lack of screen time . lines such as `` you 're trying my patience '' and `` you should know that everyone runs from shere khan '' always make me think in my mind : this was perfect ! after shere khan , my favorite character is kaa the python with the hypnotic gaze . and he 's not a frightening villain , but a funny one and therefore , a lovable villain . there is one minor flaw in `` the jungle book '' which i find in a lot other disney movies . everything it this film is perfect , except for the fact that its running length is just not equal to its entertainment . in other words , it 's about ten or twenty minutes too short . but i suppose this is justifiable for its age . movies at its time were n't all that long and hand-drawn movies take a long time to put together because of the hand-drawn animation . yet , this did not impact my enjoyment on the film as i watched it . the bottom line for this review is that `` the jungle book '' is one of the finest , if not the finest , of all of walt disney 's films . it 's too bad he did n't live long enough to see this one go to theaters and see the audiences cherish and love it .		10		1
as meryl streep has long been known for serious roles - some of them a bit sappy - it was great to see her play the bitchy lead in `` the devil wears prada '' . anne hathaway plays a young woman who moves to new york and gets a job working at streep 's fashion magazine , only to find that streep lives an entire existence based on schadenfreude -lrb- she 's only happy if everyone else is on pins and needles -rrb- , wants the most impossible things -lrb- e.g. , the unpublished harry potter manuscript -rrb- and that the people in the fashion industry are too full of themselves for their own good -lrb- they act like they 're curing cancer -rrb- . unless she can do something to rock the boat . i think that streep had some of the funniest lines that i 've heard in a long time , namely her whole monologue about cerulean . it goes to show how ridiculous these people in the upper echelons really are , but i also like some of the stuff -lrb- oops , `` stuff '' is a forbidden word in fashion ! -rrb- that hathaway pulls . like `` '' and `` zoolander '' , this movie leaves nothing unscathed . you got ta love it as much as i did . it certainly deserved its oscar nominations . so yes , do n't bore me with your ... questions . also starring stanley tucci , emily blunt and simon baker .		10		1
in the insider , russell crowe once again proves his versatility as an actor . it 's amazing how different he looks in this film from his other roles , particularly mystery , alaska and gladiator . here , he plays the part of jeffrey wigand , a man who is torn between his responsibility to uphold his agreement to keep his mouth shut about happenings with a gigantic tobacco company and his duty to inform the public of potentially harmful products . he was fired from his position as the head of research and development , and as he gingerly begins to speak to lowell bergman -lrb- al pacino -rrb- , a spokesman from 60 minutes , he begins receiving death threats aimed at himself and his family . crowe delivers yet another outstanding performance , as does al pacino , who flawlessly creates the type of character that his role calls for . not only is this a very interesting story , but it also gives a very good look at how big business corporations work , with both the massive cigarette companies as well as the respected television show , 60 minutes , being presented in a new light . the casting was perfect for this film , everyone delivered excellent performances . the legal thriller is an almost endlessly interesting genre , but the insider puts a new twist on the almost overdone subject , resulting in an excellent film that should not be missed .		10		1
`` the burning '' -lrb- 1981 , tony maylam -rrb- is a typical `` friday the 13th '' knock-off . a camp gardener named cropsy gets accidentally burned to a crisp by some pranksters , survives and comes for revenge on totally innocent teens with garden film features creepy keyboard music by rick wakeman -lrb- yes -rrb- and gruesome gore effects made by maestro tom acting is rubbish , but overlook that and you have a scary , little chiller from the golden era of slasher for the killings , they 're all most unpleasant of all involves a young girl having her throat slashed with garden , and there is also the infamous raft massacre , when cropsy slaughters five teenagers in a single sequence.the dialogue is completely ridiculous -lrb- `` this guy is burned so bad , he 's f *** ing big ! '' -rrb- , but the film is quite eerie at sum up , `` the burning '' is a fine example of just how good a low budget production can be and is by far the best movie that tony maylam has done to you can get hold a copy of this film , i would recommend it 's not a classic by any means , just solid slasher it in the dark and enjoy the gore .		10		1
lee daniels pulls no punches and does n't let anything get in his way of delivering a brilliantly heartbreaking story , based on the novel `` push '' by ramona `` sapphire '' lofton . the title character , claireece `` precious '' jones , embarks on many social issues throughout her tragic story , including : hiv/aids , , illiteracy and teen pregnancy . amateur gabourey sidibe won the role at an audition she randomly decided to attend , but there could n't possibly have been a better person to have been cast . one of film 's greatest debut performances . mo ` nique and paula patton should also be noted for their greatest performances of their careers so far . **** -lrb- out of four -rrb-		10		1
a most surprising approach of mid-life love for a mother and wife , though seen by a male director apparently well supported or supplemented by some women in the team . what happens if for four days you are alone , but not abandoned , and meet a man that reveals to you that there can be some new love in your life even though this life of yours is satisfied , happy , well-balanced and characterized by no particular need nor want , nor even , as for that , wish , except maybe the desire to listen to and enjoy some classical music , some opera singing -- and it could be anything at all -- which is not appreciated by the other members of the family ? that is rather light as for discontentment or dissatisfaction . a short-lived love affair develops during and over these four days and you are confronted to the need to make a decision . the situation has already been considered by many and in many films . you break off and away and let yourself go with that love affair . then later on you regret what you have lost in the process . or you resist and do not yield and you regret all your life what you have not done . in both case you enjoy what you have taken or kept and you are divided between the two sides of your decision : does what i have taken or kept balance what i have rejected , refused or let go ? the film is thus not particularly innovative by its theme . yet it has a special perfume , fragrance . what is it ? certainly not the reaction of the children when they learn about it after your death . their reactions are predictable and even superficial . the special value of this film is in fact in the two actors and the way they embody , with their body acting , the meeting of two potentials , the passion and the end of it , the loss of it and yet the survival of it . apart from this marvelously well rendered flesh of the film the subject is banal . meryl streep particularly transcends her part and takes us into the deepest layers of her mind the way they ripple on her surface , on the surface of her body and behavior . we feel her disarray at first , her fascination then and her conservative sacrifice last in the most humane and subtle way . we are suffering and rejoicing with her and each side of her situation or decision has its lot of suffering and its lot of rejoicing . that 's why this film should be kept in mind and remembered . dr jacques coulardeau , university of paris dauphine & university of paris 1 pantheon sorbonne		10		1
okay , without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies . michael douglas comes off as presidential , annette benning is spectacular , martin sheen is exceptional , and the supporting cast is marvelous . and this is all directed by rob reiner , the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge , power and presence required to make a first class film . of particular note are david paymer , michael j. fox , and anna deavere smith , all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film . paymer is the perfect foil to fox , and anna balances them perfectly , giving a unity to the staff presence in the film . perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of ` normal ' events in the white house during the romance . we are not excluded or merely `` clued in '' , but we participate in all the activities of the president , which makes the film more realistic and visceral . the flow of the film is exceptional , since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us , and the cinematography is amazing . the sets are perfect . rated pg-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity , this film is far from offensive in its delivery , its demeanor , or its presentation . a classic which will enhance any collection .		10		1
when viewing the film , one is simultaneously drawn into a story which is both realistic and at the same time surrealistic . the movie was also shot in glorious b & w , which only enhances its impact on its audience . the screenplay is from the william golding novel , which was quite popular in this period , 1962 to be exact . i can remember that it was one of the books which we had as required reading during our junior year at my high school . ditto for a lit class of mine at the city college of chicago about three years later . the film opens with a montage of credits which are both stressful to the viewer , but also tell of story 's beginning . without giving away anything , a fairly large number of young , upper class british school boys are marooned on a tropical island following an evacuation for a nuclear war threat . they are left to their own devices and we observe their reactions . other than the opening and closing credits , the film is masterfully put together in such a way as the viewer really feels that he is watching real events unfolding before his eyes .		10		1
two years , ago sam raimi brought spiderman to the screen in spectacular fashion . of all the come book super heroes romping around on the big screen since then , some have managed to be good , a few have struggled to be just okay , and some have reeked of super doo doo . absolutely none of these wannabes such as the hulk , hellboy , or daredevil , have come close to matching the success of raimi 's spiderman . for all their razzle dazzle cgi special effects , none of the writers and directors of those films seemed to be able to grasp the fact that when all is said and done , it 's still the story , the characters , and the human drama that counts . peter parker could be the guy next door , your best friend down the street , your cousin , your nephew or even me . he is just an ordinary guy , who has been blessed with powers that he did n't ask for , and much of the time would just as soon not be burdened with the responsibilities and anguish that comes as part of the deal . so after almost two years and two full months since we last saw spiderman , the question remains as to whether or not raimi can recapture the magic . the answer is that he not only recaptures it , he harvests it , weaves it , and packages it in a film that surpasses the original in every way imaginable . this film surpasses the first one in so many aspects that i almost feel compelled to go back and lower the a grade i bestowed upon that one . that was then , however , and this is now , and this is as good as it gets . from the time the opening credits hit the screen you know there 's something special in store . raimi does a recap by using comic book paintings to recapture important details of the original film . i ca n't remember any film where i wanted it to start over again just so i could soak in the opening sequence . the artwork is done by an artist named alex ross , and this is the first time i felt it necessary to give acclaim to someone about film credits , but he deserves it . as for peter parker things are n't going too well . he still carries a torch for mary jane who has a new boyfriend , his best friend harry osborn is obsessed with avenging his father 's death , his late night hours fighting crime as spiderman are causing him to flunk his college courses , he 's always late for work delivering pizzas , and his mother is in such bad financial straits that the bank may foreclose on her home . it 's enough to make a guy want to give up the ghost , or failing that his spiderman costume . worst of all , as his personal life begins to weigh heavily on peter parker , his spiderman powers seem to be diminishing , sometimes failing him altogether at the worst possible moment . in order to keep from failing one of his classes , peter is doing a paper on dr. otto octavious whom is experimenting with fusion as a viable energy source . eventually harry , who is financing the dr. 's experiments , takes peter to meet him and shortly thereafter with scientists and the press in attendance , dr. octavius begins his experiment . in order to handle the material needed to carry out the experiment , dr. octavious has huge tentacles connected to his body . when the experiment goes awry , the tentacles permanently fuse to his body and develop a will of their own , while controlling his mind and turning him into doc ock . just as in the first spiderman , we have another villain that is in some ways a lot like peter parker . like spiderman , norman osborne was changed into the green goblin , not because he wanted to be but because of an overzealousness in perfecting scientific experiments . norman may not have been the best person on earth , but he was far from being evil . the same can be said of dr. octavius . he is a good scientist working to better things for mankind , but just as norman osborne found out , you better make sure you know exactly what you 're doing . both of these are perfect examples of what makes a good villain . in a way , we can almost sympathize with their misfortune much in the same we sympathize with the dilemma of everyday life wearing on peter parker . why other films such as hellboy find it necessary to give us villains who come from incomprehensible mumble jumbo hooey phooey is something i 'll never understand . spiderman does n't require us to take a notepad and pencil along with us so we can map a convoluted plot that we have to spend so much time figuring out that by the time we do we 've lost interest in the film the characters and everything else . there was a time when tobey maguire was almost replaced by jake gyllenhaal for the sequel . i do n't know how gyllenhaal would have done and frankly , i 'm glad we did n't have the chance to find out . maguire is able to portray the burdens he faces as peter parker without falling into the trap of overplaying the role with so much angst that we lose our identity with him . as he worships mary jane from afar , we feel the love , we feel the pain , but not too much that the film becomes weighed down by it . to not have toby as spiderman , they should just as well put george clooney in the role . both james franco as harry and kirsten dunst as mary jane manage to bring even more depth to their characters . harry is still tortured by the fact that he never seemed able to live up to his father 's expectations . the experiments of dr. octavius are crucial for him to be able to lift that burden because if successful , he will have surpassed anything his father had accomplished . when the experiment fails , the only driving force left in his soul is his desire for revenge against spiderman whom he mistakenly holds responsible for his father 's death . mary jane has become a model and an actress . she is now independent and self-assured , and despite the fact that she may love peter , she is determined to move on with her life . let 's not forget rosemary harris as aunt may . unlike the first film , she is given much more to do here . she has some great scenes , some funny moments , and some very touching ones . whereas the first film explored in depth the relationship between peter and his uncle ben , we get more in depth story between peter and his aunt here . she is not in this film just to bake cakes and pat peter on the head . as for the special effects , what can i say except that in every way they surpass anything you 've seen before . the arms of dr. octavius wave around as if they have a mind of their own . when spiderman goes to battle with him , it makes the confrontations between spidey and the green goblin pale by comparison . there is an amazing battle in a bank , and an even more fantastic one aboard an elevated train . not to mention that we find out what it 's like to be spiderman and try to deliver pizzas as a superhero . some found the special effects in the first film flawed . i was not one of them but just the same , they are done with such precision and expertise here , flowing seamlessly between cgi and live action . you wo n't know the difference . you 'll also be happy to know that raimi does an excellent job in wrapping up this episode , yet is able to already begin setting up spiderman 3 in the process . it 's a perfect example how to just wet your appetite for the next one , yet leave you completely satisfied with the conclusion at hand . for all the special effects , all the battles , and all the scenes of spiderman flying around the manhattan skyscrapers , without the human elements the film would be just another special effects extravaganza we would forget about as soon we walk out of the theater . raimi understands this better than anybody else . so does maguire and the rest of the cast . it 's the burdens , the conflicts , and the passion that spiderman carries inside himself that lift him so far above any of the other super heroes . that 's what has made these films truly something special . it has been years since i felt compelled to pay money to see a film twice in a theater . the last time i did was probably for one of the original star wars films . i think i 'll be seeing spiderman in a theater for a second time , and that 's the highest recommendation i can think of . and if i 'm going to the theater for a second time you can damn well bet i have no choice but to give spiderman 2 an unqualified , resounding , a + .		10		1
the most astonishing thing about this movie , other than the assurance of its direction and the fine performances by all of the players , is its modernity . ford is not presenting a jingoistic , ultra-patriotic , flag-waving view of war . instead he is commenting on the ironies , and the human waste , of warfare . at the time , ford was even criticized for making a film about defeat , rather than victory . his point was precisely that with the early sacrifices of defeat , ultimate victory is impossible . ford portrays warfare realistically and without the sentimentality that too often mars even his best work . it is also interesting for donna reed 's performance , one of the few times in his early or middle periods that ford portrays a self-assured , modern woman who is neither a madonna nor a whore .		10		1
within the heart and mind of the true poet resides a grasp and perception of life and the human condition unequaled in it 's purity by any other art form . from rimbaud to frost to jim morrison , he will in a few words or lines create or recreate an experience , thereby enabling his audience to know that experience , as well , albeit vicariously . the poet , of course , will choose the medium through which he will share his vision . for director david lean , that medium is the cinema ; and with ` doctor zhivago , ' a film of sweeping and poetic grandeur , he reveals that within , he harbors the heart and soul of the poet . indisputably , this is the true nature of david lean ; and it is evident in every frame of this film from the beginning to end . to borrow a line from the more recent ` moulin rouge , ' this is a story bout ` love . ' a love story set against the backdrop of the russian revolution . dr. yuri zhivago -lrb- omar sharif -rrb- is a general practitioner , but he is also a poet ; through his vocation as a man of medicine , he tends to those in need in everyday real life . but it is through his avocation as a poet that he expresses what he sees . he marries tonya -lrb- geraldine chaplin -rrb- and has children ; but the war and revolution intervene , and it is during these tumultuous times that his life becomes inexorably intertwined with a government official , komarovsky -lrb- rod steiger -rrb- , a young revolutionary , pasha -lrb- tom courtenay -rrb- , his half-brother , yevgraf -lrb- alec guinness -rrb- , and finally , lara -lrb- julie christie -rrb- . it 's desperate times for russians from all walks of life , and zhivago does what he can to do what he can to keep the fragile threads of his life -- and of those around him -- intact . but fate plays a hand , and in the end , even zhivago must go where destiny leads . with ` zhivago , ' david lean has crafted and delivered a magnificent and monumental motion picture of epic proportions that at the same time is disarmingly intimate , rendered as a world within a world , with each a vital part of the other . lean blends actors , cinematography , story and music with his own compassionate perspective to create a true work of art ; a work of true poetry . in telling his story , he offers breathtaking visuals , like the awesome vistas of the snow-covered urals , or a long shot of a wide open russian plain with a solitary figure in the distance trudging through the snow , juxtaposed against the enormity of the landscape . often , however , what he does n't show you , but suggests , is even more effective and emotionally stirring . consider the scene in which a complement of mounted , sabres drawn , ride down upon a crowd peacefully demonstrating in the city streets ; lean sets it up so that you understand what is about to happen , then trains his camera on zhivago , watching from a balcony overlooking the street as the carnage unfolds below . and in zhivago 's eyes , in the expression on his face , in his reaction to what he is witnessing , there is more horror because of what lean has established in your imagination -- and which significantly enhances the impact of it -- than anything the most graphic visual depiction could have produced . similarly , when the czar and his whole family are shot , lean does not take you there ; instead , you learn of it and realize the impact of it through the reaction of alexander gromeko -lrb- ralph richardson -rrb- , tonya 's father , and it places it into a context that makes it all the more effective . this is filmmaking at it 's best , and an example of what makes lean 's films so memorable . put a talented actor into the hands of a gifted director , and results of more than some distinction can be expected ; and such is the case with omar sharif and david lean . in 1962 , sharif received a best supporting actor nomination for his work in lean 's ` lawrence of arabia , ' and in ` zhivago , ' lean 's next film , sharif gives a sensitive , affecting performance for which he should have received a best actor nomination , but inexplicably , did not -lrb- it was lee marvin 's year for ` cat ballou ' -rrb- . still , as yuri zhivago , he has never been better . sharif successfully manages to convey his deepest , internalized emotions , expressing them through the genuine compassion with which he imbues his character . lean allows his star the time he needs to share with his audience his appreciation of the beauty he perceives in the world around him , and it 's in those pensive moments that we , in turn , perceive the inner beauty and poetic nature of the man . you have but to look into zhivago 's eyes to know his sense of joy in all living things . it 's a wonderful collaboration between actor and director that so vividly and poignantly brings this character to life . 1965 was a career year for julie christie ; she received the oscar for best actress for her work in ` darling , ' yet in this film created an even more enduring and memorable character in lara -lrb- aided in no small part by the hauntingly lovely ` lara 's theme , ' by maurice jarre , which indelibly etched in the consciousness of ` zhivago 's vast , international audience -rrb- . lara 's beauty is obvious , yet of a kind that goes much deeper than what you see on the surface ; her station in life has made her vulnerable to misuse , but at the same time has endowed her with a strength born of necessity . and zhivago sees in her a quality and a resourcefulness that fulfills his romantic notions of perfection , and with a beguiling screen presence and a performance to match , christie makes those notions credible and believable . guinness , richardson and courtenay are exceptional in their respective roles -- lean without question knows how to get the best out of his actors -- and also turning in noteworthy performances are siobhan mckenna -lrb- anna -rrb- , rita tushingham -lrb- the girl -rrb- and klaus kinski , who is unforgettable as , manacled and designated for forced labor , yet the ` man on this train ! ' one of lean 's greatest films . 10/10 .		10		1
max ophuls shows just how glorious melodrama can be in the dream-like letter from an unknown woman . adapting an interesting yet ultimately just average novella , ophuls proved he was a master of film-making by turning the finished product into an unforgettable film . memories of letter will forever be burned into your mind after just one viewing . joan fontaine gives one of her best performances as the hopelessly romantic young lisa , who begins a lifelong passion for a pianist -lrb- louis jordan , in perhaps his best american role -rrb- as 14 year-old girl , when he lives near her quarters . the film is told in flashback , as jordan reads fontaine 's letter from beyond the grave -lrb- the classic line `` by the time you read this , i may be be dead ... '' originates from this excellent film -rrb- . fontaine 's obsession for the handsome , yet indifferent playboy knows no limit , and she spends years silently admiring from afar , spending one passionate night with him which produces an illegitimate son , and meeting up with him again , after she has married , in the hope he will remember her love . but he does n't remember . not until the very end , at least . this film epitomises doomed , tragic romance ... but , oh , is n't it a glorious ride ! the much-lauded train sequence , obviously fake , sums up the film almost entirely , and lisa 's earnest belief in her love , despite all signs pointing the other way . she is a woman who would sacrifice her own son , and eventually her life , for this man 's love , and fontaine 's acting is so powerful and haunting that we believe lisa all the way , and never once doubt her . ophuls focuses on the myths and ideals of romantic passion , stripping away the facade of self-sacrifice being the ultimate romantic gesture . lisa spends her whole life loving from afar , idolising someone who does n't return her love ... and yet , playboy reveals quite a similar pattern of masochism . he indulges in many woman , his indifference never allowing him to experience real love , just as lisa 's idolatry and wish to be the woman who never asks stefan for anything , never lets her experience true happiness . stefan is looking for a goddess ; lisa looks upon him as a god . then there is ophuls ' direction - his trademark swooping camera and meticulous attention to detail , symbols and structure render letter a brilliant work . superb .		10		1
lester burnham , kevin spacey -lrb- the usual suspects , midnight in the garden of good and evil -rrb- and carolyn burnham , annette bening -lrb- the american president -rrb- have a terrible relationship , a marriage `` made in hell . '' as a result the family is completely dysfunctional . all the characters have something weird about them . the society they live in is imperfect , they live in a very imperfect world and the imaginative use of all the neuroses make it a great and suspenseful script , an oscar winner . the actors were nominated for and spacey won an oscar . american beauty also won best director , best picture , and best cinematography oscars . i say it deserved them . it mirrors society extremely well . carolyn burnham represents the materialistic society we live in . she puts more value into her couch than she does to her husband . i found it interesting that all the furniture and scenes carry a lot of minimalism and simplicity . there is in contrast much going on with the characters . an instant classic , sam mendes ' american beauty , to me parallels robert redford 's ordinary people . outside everything is beautiful and perfect but inside it is viciously ugly , full of lust and sin . that simplicity and the primary colors such a the red door , made me pay closer attention to the dialogues . i found the young adult neighbor weird as far as been a peeping tom , but had a unique sense of beauty . i recommend this movie ! favorite scenes : the blowing autumn leaves , the red petals , the contrasting colors . the movie is a feast for the eyes . well deserved best cinematography . favorite quote : carolyn burnham : `` this is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in italian silk . it is not just a couch . '' lester burnham : '' it 's just a couch ! ''		10		1
`` memento '' is the most original , fascinating , expertly crafted piece of film-making that i may have ever seen . i was absolutely blown away by the sheer brilliance of the concept and the execution . what an amazing piece of writing and filming . to take a preposterous , and often overdone concept -lrb- witness all the amnesia flicks of the 50 's & 60 's -rrb- , and from that , craft something that can only be described as amazing , is a feat of raw genius rarely seen on screen in this day and age . this film must be required watching for not only all film school students but any student of literature or even english composition 101 . very impressive , very entertaining , very remarkable . 10 out of 10 barky		10		1
scorsese 's epic true story about how the mafia build vegas , is as close to a perfect movie as i have ever seen ! the story is just so good and you will be hard pressed to ever find a better pair of performances than the ones by robert de niro and joe pesci . i love this film , i loved it the first time i saw it , and i loved it the hundredth time i saw it . casino follows a pair of gangsters who earned their reputations in las vegas in two very different ways . de niro is ace rothstein , the man with the plan . he always made money , but since he was jewish , he was never fully trusted . pesci is of course , nicky santoro , the tough guy who says the f word seven thousand times , while doing things his own way . everything about this movie is pure genius . it 's on my top ten list and i suspect will always have its place .		10		1
after 5 years from die hard part 2 , which did n't do as good as the first , willis makes a strong comeback the 2nd best movie in the trilogy . i did n't care too much for the second one , but the first and third are action classics , if you can classify any action flicks as classic . die hard : with a vengeance stars bruce willis -lrb- unbreakable , the sixth sense -rrb- , samuel jackson -lrb- pulp fiction , the negotiator -rrb- and jeremy irons -lrb- dungeons & dragons , the time machine -rrb- in this epic action flick of the decade . if you are looking for some of the best action of the 1990 's , then look no further . this movie has what you crave for . explosions , guns , car chases , jumps from bridges , helicopters , even a scene in the mean streets of harlem , in which bruce willis is forced to wear a picket sign with suggestive material written on it . bruce and samuel jackson have the greatest chemistry together and make this film work and fit together like a puzzle . it has plenty of spills , thrills , laughs , action , wit , great acting , what more could one ask for ? i highly recommend this movie . 4 * 's out of 4 * 's for the action scenes alone .		10		1
mississippi burning -lrb- 1988 -rrb- number 1 - 1988 top 15 - 1980s top 100 - all time 1964 . when america was at war with itself . few other films are as powerful , meaningful and profoundly unsettling yet simultaneously intense and action packed as alan parker 's mississippi burning . to say that this film is good would be an understatement . there are two ways this film can be seen - firstly this is a first rate police thriller , superbly shot , it delivers maximum impact . secondly , and most importantly in my opinion , this film is a sumptuous documentation of extreme racism in the deep south in the 1960s . the declaration of independence states that `` all men are created equal '' . this ai n't true in mississippi . this film is harrowing , it is not easy to watch and at times it is simply emotionally overwhelming . this is one piece of cinema which displays the mindless and infinite callousness and savagery that is possessed by humanity . what makes us so hateful ? this film does not investigate such complex issues , it rather shows its devastating effects . the murder of 3 civil rights activists in mississippi in 1964 , attracts external police forces -lrb- mainly the fbi -rrb- to investigate the disappearance of these 3 young people -lrb- 2 white , 1 black -rrb- . head of operation is mr. ward , played with a commanding and controlled brilliance by willem dafoe and accompanied by gene hackman . now here is the thing with hackman , he is one of the greatest screen actors of our time . his presence transcends beyond the screen , whenever he is on the screen he steals the show . few other actors are as magnetic as hackman , especially when we see him get angry . this is an excellent achievement , with an outstanding cast , including frances mcdormand in a superb performance . when you see this film , ask yourself one question . where does all this hatred come from ? essential viewing 10/10		10		1
harold -lrb- bud cort -rrb- is in his 20s . he 's always depressed , has no friends and , for fun , attends funerals . at one he meets maude -lrb- ruth gordon -rrb- who 's almost 80 . she loves life and she brings harold out of his shell . they quickly fall in love . a deserved cult film . this -lrb- understandably -rrb- bombed as a mainstream movie -lrb- it was considered too dark -rrb- but was a big hit when it started playing the midnight movie circuit in the 1970s . this is very 70s in terms of style , music -lrb- cat stevens -rrb- and its general laid-back attitude but it still works wonderfully . i never found cort that good -lrb- he 's too blank-faced -rrb- but gordon brings the movie to life . she sparks every scene she 's in -- she seems to be having a whale of a time in her role . she 's helped by a wonderful script that has some of the best observations on life that i 've ever heard . my favorite is , `` everybody 's allowed to make an a ** out of themselves once in their life '' . the movie is very quiet and laid-back and the black humor -lrb- which is actually pretty mild -rrb- may turn off some viewers . still i love this movie ! i 've seen it multiple times and never get tired of it . a 10 all the way . also the dates harold 's mother sets up for him are hilarious !		10		1
`` casablanca '' may have the most quoted lines in film history , but `` the maltese falcon '' , pound for pound , or i should say scene for scene , has the snappiest banter and greatest one liners of any film i 've ever viewed . most of them come from private detective sam spade -lrb- humphrey bogart -rrb- , and the tighter the fix , the more clever they are . my personal favorite is `` how 'd i kill him , i forget ? '' , when polhaus and -lrb- ward bond and barton maclane -rrb- interrogate spade about the death of his partner . in fact , if you 're not paying attention , a lot will sail completely over your head , so it 's best to watch the film distraction free and with a scorecard to keep track of the players . the cast is a colorful lot , populated by both good guys and bad guys -lrb- and gals -rrb- . mary astor turns up early , and with more than one identity before spade pins her down as one brigid o'shaughnessy . she 's on the trail of a fortune disguised as a pawn shop rarity , a black bird rumored to be the fabled maltese falcon . hot on her heels are kasper gutman -lrb- sydney greenstreet -rrb- , in league with a sinister joel cairo -lrb- peter lorre -rrb- , and a hot headed gunsel named wilmer cook -lrb- elisha cook jr. -rrb- . each is a dangerous character , but spade sizes them up appropriately . of wilmer - `` the cheaper the crook , the gaudier the patter . '' have you ever heard a better description of a crook too big for his britches ? understated though her role may be , spade 's assistant and gal friday is a sheer delight ; effie perrine -lrb- lee patrick -rrb- appears to have been around the block a few times , and could be a worthy gumshoe herself . note how she describes iva archer 's belongings on the night her husband died , with an eye for detail and a sense of mystery . sam knows he has an able assistant there , makes you wonder why he has n't made a move on her himself , though he 'd already compromised himself with his partner 's wife . that 's why it comes as somewhat of a surprise at film 's end when bogie 's character comes through it all lily white , willing to throw brigid over in the name of fair play and standing up for one 's murdered partner - `` do n't be too sure i 'm as crooked as i 'm supposed to be '' . he 'd already served up all the suspects to polhaus in as neat a bundle as the real one , the black statuette , which turns out to have been a stand in for the real thing . it 's still out there somewhere , casting it 's lure for another gang like gutman and company . wondering aloud what the `` dingus '' sitting on spade 's table is , his reply to the detectives sums up what the film 's three murders can only hint at - `` the , uh , stuff that dreams are made of '' .		10		1
first off , i 'll say that i saw michael keaton and george clooney as batman , and i remember the tv show . in reading some of the reviews posted here , i realize that i missed a lot of batman over the years . apparently this franchise went way wrong -lrb- uh , did it start with the clooney version ? -rrb- , and people were nervous about seeing this one . all i know about the batman cartoon is that his parents were killed leaving the movies after having seen `` the mark of zorro . '' not a warner brothers movie , so you can forget that . this film purports to tell the story of how bruce wayne became batman . i 'm not sure how much it sticks to the cartoon batman , but it 's terrific just the same . bruce -lrb- christian bale -rrb- struggles with his anger and bitterness over the death of his parents . he becomes involved with the league of shadows , a group with a very extreme mission , where he learns a lot of survival techniques . wayne finally settles on trying to do some good for the broken down , crime-ridden , gotham - especially when he learns that the league of shadows plans to annihilate it . no expense was spared either for the cast or the effects , and there are some amazing ones . the casting is inspired : the handsome bale is a perfect bruce/batman , who manages to hold his emotions inside ; michael caine as alfred the butler - fabulous casting , and one really sees the bond alfred and bruce ; the brilliant tom wilkinson as the evil carmine falcone ; liam neeson as an instructor in the league of shadows ; morgan freeman as lucius fox , who works for wayne 's company , which is in danger of being stolen from bruce . the only for me was the casting of katie holmes as an assistant district attorney . she came off like a high school student . age-wise , as a childhood friend of wayne 's , she 's in the right age range , but holmes seems much younger than her years . this is a dark , brooding film that combines the effects with human drama . really a great film .		10		1
blow out runs with an idea and makes it work . brian de palma uses the idea from blowup -lrb- obsession over one real-time element involving murder -rrb- , and it into his usual , dependable form of the suspense picture . he finds the right cast to take it through as well . this script could be taken in the wrong hands and made into lessor material , perhaps . but often it 's not even the script that is as grabbing -lrb- though it does , being de palma in his prime , have its share of wit and sweetly honest moments -rrb- as is the direction . this is a filmmaker very much in trusting with a specific storytelling style that suits the nature of the subject matter . you 've got a protagonist thrust into a deceptive , shadowy kind of element , and because its a star in that role propelling it - alongside some ` choice ' villains , it 's never too unbelievable in its own sort of world . john travolta -lrb- in a role displaying a little more of his range than usual -rrb- is a sound recorder for low-budget horror movies , and going over a particular crash into a river one night by a curious couple of subjects , the audio drives him into an obsession . but the story does n't dwell fervently into it like blowup did -lrb- then again only antonioni , or maybe coppola with his the , could make it that deep into it -rrb- , and in a way it does n't need to . with nancy allen , a cute , talented actress , there 's the other part of the story to drive it forth , as she plays the passenger in the car who may or may not know more than she 'll tell , even to her rescuer travolta . then along the way we meet some shady people including dennis franz and john lithgow 's characters -lrb- the latter especially , in a role un-like him but made all the more compelling for it -rrb- . it leads to a climax that is one of de palma 's best as well . blow out does n't kid its main audience , and thats where it finds its strengths . it 's in a realm of the psychological , but it does n't steep itself too much to become more of an experimental film like de palma 's earlier films . it also lacks some of the weaker qualities that have come in some of his later films -lrb- i.e. a good deal of plausibility or lack of caring about the characters -rrb- . it at times shows its gritty side -lrb- i.e. franz 's scenes -rrb- , and it also includes some great scenes between travolta and allen . simply put , it 's a well-done movie .		10		1
this was an excellent movie that would appeal to people of all ages . it is about a young man who goes back in time by accident and ends up in 1955 . he ends up screwing with time and has to do several things to fix his mistakes . it is a great movie for older people because of the fifties theme . it 's a great movie for teenagers due to the teenage factors in it and it 's a great movie for action lovers because of the action sequences . plus , it 's a great movie for those who love science fiction . at the end , it 's an edge of your seat , heart stopping thrill ride that i sure enjoyed . put your hands on this movie and push play because you sure will love what the future will bring .		10		1
airplane ! hit america like a ton of bricks when it was released in 1980 . filmgoers had been traumatized throughout the 1970s in burning buildings -lrb- towering inferno -rrb- , underwater -lrb- the poseidon adventure -rrb- , at sea -lrb- jaws , orca -rrb- , and in the air -lrb- airport ! , airport ' 75 , and airport ' 79 -rrb- , and had just about had it with the disaster films . then came airplane ! , which rose from the ashes of disaster like a phoenix to define a genre that now includes so many movies that the original merely blends in , to those who do n't realize how innovative and groundbreaking it was . plot ? yeah , there 's one : disgraced vietnam veteran and ptsd sufferer ted striker -lrb- robert hayes -rrb- chases his ex-girlfriend , elaine -lrb- julie hagerty -rrb- onto the flight where she is a stewardess in order to convince her not to break up with him . sure enough , the plane encounters trouble due to food poisoning of anyone who ate fish . ted is the only one who can save the day , and will presumably win elaine 's heart back if he does . the only problem is that the last time ted had to save lives by flying a plane , six people died ... no , seven ! the plot is not what carries this film , of course . it is merely used as a delivery device for rapid-fire satire of everything from american society to air travel , our pretentiousness , and the ridiculous plots of the disaster films it parodies . overnight , leslie neilsen went from a moderately known veteran actor to an a-list comedy star , and he is cashing in as much now as then on the reputation he built in that film . the deadpanning and are liberally dispensed , and juxtapose brilliantly against the absurd backdrops that keep working their way into the film . a friend of mine said she did n't see what the fuss was about this film , and all i could do was call her by name and say `` shirley , you ca n't be serious . '' a must-watch and a must-own . one of the most brilliant films ever made . the number of successful films of this genre which would not exist were it not for airplane ! is staggering .		10		1
i ca n't believe what i saw . neither will you . this movie defines creepy . the pile of rocks . the children crying . the house . this is actually making me cry . i 'll admit it . this is the scariest thing ever put on film . i 'm never going in some place with bushes around me . i will never forget this movie . it stays with you for a few days . your scared to even go somewhere in your house at night . this is snuff . all the acting . the settings . everything is so real . i guess that 's why it 's scarey . halloween used to be my favorite horror movie . not anymore . i just ca n't believe it . it 's so real . i think it should at least nominated for best picture . if you do n't think so than see it . everyone who saw this had to have been very scared . those who were n't are liars . there 's nothing in the world that will make you this scared . the plot is simple . three teens go into the woods to make a movie . never seen again . we see what happens to them . if you do n't like to be scared than do n't see it . but it 's the best horror movie ever made . the blair witch project : a +		10		1
the 7th voyage of sinbad is arguably ray harryhausen finest achievement , it is a fantastic family treat from start to finish . nathan juran 's direction is realised with dazzling spectacle , that is further advantaged by beautiful cinematography -lrb- particularly of baghdad and -rrb- and very convincing effects . i absolutely loved the clever designs of the monsters , such as the cyclops and the dragon , both of which are quite scary , the two-headed bird , and my favourite the warrior skeleton . bernard hermann 's magnificently rousing score gives some weight to the really exciting scenes , and there are so many of them i ca n't count . the always likable kerwin matthews is very handsome and charming as sinbad , even if he is n't the typical sinbad from the other films or the stories . kathryn grant is beautiful beyond words as princess , and the evil magician sokurah is marvellously played by indian actor torin thatcher . richard eyer is very sweet as the genie , though my only minor complaint of this brilliant movie , is that the genie 's electrified voice got a little distracting . but overall , it is a hugely enjoyable film , with a 10/10 . bethany cox .		10		1
1974 was the year of brooks because not only did he deliver us `` blazing saddles '' but this masterpiece as well . this is the third and sadly the last collaboration between brooks and wilder and both go all out in this picture . this is the type of picture where you laugh from beginning to end . and what 's great and original about this movie is that mel brooks does n't direct a spoof of frankenstein but instead the comedic version . **** out of **** stars a masterpiece !!!! a little side note : while this movie got an oscar nomination for best screenplay , i feel that it should have gotten more . for instance best picture , best director , best actor , and best original score and i believe it should have won for best director , actor , and screenplay . another side note : as an aspiring filmmaker i have found a lot of inspiration from this movie . the way that mel brooks made a comedic version instead of a spoof really fascinated and inspired me . thank you , mr. brooks		10		1
kiki , a 13-year-old restless , spontaneous , brave , and kind girl is witch-in-training . she follows the traditions of her craft that require her to fly away using a broom as the means of transportation from her loving family and friends on a yearlong journey to complete her apprenticeship . she will need to find a place where no one knows her and to support herself while becoming a full-fledged witch - just like her mother did when she was 13 . it 's a charming as well as highly entertaining story of self-discovery , taking responsibilities , becoming independent and mature , and following and achieving one 's dreams . the film is -lrb- i will not be original and just repeat what countless reviews have said already -rrb- breathtakingly beautiful . i 've been watching movies all my life , and i 've seen thousands but rarely have i wanted to stay and live in the imaginative movie 's world . hayao miyazaki 's kind and magical , lovely and sweet without being sappy or patronizing animation made me dream of the place like . i did not want to leave the romantic magic seaside town that kiki and her ironic talking black cat jiji chose to stay , where everyone -lrb- well , almost -rrb- seems to respect , like , and to help to one another , where kiki established reliable `` witch express delivery '' using her flying skills and where `` the things are sometimes difficult but she is fine '' . yes , i wanted to stay in the dreamy sparkling world that hayao miyazaki created by the gentle power of his incomparable talent . i want to join millions of grateful viewers and to thank walt disney company for having introduced the films of hayao miyazaki to the rest of the world . they are invaluable treasure and will be enjoyed equally by the adults and the children . i also appreciate the choice disney company provided releasing on the same disk the dubbed version and the original japanese one with the english subtitles .		10		1
the informant ! -lrb- the exclamation point is part of the title , even though i am very excited about it -rrb- . a film based on true events . it stars matt damon as mark whitacre , an executive at adm , one of the world 's largest agricultural conglomerates , and in regards of the film , one of the front runners in corn processing technologies . whitacre lives a good life with his family in illinois . we being when trouble starts at the plant and an employee is suspected of trading secrets and sabotage . the fbi is brought in to investigate with the help of whitacre , who is being treated like the company guinea pig . when he and his wife ca n't stand it , he confesses . the real damage that is going on with the company is with price fixing . whitacre agrees to assist the fbi after seeing no other way out of it . he becomes an informer . after being somewhat reluctant to proceed , whitacre goes all out with his new fixation . he records conversations , stages meetings , and collects evidence to build a case with the bureau on adm. damon holds nothing back for this role . aside from the physical changes damon went through , you can tell just by the simple lines of dialogue that every word is important and that he is trying to speak through the character and not as an actor . his supporting cast does a fantastic job , especially fbi agents shepard and herndon played by scott bakula and joel mchale . damon is surrounded by several faces from comedy from both this era and previous institutions of comedy . comedians like tom papa , patton oswalt , tom and dick smothers , and paul f. tompkins . knowing that these people were comedians playing fairly dramatic roles took some of the drama out and made it a little funnier . papa did an excellent job as one of adm executives . where the film really takes off is off screen . the voice overs by damon 's character add so much humor and levity to the story . in between scenes where whitacre is walking , driving , or any time there is little action to take notice of , we here whitacre giving some speech about something almost completely irrelevant , but still timely and very amusing . there is truly never a dull moment . soderbergh does a fantastic job filming here . he uses a great mixture of colors and tones that reek of the 90s , especially in the office buildings and hotels . he captures the right feeling for each scene . as we see that whitacre is slowly being consumed by the case , we can tell without even being told . soderbergh is very good at presenting the right mood for a film . it does n't hurt to have an amazing soundtrack by marvin hamlisch , who has done scores for all different types of films like the sting , bananas , ordinary people , and the spy who loved me . the score is over the top , but so is the story . it fits perfectly with what is going on in the movie . i especially enjoy the scenes of damon walking through the adm office . the music is like a combination of a jazz club , game show , and an elevator . i know it 's early , but i have high hopes that this one will get recognized by the academy . there is n't anything of major concern that is wrong with the film . damon for sure should get recognized here . he never gets a ton of praise for his acting , although he is very popular and successful . here is a breakthrough performance for someone who has already broken through . for soderbergh , it 's just another victory for this incredible filmmaker .		10		1
seconds is a constantly disorienting experience and an edgy , daring film for its time . it unravels from the first moment with strange , ominous image after image after image . it bookends by first blurring , stretching , compressing and the image of an eye , eventually becoming lucid to begin the story and then blurring the film 's final shot into the same pattern of disorientation , as if the movie were all a dream or a stream of subconscious thought . nearly every shot is filmed with very rare and radical technique or from a spying perspective . deep-focus and angles galore , and at times what we see on screen changes in our minds without changing physically before it transitions . sometimes considered a third in a `` paranoia trilogy '' of movies directed by john frankenheimer made close together in the very paranoid mid-1960s -lrb- the other two being the cold war thrillers the manchurian candidate and seven days in may -rrb- , seconds however prioritizes delving into the psychological dimensions of alienation over the sociopolitical conditions of the other two , as well as that it is distinguished from the other two as a science fiction story . but it does n't tell us that by brandishing strange technologies or creatures , or any special effects at all , or anything remotely overt in the sci-fi regard . it is purely based on what the main character is told , and what he believes and thus what we believe . frankenheimer 's knack for capturing the complicating nature of social situations while still delving into the psychology of his characters is a rare and unique skill . a middle-aged man has grown distant with his wife . his only daughter is married and virtually out of his life . even his work , which was the centerpiece of his life , has become tedious . a bizarre call from a friend he thought was dead beckons him to a certain place . the boredom and relative apathy bred in american suburbia is handled as a bleak , illusory inner monologue . there is no profound metaphysical epiphany , any authentic one anyway , but the feeling of going to the doctor 's with dread , then finding out you 're in great shape , only to learn later that more tests need to be done , then that you may go broke waiting to be reimbursed by your insurance company . as a rule , would n't you sedate someone before wheeling them into an operating room to kill them , instead of having some employee just tell them to chill then gag them while having a priest recite last rites ? unless it would deprive a fine actor of an effectively disturbing scene , of course . and that 's precisely what it is , so i let it go . the entire film is subversively designed to get under one 's skin . be absorbed by cinematographer james wong howe 's hand-held work in certain scenes , mainly two parties that are so riskily visceral and carefully haphazard , in how he infuses that coarse , naturalistic texture of the '60s and '70s with the more calculated , detailed compositions of cinematic surgeons like hitchcock and lang . the fearful score . and the sound , particularly that of a faint drill , is horrifically pacifying .		10		1
new zealand screenwriter , producer and director jane campion 's third feature film which she wrote , is a new co-production which was shot on various locations in new zealand . it premiered in competition at the 46th cannes film festival in 1993 and was produced by australian producer jan chapman . it tells the story about ada mcgrath , a mute and talented pianist and her daughter flora who once upon a time in the 1850s moves from nelson , australia to new zealand with her adolescent daughter flora where they are to start a new life with ada 's predetermined husband , a landowner named alistair stewart . after arriving at a beach with their belongings and ada 's precious piano they meet their future companion , but a conflict arises when ada learns that she has to leave her piano behind . distinctly and acutely directed by new zealand filmmaker jane campion , this mysterious , erotic , exquisite and imaginative period drama triangle which is mostly seen from the main character 's point of view and narrated through her wordless though definite expressions , draws an intimate portrayal of a woman 's affectionate relationship with her piano and her afflicting strive for independence while being captured in an arranged marriage . while notable for it 's mythical milieu depictions , majestic cinematography by english-born new zealand cinematographer stuart dryburgh , production design by new zealand production designer andrew mcalpine and costume design by australian costume designer and production designer janet patterson , this lyrical , romantic , invariably moving and poignantly atmospheric fairytale about the complexities within a relationship between two men and a woman , depicts a versatile study of character . this rhythmic and character-driven mid-19th century fictional tale is impelled and reinforced by it 's cogent narrative structure , british composer michael nyman 's sterling score which in a profound way conveys the protagonist 's passionate and conflicting inner life , jane campion 's emphatic screenplay and the exceedingly compassionate and memorable acting performances by american actress holly hunter , american actor harvey keitel , northern new zealand actor sam neill and canadian-born new zealand actress anna paquin in her debut feature film role . a heartrending love-story and a visionary masterpiece which gained , among numerous other awards , the palme d'or and the award for best actress holly hunter at the 46th cannes film festival in 1993 , the academy award for best actress holly hunter , best supporting actress anna paquin and best original screenplay jane campion at the 66th academy awards in 1993 .		10		1
i was impressed at the original aliens . there is no words to describe how much better this film is . everything is nearly perfect with this film especially the aliens and the horror scenes . to see this movie , i recommend that you watch the the 1979 version first because the plot is a direct continuation of that movie . in aliens , ripley has been in hypersleep for 57 years . she is upset that her daughter is gone and even more because no one believes her tale . but , the company sends her with marines to figure out what happened to the colonists on the original planet ripley was on 57 years before . the plot and the characters will keep you in suspense . the acting is top-notch . almost every actor gave excellent performances . signourey weaver still is powerful playing ripley . i was impressed with carrie henn as she plays a girl that survived the alien attacks on the colonists . bill paxton was decent even if he was a bit whiny . the special effects and the action are great . the explosions are -lrb- only for that time period -rrb- . the visual effects are stunning . the action scenes are fun to watch . there is more action than the first film because we see that ripley can kick some serious butt . the music by james horner adds spice to the movie . overall , this is a perfect sci-fi/horror film . i rate this movie 10/10 .		10		1
the first time i saw house on haunted hill i was a kid and it scared me . vincent price is outstanding as an eccentric millionaire who invites some people to stay overnight in a haunted house , who ever stays for the duration of a night would be rewarded $ 10,000 , theres ghosts and all kinds of creepy goings on for the guests that include ; richard long , carolyn craig , herbert marshall , and elisha cook starring the very beautiful carol ohmart -lrb- spider baby -rrb- the dvd of house on haunted hill is very easy to find , and very cheap about as low as 1 recommend this movie to all vincent price fans and fans of classic horror , the great william castle -lrb- the tingler , macabre -rrb- directed .10 out of 10 .		10		1
this may well be seagal 's best movie . very tight and fast-paced drama with plenty of action , some of it shocking . seagal is a cop out to find his childhood friend - turned hoodlum . he executed seagal 's partner and is leading other gangsters in a random , murderous crime spree through the streets of brooklyn . nobody can `` clean out '' a bar like seagal can . what sets him apart from van damm , etc. ; is his ability to convey rage and his habit of cussing out his opponents as he trashes them . lots of brooklyn mafioso and assorted lowlifes are portrayed with chilling realism . william forsythe is thoroughly believable as richie , the psycho . seagal is lean and mean in this one and he takes no prisoners . he 's actually a very good actor and he proves it here .		10		1
somewhere in mexico , two bounty hunters meet a bar 's piano player named bennie , a cheerful and easy-going dude -lrb- some drops of tequila helping -rrb- played by the late warren oates . robert webber 's character asks him if he knows about a ` hombre ' named alfredo garcia . meanwhile , a prostitute puts her hand on his crotch and gets a severe kick in the head . no doubt , this is a sam peckinpah film . yet if `` bring me the head of alfredo garcia '' features all the archetypes that cemented the legend of the ultimate hollywood rebel through its cinematic orgy of booze , flesh and bullets , the sinful quest carries a much deeper meaning through its converging point : the head of alfredo garcia . the owner of the deadly grail was a ladies ' man who had one woman too many when he impregnated the daughter of a rich mexican plantation owner -lrb- general from `` the wild bunch '' -rrb- . whoever brings ` el jefe ' the head of garcia would be rewarded 1 million dollars . the bounty hunter is a recurrent figure in peckinpah films as the quest for money is generally the mark of the antagonistic side . the gig young 's character leaves a name for bennie : ` fred c. dobbs ' , much more than a tribute to `` the treasure of sierra madre '' , it 's also a pessimistic premonition echoing the demise of bogart 's legendary character . and peckinpah 's films , of the same as hustons ' , obey to the same sense of immanent justice ; all the people motivated by lust or greed get punished , while killing for a matter of honor and revenge generally belongs to the central protagonist . and it 's only fitting that bennie 's love interest is ileta , a prostitute , played by isela vega , crystallizing the violent symbiosis of lust and greed : a cocktail beyond redemption . she ` knew ' alfredo garcia and reveals that after three days they spent together , he died in a car - crash . bennie expresses an ironic sadness as if garcia finally paid for his sins and had no reasons to be loathed anymore . garcia 's head was the unlikely symbol of his redemption before becoming the instrument of bennie 's revenge . bennie accepts the bounty hunter 's contract for 10,000 dollars . yet bennie strikes as a man who 'd be no more motivated by money than bloody sam was for awards or peers ' recognition . warren oates 's droopy eyes , hidden in the same glasses that peckinpah used to wear , betray the hypnotic exhaustion of a totally ravaged soul , torn between a profound desire to be happy and a sort of lucidity governing his actions , as if he was sure that he would never get his break . bennie desperately tries to reach an oasis of happiness after a life full of torments . no matter what it is , he carries guilt like his conscience 's eternal hangover . but the film features a very tender and relieving moment of true love between bennie and ileta , during a picnic , set in a nice bucolic garden . bennie wants to move to some place , one he does n't know . apparently , whatever he left behind him left him with sore feelings . and then , there 's a heart-breaking exchange when she asks him if he ever thought of marrying her . oates is too genuine not to be sincere , he 's trying to come up with the most honest answer : he thought of it but never asked . `` then ask me '' , she says and those are the truest words of any woman in love . bennie starts crying as if he was the closest ever to his own vision of happiness , realizing that maybe things could change for the best . he asks her , and she breaks down crying . she 's a prostitute and never thought she could ever find a man who 'd love her . these are cries of joy from people who 're not used to happiness , each one being the key to the other 's redemption . this touching and human moment is ruined by the arrival of two bikers and the rape attempt on ileta , not a gratuitous display of misogyny but a pivotal scene . the scene is ambiguous because kris kristoferson starts as a sexual predator and then gets with ileta when she ` gives ' herself . the bikers -lrb- who sinned by lust -rrb- are killed but the experience proved bennie that his woman is still a prostitute because she played their game , did n't scream or shouted for help , and he 's still the same schmuck . later , he tells ileta his plan to desecrate garcia 's grave , she 's against it , but this time it 's for the money . and bennie would pay his move the biggest price , and the death of ileta annihilates every possibility of redemption . and under this divine justice , sam , and garcia 's ghost are parts of the same trinity , tempted by the worst aspects of human nature and struggling to resist to them because they are not bad guys . bennie is convinced that garcia , whose putrid head is packed in a bag with flies buzzing around , would have forgiven him to make money out of his head , just like bennie forgives him for ileta . it 's not a parallel between money and women , but a way to look of them as elements of happiness . but there 's a time in a man 's life where he finally sees the true value of things and that no reward , no bounty , not 10,000 not even one million dollars , can buy a man 's soul . at the end , like for `` the wild bunch '' , the true redemption comes up when the man decides to live his life on his own terms . so , call it modern western , campy b-movies , a bizarre mess , an autobiographical essay ; the film is beyond any label . but if you take movies as the greatest art form when it comes to convey human emotions , `` bring me the head of alfredo garcia '' is a masterpiece . like a true author , peckinpah really opens his soul to the audience and to appreciate this film is to understand him and to respect his legacy .		10		1
carol reed 's post-war thriller was filmed in 1949 , but since then there have n't been a half dozen movies as intelligent or exciting -lrb- or amusing , or romantic , etc. etc -rrb- . among its many virtues are : graham greene 's tightly plotted web of deceit and corruption ; a vivid setting in the -lrb- genuine -rrb- rubble of war-torn vienna ; a superlative , perfectly balanced cast ; moody and evocative black and white photography ; and several memorable set pieces -lrb- the ferris wheel confrontation , the chase through the sewers -rrb- . capping it all off , and setting the perfect tone , is the famous solo zither score by anton karas , forever calling to mind the rueful smile of orson welles as black-marketeer harry lime , caught unaware in a darkened doorway by a stray light from a nearby window . from beginning to end the film is a masterful blend of old world romanticism and post-war cynicism , with the former represented by naïve american pulp fiction writer holly martins -lrb- joseph cotton -rrb- and the latter by the cheerful , dangerous lime -lrb- trevor howard 's impeccable major calloway is the realist between them -rrb- . the more image of alida valli departing harry lime 's -lrb- second -rrb- burial leaves a final , indelible impression , marking the film as a rare , true classic that actually improves with every viewing .		10		1
first , ordinary people should have made afi top 100 hundreds films of the last century . this film has excellent performances by timothy hutton , mary tyler moore , donald sutherland , judd hirsch , elizabeth mcgovern and dinah manoff . the story could have been another movie of the week but it stands out from the rest with subtle brilliant heartwarming performances during a family 's difficult time . timothy hutton plays the role of the son with such depth and brilliance . besides the tragedy , the film is about a family who are just ordinary people . ordinary people who are just as complicated and troubled by life 's hand . the fact that robert redford directed this film makes it even more worth watching . he does a fabulous job with the actors and actresses in this film . you will forget judd from his taxi role and mary tyler moore from her television days . this film is worth watching even on we .		10		1
a film that surprises me every time i see it . this will constantly be one of my favorite films as it is a constant barrage of hits . the film perfectly matches screwball comedy , raunchy romance -lrb- without ever getting too sexy -rrb- , action , and mysterious suspense . a trick in recent films is to confuse the audience until the very end , where needless exposition happens . hitchcock was a master of mysteries because he knew how many unanswered questions to have on the go at any one time , and when to answer them . as the film progresses , new plot twists arrive , making it an interesting and intriguing film . at the beginning , we are as clueless as grant , but as the film goes on , we see more and more , gradually making us more informed than grant . this clever respect for the audience means we are never talked down to . the action scenes are as fantastic today as they ever were . the slow build up to the plane scene is the kind of patience lacking in today 's shaky cam world . north by northwest is a perfect movie .		10		1
one of the most charming fantasies ever put on film was what gary ross did in the film pleasantville . it 's subtle message about tolerance for diversity ought to be required viewing for those of us who make public policy and influence public opinion . television of the fifties seems to have fashioned an image of the american family that permeates our political views and social mores right down to today . not that families were any better or worse during the fifties , but the image that television created with families from ozzie and harriet , leave it to beaver , father knows best , right through to the brady bunch seem to set impossible standards . including a favorite of mine , the donna reed show which i believe was the model for the parker family in pleasantville . starting with your 's truly , i do n't know anyone who had an upbringing like in a tv family . tobey maguire and reese witherspoon play a pair of current teens who do n't have the greatest of home lives . maguire is a nerdy kid and witherspoon is a very serious version of kelly bundy who thinks if she sleeps around , she 'll be popular and has n't much interest in education . one night while witherspoon is running late for a date and maguire is getting ready for a marathon showing of the popular fifties family comedy pleasantville the remote breaks down . as if by magic , a tv repairman played by don knotts shows up with a very special remote . as witherspoon and maguire fight over the remote by magic they are transported into the television set and become part of the self contained universe of pleasantville . oh , and they are in black and white as the show was taped back in the day . so with their new identities from the teenage kids of the parker family with ideal mom and dad joan allen and william h. macy , maguire and witherspoon seek to adjust to a new life in television land . but just the introduction of these two into this well ordered universe changes things , first in the most subtle ways and then as both realize the problems with this world in more direct ways . as the change comes , color comes slowly creeping into the black and white images . pleasantville got oscar nominations for art & set design , original score , and costume design unfortunately not winning any . however it won saturn awards for tobey maguire and joan allen for best actor and supporting actress in a science fiction film . i prefer to think of it as a fantasy rather than a science fiction film , though i can see that science fiction certainly influenced the creation . it combines the best elements of a star trek tng pair of episodes involving data and with a holodeck character based on professor moriarty and how he 's dealt with and an original episode involving kirk and spock and some of the rest of the crew landing on a planet where the philosophy of a former sage named landru is enforced vigorously . there 's a bit of the stepford wives here as well . in fact in the role of the head of the pleasantville men 's association is j.t. walsh in a farewell performance . such things that do n't fit his ideas and those of an influential few are just not permitted in their paradise . pleasantville is also the last big screen appearance of don knotts , an interesting choice for the tv repairman as he was a regular on the most wholesome andy griffith show . pleasantville is one of the best films of the last decade of the last century . it illustrates that humanity 's real strength is in its diversity and how we respect that diversity . it 's what brings out the best in the human character , in the human spirit .		10		1
hands down , i loved this movie better than any one that i have seen this year . i saw it before it came out for the first time . i went in like everybody else , not knowing what it was about . i laughed until i cried from being so with audacity . it was funnier than anything i saw , including south park , election , and go . it was a brave new movie that challenged how all movies were made , in general . all of the actors and actresses in this movie seemed to know what jonze was going for . they all acted psychotic and unbelievable in a movie that was psychotic and unbelievable . there is absolutely no realism to this movie , nor does it ever attempt to be a realistic movie . from the surreal intro to the creepy ending , this movie never strayed from way out of left field . it stayed its course , and everybody who hates this be damned . i really would love to spill the beans about everything in this movie , it is so wonderful ... but i ca n't . i ca n't even give away any basic plot points . i went in blind and appreciated it all the more for going in blind that i do it now with all of my movies . i will go in blind , except knowing about performances or genres . i almost started this paragraph spilling plot points that are basic , but i deleted them . go in and be surprised . however , i can not recommend this movie to everybody . this is a brash movie that will shock and offend some in ways that they have not imagined . it is a black comedy , darker than most . however , there is no death in this movie . it takes its humor from better , more intellectual sources than that . but , it is dark , and most will hate the movie for being brash , and not having many likeable characters . however , the rest will love this movie for being brave , brash , and unlike anything we 've ever experienced before . ---------------- 10		10		1
blamed for bombing the kremlin , the imf is disavowed -lrb- no support -rrb- by the us government , but ethan hunt -lrb- tom cruise -rrb- knows hendricks -lrb- michael nyqvist -rrb- did the bombing and escaped with nuclear launch codes and hunt also knows he must be stopped from starting a nuclear war . it always amazes me that the bad guys want to blow up the planet and do n't seem to realize they will go with it . so what 's the point ? here 's one more thing that amazed me in this story . the imf is disavowed , but when they go to dubai and mumbai they have all the equipment they need to do the job . so where did all the electronics , magnetic climbing gloves etc come from ? and , one more thing that is truly amazing : going about or more in a crowded downtown mumbai . that just does n't happen . oh , i almost forgot : there is a sand storm in dubai and ethan hunt is chasing bad guy hendricks in it . i was amazed at how many other vehicles are still in the storm going very fast although everyone -lrb- that would be us -rrb- can see that no one can see where anyone is going . simply amazing . okay , okay , movie magic ... ... . i hope . all the above aside , this is a very good action movie . the fight scenes with or without cgi were excellent . the acting by all is terrific and yes , tom cruise actually does his own stunts . if he keeps it up one day he will be watching someone else do those stunts from a wheel chair . watching him do those stunts , i have only one thing to say : ouch , ouch and ouch ! hey , i checked myself into the er after watching him perform those stunts in that automatic car park in mumbai . i could barely move . we get to see the tallest building in the world in dubai : the burj khalifa building . i got dizzy just looking at it from afar . and , yet ethan hunt goes climbing on its windows with magnetic gloves . again , i could n't move and tried not to look down . the action is practically non-stop and there is no time for character development . and , if that is what you are looking for , do n't watch action movies . oh , you get bits and pieces and it 's up to you to fill in the blanks . hey , you did it with the james bond movies . and , to be honest , this mission impossible movie is every bit as good as the bond movies . and , it has that good mi music too . at the end of this we see that ethan hunt now has his imf team and we should see more of them in future movies . just hope `` dem bones '' of tom cruise hold up . one of the things i like about the mission impossible movies is that when we are told something in the beginning , we buy it and then find out later that what we were told was n't exactly true . it 's like a magician doing his mis-direction thing . i love it , but i can not tell you what that one thing was . sorry . this may be the best mission impossible movie so far and was very enjoyable and despite some observations above we , who love action movies , should just enjoy what we have . -lrb- 10/10 -rrb- violence : yes . sex ; no . nudity : no . language : no f-bombs . only one s-word was heard .		10		1
`` batman begins '' is the long-awaited screen return of the caped crusader , whose last outing in `` batman & robin '' -lrb- 1997 -rrb- met with disastrous results . here , the dc comics titan of the title is given a fresh start by director christopher nolan -lrb- `` memento , '' `` insomnia '' -rrb- and a new -lrb- albeit -rrb- unlikely face to boot - christian bale . nolan 's -lrb- mostly -rrb- brilliant film is an exercise of sheer timing and is something that even the most devout of `` batman '' purists can -lrb- finally -rrb- appreciate . tim burton 's 1989 film adaptation of the `` batman '' legend returned the character to the darker , grittier , more noirish origins bob kane had envisioned , and is perhaps the best screen vision of the dark knight . the gotham city in that picture was a decaying metropolis that was overrun with crime and corruption , and though many decried the casting of michael keaton as bruce wayne , he nonetheless fit the bill perfectly by exuding the moodiness and torment of the character he was playing . burton 's film was something extraordinary in the making as well , being that it was influenced greatly by the works of frank miller , namely `` the dark knight returns '' and `` year one , '' both of which apparently also played a hand into nolan 's picture . but since `` batman begins '' takes place before burton 's films -lrb- and nolan 's vision discards that arc entirely -rrb- , any comparisons are void and a waste of time and therefore , it must be judged on its own merits . to me , batman is the most mythical and mysterious of superheroes , being he 's a playboy and a brilliant philanthropist but suffers from deep psychological issues and is missing a few screws from an otherwise well-oiled machine . that quality of mysticism , to me , is at the heart of this dark and mysterious character known as the batman , who `` would have to be some kind of a freak to go out at night dressed up as a bat . '' nolan 's film dives right into the character of bruce wayne and his metamorphosis into the dark knight of gotham city . as the film opens , we see wayne -lrb- played wonderfully by bale -rrb- is being held prisoner by henri ducard -lrb- liam neeson -rrb- and his minions . recognizing the anger festering inside him , ducard appoints himself wayne 's mentor and begins training him for his -lrb- not yet realized -rrb- destiny . years have passed since bruce left gotham city to travel the globe , never to return , after his parents were murdered and the man responsible was executed outside the courthouse . while here , he enters into harsh training with the league of shadows , a band of stealth vigilante ninjas who have an apparent organization all over the world , not just in the mountains of asia . but when bruce draws a line between being judge and executioner , he becomes a marked man by the league , and makes mortal enemies out of ducard and the group 's leader ra 's al ghul -lrb- ken watanabe -rrb- . meanwhile in gotham , things have gotten steadily worse since bruce forced himself into exile away from the city . on the business front , bruce must contend with a ruthless corporate raider -lrb- rutger hauer -rrb- , and a powerful gangster named carmine falcone -lrb- tom wilkinson -rrb- controls the city 's central criminal elements and assistant d.a. rachel dawes -lrb- katie holmes -rrb- - who 's also a childhood friend of bruce - is trying her best to find a way to have him incarcerated . falcone 's wave of terror , however , is mere child 's play compared to the scheme being orchestrated by corrupt arkham asylum psychiatrist dr. jonathan crane -lrb- cillian murphy -rrb- , who moonlights as a hooded maniac called `` the scarecrow '' and is unearthing plans to contaminate gotham 's water supply with a powerful hallucinogenic drug that when vaporized and inhaled , will drive the denizens of the crime-ridden narrows insane and then they 'll begin to tear the city apart . when it becomes apparent that crane is not working alone in his devious plans and that he is merely a pawn being used by a mysterious third party , bruce is forced to spring into action as batman . `` batman begins , '' put simply , is a comic book fan 's dream ; i do n't have any other way to describe it . like last year 's `` spider-man 2 , '' a lot more is done right than wrong . nolan 's film exhibits all of the best qualities of the dark knight by shying away from any camp elements and creating a vision that 's not only bold and faithful to its source material -lrb- and most rabid of fans -rrb- , but is also quite scary . i guess that i should also make it clear that this is by no means a children 's movie , despite its `` pg-13 '' rating . when wayne first dawns the batsuit , he 's quite naturally clumsy , so it takes him a while to get used to it . and of course with the help of his faithful butler alfred -lrb- michael caine -rrb- , weapons designer lucius fox -lrb- morgan freeman -rrb- who first introduces us to the bad-ass batmobile that would make hummer and cadillac both blush with envy , and the only honest cop left in gotham city - james gordon -lrb- gary oldman -rrb- , batman is able to restore some order to the city . christian bale is cast amazingly well , almost surely joining the ranks of keaton , who without any bias is my preferred choice for the role of the dark knight . bale is cool when he has to be playboy bruce , but when it comes time for action in the batsuit , he takes on a whole new dimension . this is the first film of christopher nolan 's that i 've truly liked , and his direction here is standout , making this batman that much more brooding and haunted . he also effectively cast much of gotham in impenetrable shadows , thus making it the most distinct place of any movie today and almost making it impossible to see what 's in that alley some character is walking into . `` batman begins '' is not your father 's batman , and that 's a good thing . it 's a triumph of timing and skill , and as the film 's ending would have it , sequels are most definitely on the way . 10/10		10		1
i saw this as an avid fan of gilbert and sullivan and i love jim broadbent so seemed like a perfect treat . and it was . how accurate it is or not makes no difference to me as everything else worked stupendously . although the film is almost three hours i had no problem with it , and i actually liked the relaxed approach to the film 's pace . mike leigh 's direction is superb , the cinematography and period details are beautifully evoked , the story is engaging and moving , the writing is witty , funny and wise and the music is amazing . the acting is great . jim broadbent is absolutely tremendous as gilbert and his chemistry with allan who is fantastic as well is what makes work so wonderfully . i was also surprised at how well timothy spall did carrying the tunes , and lesley manville is suitably quiet and composed as gilbert 's wife - loved the superbly written and performed speech . all in all , an absolutely brilliant film and not to be missed whether you love g & s or not . 10/10 bethany cox		10		1
raiders of the lost ark is a timeless classic . there now with that said and out of the way i can honestly say i feel that way because raiders of the lost ark is perhaps the only movie that does n't promise you anything but it gives you everything a movie lover wants . clearly george lucas and spielberg 's love affair with the old serials and old comic books paid off big . this movie is a homage to a age we will never see again the real golden age of movie making . harrison ford is indiana jones forget the casting of tom selleck selleck could not have pulled it off as well as ford . spielberg remarked that they needed a actor of the level of bogart who both said would 've been perfect for the role of indy . i could see bogart playing indiana jones and grace kelly or lauren bacall playing marion ravenwood while errol flynn could 've chewed the scenery as belloq or maybe rathbone being belloq . this movie is timeless and any cast from the golden age of hollywood would 've done justice to it . this movie needs to be in every serious movie lover 's collection .		10		1
brilliance pure genius this movie is easily the best one in the series and having sean connery playing indiana 's dad is nothing short of a masterful stroke . we explore indy 's past as we join him on a adventure to find his dad who vanished while searching for the holy grail . this movie was intended to be the last film in the indiana jones series and the film makers aimed high and met their mark and exceeded it . i had so much fun watching this movie that i ca n't find anything wrong with it . the actors all hit their marks beautifully and they carry this film wonderfully on their shoulders and create a classic that equals raiders of the lost ark . . they say citizen kane is the example of how perfect a movie can be well orson welles could 've taken lessons from lucas spielberg and ford because this movie is more then a sequel . it 's one of the best films of all time .		10		1
`` the petrified forest '' is set in a diner in the arizona desert , and focuses on the characters there prior to and during the take-over of the diner by a notorious killer and his gang . the film is based on a play , and it is not surprising given that all but one scene is set at the diner . bette davis gives a fine performance as an idealist young waitress that is enchanted by a vagabond that happens upon the diner , alan squier . my favorite performance of the film was from leslie howard as alan squier , the directionless , weary and philosophizing intellectual . all of the dialogue in this film was well-written , but squier 's lines are particularly eloquent and his references to books and historical figures are interesting . humphrey bogart is also great in his breakthrough role as duke mantee , the notorious killer . mantee is gruff , controlling and at times sarcastic , but he has a slow , piercing voice and a methodical manner . the supporting performances are also of note too , particularly that of the excited grandfather often ready with invented tales . the film 's premise is simple , so this film relies on its characterizations and dialogue to retain viewer interest . both are equal to the task , the dialogue remains engaging as the characters share their innermost thoughts and the film considers american society of the time , and especially love and self-sacrifice .		10		1
cronenberg is a media darling who can do no wrong in the eyes of the critics . even the critics who do n't like this film only dislike it because it is not up to the `` usual high standards '' set by its director . to condemn him absolutely is to loose one 's `` cool '' status in the eyes of one 's peers . cronenberg 's primary interest is to make morally and physically repellent films that propagate his credo of moral degeneracy and ugliness to an audience of gore connoisseurs . his recent evolution from primary schlockmeister to purveyor of a more `` psychological '' brand of filth - which has been called `` his going mainstream '' - has film critics and other closet gorehounds utterly entranced and delirious . see them swoon , see them falter , see them faint , see them wet themselves ... this is the director , after all , who deconstructed viggo mortensen 's `` lord of the rings '' persona as a knight in shining armour by turning him into yet another gun-happy , wooden-faced hit man in `` a history of violence '' - a very profound piece of film-making based on ... a comicbook . his latest effort reprises this conceit . mortensen still has the acting range of a wooden plank but , this time , his director uses an actual script written by an actual writer -lrb- he wrote episodes of `` who wants to be a millionaire '' -rrb- about a russian crime family in london in order to sustain interest . but the result is basically the same , i.e. to see how many acts of violence one can fit in a theatrical feature without the patrons actually vomiting in the aisles . this film has everything to please an -lrb- american -rrb- audience avid for sadistic thrills that leave nothing to the imagination and to captivate a generation raised on violent video games : mob executions , moral turpitude , medical emergencies , creative violence aplenty , kinky sex , unpunished injustice and evil-doing , stereotypical noir atmosphere , caricatures and clichés passing as acting and plot points , you name it , it 's all here . for the ladies and the gay part of the audience , cronenberg has been generous enough to feature that darling viggo 's penis for a good ten minutes , which should make up for the absence of the / / scenes of the first opus . the only thing funnier than the actual dialogue of this film - if you can rise above the blood long enough to enjoy it - is the adjectives the critics use to glorify this idiot-savant of a director who is laughing all the way to the bank . even though this film defames russian emigrants as much as the latest 35-year cycle of american mafioso films defames italian-americans , no russian nationals were actually harmed during the shooting of this film . they are all played by non-russians with varying degrees of embarrassment . vincent -lrb- `` irréversible '' -rrb- cassel 's main qualification for his role , for instance , is that he has been playing the same character for very nearly a dozen films as well as in real life . decadent filth for a jaded , desensitized , morally bankrupt society ? da ! repulsive ? duh !		1		0
i really liked the first pirates movie . the second was so-so , but it was clearly a set up for the big finale , so i thought , let 's expect the best . i have not seen a film this bad in a very long time . i kept thinking of the liz taylor `` cleopatra '' or cimino 's `` heaven 's gate '' - massive amounts of money flushed down the toilet -lrb- or snorted up someone 's nose , which is more likely -rrb- . the story starts out strong ; the special effects are great . some of the camera work is superb ... but then , there 's the dialog - wretch wretch wretch ! people do not speak this way - even video game characters do not speak this way ! and not fun at all . and the idiotic cgi ; and the terrible film-school student editing - and expecting the big finale ? - turns out this is just a build-up to the sequel - what happens to calypso ? where is the fountain of youth ? will what 's - her-name and what 's - his-face ever get it together in real life ? and do i care ? will i ever care again ? absolutely not ! no plastic cups , no posters , no toys , no nothing - satan , get thee well behind me . and mr. depp and mr. rush - the two major talents wasted in this slop - shame on you . finally , a word of warning - disney studios has the disgusting gall to market this as a kid 's film - do not take any children to see this film - extreme violence ; gore ; paganism ; -lrb- humorless -rrb- dirty jokes ; implicit cunnilingus - this is the most wretched display of perverse adult cynicism i have ever seen - and they sell it to children ?! disney - shame ! damnation would be too gentle a curse for like of this trash . walt , and pour fire and brimstone on the heads of your betrayers ! hell hath no mercy - well , that about sums it up , does n't it .		1		0
no long review ... i 'm gon na keep this short & sweet . this has got to be one of the worst movies ever ! certainly it ranks up there in one of the worst best picture oscar winners . i simply ca n't understand the popularity of this movie ... it just drags and drags and drags . it literally has one scene in the movie that holds any interest for me and of course that 's the classic chariot race scene . if you 've never seen this movie but you feel you must , i would advise you to get a dvd & immediately click on the chariot scene . if you do that , you 'll have seen the only worthwhile part of this movie . if you want to watch a fun , entertaining biblical epic , check out the ten commandments , again with charlton heston . it tends to lean toward the campy , actually , but that 's really what makes it fun . demille wound up making a melodrama on the epic scale instead of a ponderous , deadly slow film like ben hur . ben hur is one bad movie and i love movies ... have seen thousands and i 'm telling you : this is the worst !!!!		1		0
does the prospect of watching elves , warriors and wizards talk and talk and talk , interrupted by seven or eight nearly identical sequences appeal to you ? if you liked willow , legend , dune , spawn , gladiator this is pretty much the same thing . if you liked star wars -lrb- which singlehandedly ruined movies -rrb- you 'll like this sermon . george lucas stole most of his star wars story from this . this movie has the same things wrong with it that all costly blockbusters do . they 're too expensive to risk being original so you get a lot of scenes that barely mask their origins in previous blockbusters . you get thrill-ride special effects sequences -lrb- that are n't very thrilling -rrb- in place of any really engaging ideas . characters with for 3 hours . a script like this is for people who resent having to find meaning themselves and just want the characters to tell them what a movie means . then they can declare it `` high-art '' because of it 's pseudo-poetic pretensions -lrb- spawn , final fantasy -rrb- and it 's wagnerian pretensions . i guess that makes paintings of english cottages with thatched -lrb- you can buy at a starving artists sale -rrb- masterpieces too . you 'd have to be under five to miss any of the supposed `` allegorical '' meaning here . i doubt you 'll remember a single line from it after you leave . it lacks subtlety , a unifying idea , a , anything entertaining or challenging etc. . this is a tedious by-the-books filmed book . an overwrought score -lrb- ripped off again from karl orff 's carmina -rrb- attempts to make you feel emotions that the script has neglected . a huge percentage of fans saw it the first two days and have positive reviews the web . hopefully the second wave of opinions will push the title off of top ten lists where it does not belong . it might be the number one filmed book of all time , but it ai n't a film . this is not the worst movie ever made but it is utterly mediocre with lazy scripting & visualization ; a catalog of the standards that became in movies over the last decade of the twentieth century . there is little that 's unique or memorable in this movie . the chases in this movie look exactly like what chases have looked like in films for seventy years . there are plenty of early warning signs that it 's a lemon : narration that obfuscates and before you even get your bearings -lrb- remember dune ? -rrb- . leaden lines of expository dialogue tell you things instead of showing them to you . every fifteen minutes someone spouts `` we 're nearing the -lrb- blank -rrb- of -lrb- blank -rrb- i.e , the pit of , the caves of killjoy , the chasm of infinite boredom , etc. . . the names are unintelligible and the effect is comical . it 's just an arbitrary sequence of events that occur along the path to a goal , which is never even reached -lrb- ! -rrb- . it has no dramatic arc . whether this journey went on for 90 minutes or 3 hours makes no difference to fans because the generation that thinks star wars is a good movie does n't realize that sw chucked pacing , character development or even building a story . hopefully digital epics will wear out their welcome much the same way the pre-digital epics from the fifties and sixties did . it 's not good that actors are capable of reading a script like this and thinking it 's good , but it 's worse that audience is waiting to call it a masterpiece . this movie is junk . it 's really depressing that people could mistake this for even an adequate movie . tolkein fans are gushing over it because they bring feelings -lrb- established while reading the book -rrb- with them and project them onto the movie . but you get the sense that these people would think a film about three people sitting around talking about hobbits would be a masterpiece too . if you 're interested in a movie and it 's a little pretentious , anything you like is a masterpiece . but , whether a director has embalmed a book is not decent criteria for declaring a film a masterpiece . the geeks who are saying so have no higher goal for a movie than that it be made from a book they love . the `` kewl '' visuals resembling the cd-rom game myst are a plus . the fans are spastic to get online to tell you that it 's a masterpiece and that it does n't match the way they visualized it . hey guess what , that 's not any decent films job ! the final scene of the movie in which two hobbits confirm that they are great friends as they move off to address the threat the movie has been plodding towards for 3 hours , is absurd . this is n't the kind of story where the friendship of 2 hobbits means anything conclusive ; getting to the point would have been swell . bring a cast iron butt and an alarm clock with you . watching it is a feat of endurance .		1		0
people tend to cut comedies lots of slack as long as they make us laugh . they can be blasphemous , tasteless , lowbrow , highbrow , moronic , offensive , racist , subversive , disgusting , pretentious , pointless , shallow , blatantly left-wing , blatantly right-wing , vulgar , cruel , preachy , you name it -- if they make us laugh our butts off , we 'll forgive them any and all of these sins . if they just are n't funny , like this turkey , that 's when we start noticing all the bad stuff . and there is plenty of bad stuff , believe me , starting with steve martin , who exhausted his tiny bag of comedic tricks more than twenty years ago and who has been coasting along ever since . i think this movie is where he finally coasts to a dead stop . please , hollywood , just leave him there . and then there 's the story . bringing down the house is a movie evidently written by people who do n't have a clue about either of the cultures involved in the clash . the result is a bunch of crudely drawn caricatures of nonexistent social types . nobody thinks white people or black people are anything like this , and it is insulting to have to sit through a movie made by people who think we do .		1		0
i do n't know of any other sci-fi series that polarized its viewer 's opinion the way this show did , and when i looked at the bonus material on the dvd , i could now see why ron moore was so stressing its virtues , because comments in the bonus material was a direct rebuttal to the criticisms that was going around on the internet . first of all , let me tell you that i had nothing against this series or ron moore when the series started . i 've actually paid $ 45 and bought the entire season 1 dvd set not knowing what to expect , and ron moore is the one who wrote one of my favorite star trek tng 's episode `` tapestry '' , so i had no bias in that regards either , but ... this series sends negative message to the audiences who may still be at their young and impressionable age . the negative messages are the following : if you are angry , and troubled , then somehow you are a serious -lrb- and important -rrb- person -lrb- take the characters of adama , tigh , and roslyn , they are all harboring a dormant hostility 100 % of the time . other characters are also on and off hostile overtly or covertly -rrb- . if the plot is about `` unexpected danger '' somehow it 's more realistic -lrb- not only the battle situation is almost 100 % constructed out of this one theme , the interaction between people are almost 100 % constructed out of this plot ploy also -rrb- . people who may turn against you on a dime are depicted as the `` norm '' in this series . i do n't want to live in a society where people would have an idea that such society is a normal society . this bsg series is filled with these unhealthy paradigms . the visual tone is rehash of all the `` darker '' sci-fi fantasies of the '90s , but what ron moore has missed was that in the 2000s , the mood is lightening up much more , and this reliance on `` darkness '' -lrb- as he was proudly saying in the dvd bonus material `` it is darker . it is more story driven . '' -rrb- is starting to be a passé . take `` batman returns '' for instance . the visuals of the gotham city is dark and gloomy , but the people in the story have more optimistic outlook , and are genuinely trying to make matters better , which gives hope that even in a dump there 's hope if there are few good people like this . i do n't want our youth -lrb- and adults -rrb- to think that if they acted `` angry '' and `` troubled '' people around them will see them as serious , and important person , but this program is filled with this kind of innuendos . in the real society , such people are just `` unhappy '' people who also makes other people unhappy , and i hope television shows which are viewed by its audience almost uncensored would stop depicting such characters as `` heros '' . my opinion is ditto for the plot . if it 's filled with people in trouble , then somehow it 's a `` story driven '' plot line . hogwash . other unspeakable inconsistencies of just making things look like they 're from antique auction have been mentioned by number of reviewers here , so i wo n't go into them , but i am against the philosophy of just making things look `` ugly -lrb- or old -rrb- '' and equating that as being more realistic . the original bsg at least had quality that did n't just make things more ugly and call it realism . it might have been cheesy by today 's standard , but they did take a poke at the best vision of the future that they could have at the time and presented it to the tv audience . i know that people who saw it the first time was awed by its visual effects . for its effort at depicting the best future technologies , i think the original bsg series deserves an a + . i ca n't say the same for this bsg series . everything is a borrowed idea from somewhere , and it tries to say that it 's more realistic by making things uglier . it gets a c - for originality . i think many of the people who had negative opinions about this show have also sensed the unhealthy undercurrent of this show . i hope that sci-fi channel and all future sci-fi series producers will take a serious look at this and try to produce a genuinely original product that is of their own idea and effort which really does convey original message to its audience . finally for one interesting comment another reviewer have made : why are negative comments for this show here at imdb all have near perfect 50/50 approval and disapproval ratio ? it makes you wonder does n't it ? p.s. it 's now 2011 , 5 years since i 've wrote the original comment , and i could say that i was right about my original assessment that these guys had no originality , from the course that the series seems have taken after season 2 - it just fizzled and fell apart as far as i can tell . my conclusion that i wrote 5 years ago still stands : i hope that sci-fi channel and all future sci-fi series producers will take a serious look at this and try to produce a genuinely original product that is of their own idea and effort which really does convey original message to its audience . - with good quality .		1		0
the green hornet -- trash it -lrb- c - -rrb- the green hornet hands down the worst tedious super hero i 've ever seen . i may be able to digest seth rogan as the ultimate casanova or maybe a billionaire but seth rogan as ass-kicking superhero ? that 's way too much to digest . now seth rogan was completely miscast but they could have cast a perfect sidekick but sadly side kick jay chou is as worse as seth rogan has been in the green hornet . from beginning to end , the whole movie does n't make any sense and the only time i laughed besides james f ** king franco 's cameo was on the horridness of the movie . cameron diaz is getting old as even they referred to her when she comes for an interview for a secretary . christoph waltz was wasted and was n't funny or -lrb- scary -rrb- at all . overall , trash this garbage .		1		0
for some reason speed seems to be above criticism . it does n't deserve this regard . i 've never liked this film , and for a long list of reasons . i remember clearly the summer of 1994 when it became a sleeper hit . ` die hard on a bus ' they called it . erm ... no . more like ` the poseidon adventure on a bus ' . everybody knows the story by now , which is the sign of a high-concept idea . but i 'm not captured by it . a bomb threat on a yuppie elevator ends with the bomber apparently blowing himself up in the parking lot . the lapd can not allow the yuppies to fall a breathtaking per second into the basement -lrb- it honestly moves at this ` speed ' with none of them affected by zero-gravity -rrb- . the bomber claims he invested 3 years into this plan , but overnight he a better plan -lrb- all with just a single thumb -rrb- in which a bus will blow up if it falls below 50 mph . half-witted cop jack traven races to the rescue . but instead of the bus 's tires he simply yells at the driver to stop . he does n't . once on-board they barge through traffic jams , hard corners , magically jump over 50-foot gaps -lrb- launched by invisible ramps it seems -rrb- , and argue among themselves . the passengers are an undynamic bunch of cardboard cut-outs -lrb- burly worker in hat , long-faced african woman , whiny old crone , unemployed bachelor , geeky tourist -rrb- who never once get our sympathies . many of them do n't even have any dialogue and just sit there as if the threat of being blown to smithereens is a daily occurrence . also , if i were jack traven , i 'd put a bullet in the head of that annoying helen before she even got a chance to draw air into her lungs in order to make her first complaint . directed by former cinematographer jan de bont -lrb- who is actually responsible for making die hard look as good as it does -rrb- , it 's a high-key movie -lrb- to the point of almost being sterile -rrb- with lots of destruction and well-choreographed action , but he has no idea how to direct actors or build character . between the action scenes there are painful lulls which are not helped by the frequently awful dialogue and poor writing . perhaps i should say poor re-writing . though graham yost is the only credited writer the script was significantly re-written by joss whedon , who made many changes . originally the bomber was revealed to be jeff daniels ' character , but after whedon created howard payne the character of harry temple became redundant by the end of the second act and he 's needlessly killed off . other elements of the original draft are fossilized into the story and give it an irregular flow . there are so many other contrivances and lazy explanations that i just ca n't forgive . jack traven realizes that there is a camera on the bus when payne refers to sandra bullock as ` the wildcat ' , despite the fact that the ancient camera payne has hooked up inside the vehicle has nowhere near enough resolution to make out the wildcat logo on her jacket -lrb- which she is also leaning against -rrb- . keanu reeves ' acting is so bad it makes seagal look like olivier . do n't get me wrong , i like keanu , but he 's excruciatingly awful in this film . his puzzling facial expressions and just plain bizarre pronunciation of certain words gives jack traven -lrb- already an unlikeable character -rrb- a semi-retarded edge . i longed for payne to get away with it . apparently vic armstrong was up for directing this but the producers went for jan de bont because of his lengthy camera credits . the success of the film is purely down to star power and its high concept . it 's nothing to do with de bont 's ability as a director -lrb- which is why he has n't worked since 2003 -rrb- and i know that armstrong would have made a better movie , even if he was stuck with keanu -lrb- who he worked with a year later on notorious flop johnny mnemonic -rrb- , who could n't even act ill if he had the flu . speed is not a good film . it 's a badly-written early 90s relic . i just can not even begin to understand the adoration its gathered over the years .		1		0
the first few oliver stone movies i watched i liked . wallstreet and talk radio were good films . then , apparently , oliver stone either went insane -lrb- the most probable assumption -rrb- or he became so `` full of himself '' that he thought he could do no wrong -- and make up facts as he went along in films such as nixon , jfk and alexander . however , despite his `` truth impairment '' , this is not the biggest reason i think stone is nuts . no , it 's producing an ultra-violent film -lrb- sort of like a snuff film -rrb- and then having the absolute gall to say it 's a film that 's anti-violence !!!!! that 's like viewing the birth of a nation and saying it 's a film that encourages positive race relations , ... or watching the diary of anne frank and saying it 's `` '' !!!! so , either stone is full of himself and also full or crap or he really is 100 % crazy to produce such a vile and violent mess and claim it 's done to help curb and expose our violent society ! get that man some therapy !!		1		0
1 -rrb- the name above the title : carpenter made one legit , scary hit and then his name moved above the title as an ego-stroking , marketing ploy . it turned out that he was on a downward trend from halloween and the value of his name in a movies title became negligible . he has been happy to be a fanboy trafficking in familiar horror imagery and scenarios without adding much , committed to motifs that date his movies before they are even out . 2 -rrb- has-beens : hal holbrook plays the fallen priest we had all come to know from the exorcist etc. . janet leigh -lrb- ! -rrb- and houseman are slumming here . 3 -rrb- designed horror : perhaps more time was spent on designing the high-concept glowing red eyes of the pirates -lrb- which can only elicit the reaction `` neat ! '' -rrb- than producing an actual scare in this movie . 4 -rrb- dumb psychology : how can a child be so dumb that he does n't realize the person tearing his bedroom door to pieces with a meat hook is not his elderly baby sitter ? etc. 5 -rrb- horror clichés - the car that wo n't start - the child in peril - the wronged spirit that ca n't rest ... all sense is abandoned getting these elements into a movie . 6 -rrb- the horror movie is a limp , dead genre . it has into `` scary movies , '' and `` thrillers . '' no one talks of `` horror '' movies anymore , because we have n't been horrified by a monster in decades . -lrb- only `` alien '' comes to mind -rrb- . this movie is a limp artifact ready for dispatch in a time capsule .		1		0
to think that michael douglas believes he is still fit for an action role is really sad news for me -lrb- and i 'm a real fan of much of his work -rrb- . i mean , never mind the `` funny '' undertone , the man believes he can still carry a action part , with all thew fighting and flying involved . this is a cross between `` meet the parents '' and `` i spy '' with immense script loop-holes and really silly , cliché dialog . pathetic and not funny at all . i mean imagine robert de niro 's character in `` meet the parents '' kicking ass left and right and abducting the father of the bride to europe to catch an arms-dealer ... !?! stupid . albert brooks seems to have been forced to appear in this -lrb- much like his abducted character -rrb- , and i will not even start on the ugly tori spelling look-alike daughter in law of michael douglas 's character . where did they dig her up from ? is she the daughter of the producer , or what ? man , this has disaster written all over it ...		1		0
human centipede -lrb- first sequence -rrb- has three abject victims - one a stereotypical japanese character who keeps yelling hoarse and two bimbos , one of whom talks like a dimwitted child . the perpetrator is a surgeon who has those typical z-grade horror looks and deep voice . the director is an rather grisly ed wood in the making by the name of tom six or rather tom sicko who ca n't direct to save his life . the writing mainly consists of moaning , screaming , whimpering and screeching and a few dialogues that are so atrocious they are just kept to bring the characters to the surgeon 's house . the first few scenes look as if the girls are being chased already by the madman since they are so frightened right from the start . the japanese actor has nothing to do but yell incoherently and writhe in pain . even the girls have unappealing bodies so there was no eye-candy to salvage the hopeless film . in short , this movie sucks . my rating : 1/10		1		0
john polson is quite an inept director -lrb- he also directed last year 's flop robert de niro film , `` hide and seek '' -rrb- and this 2002 venture was no change of pace for him . jesse bradford stars -lrb- and i use the word `` stars '' rather than `` plays , '' since his `` performance '' is no more than using a single facial expression for 80 minutes -rrb- as a high school jock who is seduced by erika christensen and then stalked by her . it 's `` fatal attraction '' with teens and it 's ridiculous . the script has problems from the beginning and most of the movie is just a way of cashing in on the '80s ' obsession with - fortunately this helped prove definitively that their crossover into the new millennium was , shall we say , not very successful .		1		0
since the release of 300 there has been a raise in pseudo-historical films geared to more adult audiences such as black death , solomon kane and centurion just to name a few . in the midst of the raise of this genre is ironclad , one of the most insult and terrible and it offensive to anyone who has a slight be of historical knowledge after a brutal civil war with his barons king john -lrb- paul giamatti -rrb- was forced to sign the magna carta which limits his power in 1215 . but a year later john reneges on the deal and with a group of danish pagan mercenaries -lrb- in real life denmark was a christian country at this time -rrb- and starts to kill all the barons that made sign the treaty . once baron , william d'aubigny -lrb- brian cox -rrb- takes a stand and seizes rochester castle with knights templar thomas marshall -lrb- james purefoy -rrb- as the archbishop of canterbury -lrb- charles dance -rrb- tries to get the french to support the rebellion . d'aubigny and marshall with 20 men have hold rochester against king john 's army as they wait for reinforcements . historically this film has gotten its fact wrong badly and it seems no cared at all . writer/director jonathan english made out that d'aubigny was standing up for the freedom of the people and that king john was a false king , ignore that d'aubigny inherited his title , he died a loyalist and that the barons were far from representing the people more their self interests . they barons only cared about the lower classes for their tax take , that 's it , there was no notion of freedom , of believing that the monarchy was a false form of government when it would have been seen as too radical to overthrow the whole system . this film is even more insulting when it shows king john as a vengeful , violence sadist , who commit 's the acts himself , including chopping the hands of a character . john only has danes fighting for him when in reality he had english supporters and one of the most stupid things the film pushes is at the end when the narrators says that john was overthrown and a french prince became king , even thought in reality it was john 's son inherited the throne . but even if you can look pass the awful history ironclad is still a terrible film . i am sure a lot of people wanted to see it for the action and even that 's fails because the camera work is some of the worst i have seen in a mainstream film . it looked like the cameraman was drunk throughout as the camera could not stay still and with the ultra quick editing it was impossible to tell what was going one . it was a relief when there was a wide shot , even if it only lasted a few seconds . this was a film that really enjoyed and linger on the violence . whilst i expected it bloody this film was too over the top , including a man being beaten with a severed arm and a danish soldier gets hacked in half and that it seemed to be the only point of the film . there were a few fun moments but they are few and far between . on a character and acting level the film was bare bones . king john was pretty much playing edward i in braveheart whilst d'aubigny is william wallace and i hated braveheart with a passion . they were one dimensional characters and the actors were seemingly having a competition on who can over act the most . d'aubigny is a jerk , he enforces a conflict on reginald de -lrb- derek jacobi -rrb- and the film actually had to make him dislikeable by giving him a young wife in the form of kate mara just so d'aubigny is more sympathetic . and mara was terrible in this film , she was only cast because she has a pretty face : it was a role intended for megan fox which should tell you something . he had no conviction in her delivery and a blank facial expression . and the film has the gaul to turn her into a warrior woman . the only two actors that come out of this film with some credit are purefoy who was convincing as the action hero and was treating the film seriously , he deserves to lead a good film . the other is aneurin barnard , a young squire who enters into battle for the first time , playing his role with conviction , even if he is playing a clichéd role of a young man who has to that there is nothing noble about the violence of battle -lrb- seeing that this is a film wanting the audience to revival in the violence it 's a little hypocritical -rrb- . jason too seemed like he was having fun with his role but it was a dump role . if you have any interest in history this a film to avoid and even if you are an action junkie or someone who is a fan of cinema violence will be disappointed because you can not tell what is happening . this is a film to miss . watch 300 or centurion instead .		1		0
as i went recently to disneyland with my nephews , we took the tour and this movie is the same : dark , misty , with filthy pirates , great for the eyes but lacking of a story . this was actually my first pirates movie i saw -lrb- and the last , i think -rrb- and was taken aback at the start with the characters . they seem to know each other but nothing is explained . the coming of penelope is a waste because she does nothing here except walking . if she was so pregnant , why cast her ? the story of the youth fountain is a rip-off from the `` last crusade '' . the character of deep does n't make me laugh . the only funny moment was with the swinging ship and it 's not enough . i even slept between the escape from london and the attack of the mermaid : what 's the fun of being in the hold of a ship by night ? at last , hook has better taste and as it 's another spielberg reference , you can understand the difference of levels and vision between the two . i chose steven and those damn pirates have indeed robbed me of my money !		1		0
even as my prescribing , i by chance -lrb- always on the lookout for -rrb- read from the `` new edition '' , and am really happy to buy the movie now , and affordable , and still be able to blu ray . i think films like the lion king are no longer on the market . sure we have great films , but there were twice as like a disney movie the lion king , which moves really young and old , laugh , dance where young and old , and weep ? i think it 's the best disney movie of all time and am thrilled to see the movie with my children to be allowed . i can only recommend to all parents who do not know the film , he looks at you , and you convinced by what i write here . 5 out of 10 stars , enough for me ; -- rrb - from my perspective , 10 out of 5 stars ! i 've bought the old dvd and then they lost when they move , i was sad one day and i watch it if you do not yet there again and since you will now be i am . after i became a mom , i 'm totally in disney fever and so you need this dvd . purchase as many as you wish ...		1		0
`` alien vs predator '' begins with a contrived plot with one purpose : to bring humans , aliens and predators so that inevitable conflict may ensue . the filmmakers must have thought that the synergy of having aliens and predators in one tremendous battle would be overwhelmingly entertaining . however , `` alien vs predator '' is an exercise in mediocrity and worse than `` alien '' -lrb- 1979 -rrb- and `` predator '' -lrb- 1987 -rrb- . this film 's main weakness is its story , or more appropriately lack thereof . most of the story is limited to the confines of repetitive action sequences . there are some marginal story developments that occur beyond this , but they failed evoke my interest . add to this formula cliché characters and performances and dialogue that is easily forgettable and it becomes clear why `` alien vs predator '' drags throughout its duration . even the film 's final conflict and the subsequent story development are flat . if you have not already seen `` alien vs predator '' , avoid it in earnest .		1		0
made in 1996 , this was an insult to my intelligence . even as a young adult , i found this to bee too stupid to be entertaining . of course , i do n't live in hollywood - wait , i did then ... for a few months . however , this movie is so full of american propaganda that it hurt my head to watch it . from beginning to end and everywhere in between , this movie was just a nasty mess . apart from all the flaws that you read on every other post , this made the usa look so bad in the eyes of other nations that instead of promoting the country to something of a hero , it made the us look like a total mess of self serving , egoistic , glory hungry retards . why had the president and the us armed forces not try to contact any other nation 's leaders in trying to overcome the aliens ? because the us leaders , politicians and gatekeepers want to prove to the world that they have the answer and solution to even the most insane and unforeseen problem attacking the world . there have been lots of horrible movies , but this one is definitely in the top 20 . i knew the us would save the world and i hated the movie for it . i was really hoping that the aliens would blast the out of the usa , so that the rest of the world could possibly try to negotiate some sort of truce with the aliens . as you can see , germany or england , russia or australia did not attack . and the aliens did n't even think of hovering over canada - even though it 's right close to the usa ! what happened there ? by this film , they stood idly by , watching everything fall to the floor in flames and it was only the us that was able to do anything . what a load of s __ t ! too retarded for somebody who does n't fall for american machismo ... too much hollywood for hollywood . what happened to hollywood ? ca n't they find any more bruce willis clones to make action movies anymore ? they have to try to result to dramatic action with a huge cast of characters who in their own right should not be paid 1/10th of the wage they earn . i 'm certain that had brad pitt been a star that year , his ugly mug would have been in there somewhere - as well as his bitch of a wife .		1		0
in what was thinking the great robert altman when he accepted to direct this awful mess ? this is truly and utterly one of the worst films ever made , being the perfect example of how not even the best director is able to save a rotten product like this . i never understood the appeal of live-action versions of cartoons . those movies are completely devoid of fun , joy and beauty and most of them -lrb- all of them , actually -rrb- lack of all the good elements that made the original cartoons to be popular and appreciated in first place . `` popeye '' is n't an exception of this rule . this movie was awful from beginning to end , having -lrb- like other live action version of cartoon -rrb- a very ugly and unappealing visual aspect , but also a very stupid plot which lacks of any single of the virtues from the original popeye cartoons and comics . the jokes were painfully unfunny , the songs were horrible and everything about this movie was simply terrible . robin williams , shelley duval and paul l. smith made here the worst performances of their entire careers , making an awful portrayal of those beloved cartoons characters . this movie was painfully bad , and i consider it to be the perfect example of everything what is wrong with live-action version of cartoons . 0/10 -lrb- i would rate this movie with a negative score if i could -rrb-		1		0
`` heaven can wait '' is a crushing bore and a candy-coated , misogynist lie . i ca n't imagine anyone but film students sitting through it today . don ameche is in almost every scene , and , while he has a mellifluous voice that no doubt contributed to his successful career in radio , he does n't have the charisma to carry this film . ameche plays henry , a womanizer . lubitsch wants to make henry 's sexual incontinence adorable and amusing , and so he directs ameche to play the part as blandly as possible . the combination of ameche 's lack of charisma and lubitsch 's insistence on blandness results in a lead character who is both deadly dull and completely icky . you would n't want to spend any time with this man ; he 'd put you to sleep . you would n't leave him alone with your daughter , no matter her age . something creepy would happen . the movie 's look is quite boring . scene after scene consists of static , overly lighted , shots of fastidiously dressed gilded age stuffed shirts and bustles lounging in excessively busy , victorian parlors . there 's so many ruffles and frills and , so much lilac and sky blue and pink , you need dramamine . this movie hates women as much as hardcore porn , but it presents that hatred with a candy coating and a sweet little bow on top . the contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is sickening . in one of the movie 's most hateful scenes , an elderly woman is sent to hell because she 's not physically attractive .		1		0
i just saw some of this but i just had to turn it off . it was simply too boring and meaningless . obviously this is some kind of attempt at a criticism of `` society '' similar to , say , american psycho but in this movie it is just so pointless and boring . i 'm pretty amazed by the positive review this movie has gotten . it is really stupid and boring . why would we show any interest in the fate of these persons ? they do n't even seem like real characters at all . the whole thing is so amateurish and insignificant that i can not believe it was released at all . anyway , i did watch around 20 minutes of it and that was enough to judge it . i did understand what is about but that is really not a good enough premise to make a movie on .		1		0
i saw this movie thinking it was going to be either really bad or really good . both would have been entertaining . but it is just plain bad , and boring . i saw this movie at the 8:00 showing , and fell asleep . the first half was sooooo boring . i caught just enough of it to catch the plot . then stayed awake for the second half , which made me want to leave the theater . the special effects were decent , but nothing really spectacular . i could probably do that with several million dollars and a computer . the coolest parts of the film was when you see through diesel 's eyes , and the monsters ' eyes . although i have done the special effect of the monsters ' vision with paint shop pro , i have not seen it on the movie screen . in fact , it looked like they just used psp to get all of their visual effects . the rest of the movie was shoddy . the one-liners were not that great -lrb- sometimes movies have some real winners , which this movie did not have -rrb- , the plot sucked , the sub-plots were pretentious , and the story has been done . it could have been such a cool movie if it had better directing , writing , editing , cinematography , visuals , etc. . in fact , i would not wish this movie on my worst enemy -lrb- although i could stomach forcing them to watch deep impact or kazaam or leonard part 6 until they died -rrb- simply because it was so painful . i kept hoping for a good ending , but it never came . also , why were the day time visuals so washed out ? was it just to create a contrast to the dark ? it was so pointless . at least in three kings , the visuals were meant to look like a xerox copy because of the news prints , and such . this did not have a reason to look like that except it was a bad xerox copy of other better movies . vin diesal had potential in his role , but it was never reached . also , i should have drank some of the alcohol that they burned for fuel to get through this movie . snore ! ---------------------------- 1/10		1		0
this is one of the worst movies ever . not scary . terrible acting . thrilling chase scenes are ruined by stupidity from the characters . this movie had terrible death scenes . especially for a horror movie . when jennifer love hewitts character yells `` what are you waiting for '' . you will be thinking the exact same thing . then things get worse . this thing threw up two sequels . the second was much better then this and i have n't seen the third . i do not plan on seeing it . i do not recommend it . should have never been made . 1/10		1		0

keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors , i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films . he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie . scary movie 2 was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters . avoid such titles like do n't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood ... i know , what a title !!! obviously this film too , just anything that has name in the credits . it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh . just trust me on this , maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films ... ... 1/10 ... . . j.d seaton		1		0
this was a boring and uninteresting film . the dialog is unrealistic . carey is a vulnerable actress who lets her emotion show clearly . unfortunately she looks too about 5 years too old for the character and she speaks as if she is much older and wiser than her age or behavior demonstrate . why sarsgard ? he 's so american . the other supporting cast is alright . molina is good but why is his character so idiotic ? overall it is a clichéd storyline . it 's silly how the teachers and principal seem to care so much about her - she 's just a girl who wants to get married after all . why would they take it to heart to stop her ? it 's none of their business . we 've seen it all before . it 's wrong to praise everything that is from across the atlantic like it 's the most wonderful thing ever written .		1		0
how to make saturn 3 : mix a little alien , a little silent running , a little demon seed and then burn it in the oven . kirk douglas and farrah fawcett man a space station on one of the rings of saturn -- for what purpose is anyone 's guess . they take pep pills and exercise a lot . their new-age eden is invaded by psycho harvey keitel who unleashes a horny robot on them . douglas and keitel fight and the robot , named hector , takes a shine to fawcett . this is a terrible movie . it 's surely the worst thing ever directed by the once great stanley donen . poor visual effects and the inexplicable fact that keitel 's voice was dubbed by a british actor add to the movie 's overall cheesiness .		1		0
a woman inadvertently goes back to a zombie infested island where her parents were killed . writer / director claudio fragasso abysmal sequel has very little link to fulci 's zombi . fragasso 's film seems predominantly like mattei 's virus / hell of the living dead / night of the zombies -lrb- 1980 -rrb- . where as night of the zombies was a dawn of the dead wannabe , a bad cheese festival of zombie nonsense , it did n't take it self serious , but this awful film does . while the phrase so bad it 's good can be be applied to night of the zombies , zombi 4 is plain bad with very few , if any redeeming features . there 's awfully executed effects , shoddy lighting , sub-par directing , illogical storytelling and coupled with daft exposition dialogue in every scene it 's simply cheap but not cheerful . talking zombies , guns , candles falling over , jumping undead add up to very little . the 80 's rock soundtrack of is probably the only redeeming feature , which is also terrible and uninspiring . as another cash-in follow up to zombie flesheaters it 's more than disappointing .		1		0
1983 's ` superman 3 ' seemed to be the end for the franchise based on the long-running d.c. comic . christopher reeve said at the london premiere : `` we do n't want to flog it to death like they do on television ! '' . after attempting -lrb- and failing -rrb- to get a ` supergirl ' franchise launched , alexander and ilya salkind sold the ` superman ' rights to the cannon group - menahem golan and yoram globus - the team responsible for tatty , forgettable movies such as chuck norris ' ` the delta force ' and richard chamberlain 's ` king solomon 's mines ' . they lured back reeve by offering him a bigger role in the new film 's production . he promised a return to the epic style of the first movie , directed some second unit work and was responsible for the basic storyline - concerned at the escalating insanity of the cold war , superman breaks his vow of non-interference in other cultures by collecting every nuclear missile he can find and hurling it into the sun . in the meantime , the daily planet has been bought by david warfield -lrb- sam wanamaker -rrb- , a rupert figure who wants to drive it down market . his attractive daughter lacy -lrb- mariel hemingway -rrb- has her eyes set on nerdy clark . the lex luthor -lrb- gene hackman -rrb- creates a superhero of his own - nuclear man -lrb- mark pillow -rrb- - using d , , contained in a lock of superman 's hair . n.m. looks like an extra from ` the robe ' and glows with the power of the sun . with reeve back in the cape , hackman and margot kidder returning as ` lois lane ' -lrb- she was barely on screen in the previous film -rrb- despite her earlier threat to quit , the new film looked to be a surefire winner . it was brave to make a film with a strong pacifist message at the time reagan was in the white house . what went wrong ? for one thing , the cheapness of the production is evident in almost every scene . ` superman ' movies should never look cheap . this is no more noticeable than the sequences where superman destroys the warheads and where nuclear man is created - they are the same . where did superman find a fishing net big enough to take every warhead on earth ? the fight with nuclear man lacks thrills , resembling as it does a bargain basement remake of the scrap with the kryptonian villains in the second film . pillow is laughable as n.m. , coming across like a las vegas male stripper with ideas above his station . the weak script shamelessly recycles ideas such as the ` can you read my mind ? ' scene from the first film . the lapses of logic are such a three year old year could spot them - how does lacy survive being in outer space without oxygen ? ` peace ' flopped and it would be 2006 before superman was seen again , by which time reeve had sadly passed on . the actor later attacked the movie on the b.b.c. 's ` wogan ' show , without referring to the producers by name . a heartbreaking finale to what had started out as a wonderful comic-book series . we can only give thanks that golan and globus never got round to making ` spider-man ' !		1		0
this movie did not do it for me , which is sad because the reviews made me think it would be good . the story line is very slow and i found it boring . i also thought the movie jumped in a few places which then made me wonder what was going on . the romance between the two characters seemed forced to me . one minute they meet , the next they 're having sex in the swimming hole . then he 's arrested . sorry ... . . i pulled the trigger at the swimming hole . was n't in the mood for yet another chick flic relationship thang . was hoping for more ranch life and horse scenes . that said , kids younger than 8 or 9 might get really frightened or hyper because some of the action gets pretty intense -lrb- for a kids ' movie -rrb- . also , some of the adult themes about our hero 's parents having a bad marriage or the father drinking too much might be difficult for kids to understand , or take a bit of maturity . so , this is basically a movie for kids in elementary school , but with some elements that might be better suited for teens . it 's still a pretty appropriate family-type movie because there 's no bad language , little violence -lrb- a punch or two get thrown -rrb- , and little or no real meanness . the movie is basically nothing more than drivel . i would not let my kids come near this movie .		1		0
next -lrb- 2007 -rrb- * nicolas cage , julianne moore , jessica biel , thomas kretschmann . lame , boring and ridiculous adaptation of philip k. dicks ' `` the golden man '' with cage as a two-bit vegas magician who has the ability to see into his future by two minutes and the feds enlisting him to stop a nuclear strike . witless , junky dialogue , cheesy special effects and plotting are the main faults of this laborious thriller . the clunky screenplay by gary goldman , jonathan hensleigh , and paul ; one-note acting by its trio of talented leads ; and leaden direction by lee tamahori should have dick rolling over in his grave .		1		0
this movie is done on a sorta drug or crazy man vision . it is disturbing and just plain stupid . one thing it does well is reflect modern violent society . it shows how sick people and the media can be ; however , they make the lead characters into heroes instead of bad guys , which bothers me .		1		0
i guess it says something when you realize this was anna nicole smith 's first picture and o.j. simpson 's last . the fact they are both in this picture kind of defines what this film stands for : not the highest class of comedy . same on leslie nielsen to be part of this `` comedy '' which has a pastor yelling out jesus christ 's name as a profanity at one point and then mocking mother teresa in another scene . that sort of cheap-shot stuff is still `` politically correct , '' but do n't try it on other religions other than christianity . it 's pretty sad that jewish people - many of them victims of hate - wrote , produced and directed this bigoted hateful `` satiric '' material . i did n't see any other religions made the butt of jokes in this movie . that , and five other blasphemes , numerous sex innuendos make this a real sleazy comedy , more like the stuff that was produced in the 1970s than 1994 . i like good parodies but this was too much below-the-belt stuff that was n't funny . i am not surprised this ended the `` naked gun '' series . they should have quit while they were ahead .		1		0
thinking about this movie puts me to is 170 minutes of your life you will never get back , so think carefully before attempting to watch this far as i can recall -lrb- and it does pain me to do so -rrb- there 's virtually no soldiers walking through field is action.and once in a while , a shot is fired , and some grass flies in to the air , but that 's it.i guess the movie is more about the psychological effects of war , and that 's fine , but in my opinion , there should be some action as well , or at least some interesting movie gave me a headache and depressed me to no end.it 's not for action buff , that much is 's not my bag , that 's for a realistic , riveting and exciting war movie , i 'd recommend saving private word of warning though , it is brutally graphic in its , as for the thin red line , i give it a 110		1		0
tell me if you 've seen this scenario before : a movie that claims to be anti-hollywood , and supposedly has a `` deep moral and social commentary '' that the critics love , only the movie turns out to be pretentious and one of the most pathetic movies ever made . that 's about all there is to say about children of men -- it claimed to come and deliver all of us thriller fans to the promise land , but in reality it was even more pathetic than the multimillion making blockbuster . first , there is nothing intellectual or deep as promised . i can hear the director/writer now : `` i want to make another tired end-of-the-world movie , just like the ones i grew up watching on saturday morning cartoons and then saw done in live-action more so many times it almost seemed cliché ... but , umm , i can be original . hey ! instead of a virus wiping out humanity , let 's make women unfertile , but everything else will be just like every other end-of-the-world movie ever made . '' sadly , i guess people did n't pay attention in junior high english classes : by taking the most unoriginal story ever told -- the end of the world -- and then changing one factor does not make it original . it 's the same as replacing humans in the end of the world with animals and calling it original . even then , infertility is n't an untouched subject by any means . - original ? thought provoking ? neither . second , nothing happens in this movie . from opening to close , you see the same thing over and over again . they go from one angry mob to another angry mob ; from one house to another house . even then , the pacing is so ridiculously slow i was ready to fast forward because all that was happening was napoleon staring . or pointless conversations . or just downright nothing , where the camera will literally sit and stare at a wall . children of men took boredom to a whole new level i did n't even know existed . - thrilling ? if shots of the wall and lame conversations thrill you , you 'll have gone in your pants 15 minutes in . as far as technical details go : there was not even half of enough violence to earn this movie an r-rating . the cinematography is hand-held and it adds a layer of realism . this realism , however , just makes the movie even more dull and boring because it 's exactly like what you could walk outside your house and see . it gives you even less of an excuse to pay attention . what hollywood and indie filmmakers both do n't understand is that what america wants is n't just another 's - scary thriller , we want something we ca n't walk outside our own houses and see . a mature fantasy , if you will . why do you think 300 did so well , while this movie failed ? because 300 was a mature fantasy , while this is just another tired `` thriller '' that does n't even have enough wind to thrill or enough intelligence to be original . i just ca n't get over the fact that nothing happened in the entire runtime of this movie . that 's why i gave it such a low score . the screenplay could n't have been longer than 20 pages , because the scenes were long but there was nothing happening in them . sure , it had a cute and different way to end humanity , but the story is so thin the average person could have thought of every detail of this movie in a coma . i think it 's movies like this that make me think originality is dead , not your big-name blockbusters . blockbusters have expectations they have to match , but it 's a sad day when indie films like this ca n't even think of something more original than this . what 's even sadder is people like you try to build it up as intellectual and amazing instead of lowering your standards so something truly original and mind-blowing can have a chance to be released . the public opinion sells , and i guess this is what everyone wants : a hideously unoriginal film that claims to be intellectual but in reality is nothing more than a paper-thin plot with paper-thin characters and less thrills than a stroll down your street . it 's your call . 0/10		1		0
i believe i 'm a pretty tolerant guy , but one thing that is really getting to me . after reading some of these reviews for various films it is this almost childish insistence that if the word ` scorsese ' , ` deniro ' , ` lynch ' or ` tarantino ' appears in the credits , the film automatically becomes a classic or it 's hidden genius at work . take cape fear for example it 's one of the worst movies ever made . the acting from all including the great deniro is appalling . all the elements of bad film making culminate in producing an atrociously poor movie . the scene where deniro is beaten with chains , iron bars , etc then just gets up and , of course is perfectly ok , beats up all the attackers . has this film become superman v or t3 , he would have had every bone in his body broken , not to mention internal bleeding but that does n't matter , this is a scorsese film , it must have a hidden genius . i wish people would watch films and give an honest impression of what they see even if their opinion is n't popular . we all have different tastes , but please do n't go into a film expecting it to be a classic then when you find it a bit boring and maybe you do n't understand it reaching the conclusion it must be brilliant because it was directed by a ` so called ' genius . if you like this you 'll probably like casino which was also terrible . by the way i do n't hate scorsese films , i think taxi and goodfellas are both excellent , but all the others are average to poor , including ragging bull -lrb- sacrilege i hear you cry -rrb- .		1		0
the gentle glow of a morning mist flows across the sea and it makes you wonder , can there be something hidden in that cloud ? that question can take a toll on your mind when it 's around midnight and a giant fog bank is now flowing across the sea onto land . the fog takes that idea , originally made by john carpenter a while ago , and remade it into a joke rather then a scary question . the fog packs one to many boring moments into a long movie that just treads on and on with no sense of horror or entertainment . young nick castle and his girlfriend elizabeth suspect their island of a hidden secret when finding a diary of one of the islands founders . the night before , a large fog bank rolled over nick 's boat and everyone except for his pal spooner is killed off . spooner gasps it was the fog but no one believes him . the truth unravels as nick discovers the island was founded by lepers , leaded by a rich man named blake , who was ambushed and attacked on the sea 's waves by the fake founders of the island . now the town is being haunted by blake and his team of ghost in the fog banks and it 's up to nick and elizabeth to save the whole town . yawn . this movie made me shed a tear . not because i was so into the movies depth and genius , but because i was bored to death . i promise you there is not one moment in this whole film that will reach out and catch your mind and make you enjoy it . the movie is so slow and badly paced that it will make you leave the movie running as you go find something else to do . none of the actors make it worthwhile . tom welling plays a younger and gentler nick castle with so little enthusiasm , you feel as though he 's going to look at the camera and ask `` where 's my paycheck ? '' maggie grace plays elizabeth who now has a purpose to be in the movie rather then jamie lee passing on through town character . she makes the role a slap dash dribble of damsel and secret holder . and we have selma blair playing the radio mistress stevie wayne who looks and sounds like she 's sleepwalking through the part with such little acting that she 's a complete mess . the special effects are alright , nothing special . the only problem is the special effects takes the mystery out of the ghost in the fog . trying to give the fog a mind of it 's own with computer generated ghost sucked . in the original , the ghost were scary because they were played by real people in solid form and you could not see their faces . in the remake , you can see the ghosts faces but can barely make out where they are standing because the frames are so cloudy and cobbled together with fire and smoke . the ghost were trashed apart in the movie , only being in it for a mere three minutes and having a newer purpose to kill . no they 're not after a stick of gold , but love . and that my friends is a pure example of changing the story and it will suck . director rupert wainwright came into this project and actually made it look like a cool movie to see but the film was a big disappointment . it crashes and blows up in the second act and can not pick up one ounce of steam to actually make it enjoying . this movie will move you . it will make you get up and move over to the tv and turn this pile of trash off . the fog gets a 1 , a complete mess and one of the worst remakes ever . john carpenter must be kicking himself for this producing choice , destroying one of his classic movies . john , let me give you some advise . do n't remake classics ! the fog = d -		1		0

man who was n't there is lost out of the gate . it 's much clearer the second time you view it . it flits between 10 different incompatible story lines , and ca n't figure out a way to develop any of them . it goes nowhere . many viewers were tricked into thinking this movie matters due to its cinematography -lrb- it looks nice -rrb- and by the authors -lrb- the coens continue to receive unearned accolades -rrb- . it 's a bunch of noir with scenes designed to kill time , not add up . it drifts and drifts and drifts . it 's a catalog of half-hearted , half-developed ideas , so it begins to feel like it 's running long after only 20 minutes . who can tell what they set out to explore ? a viewer will never figure out why it was brought into existence because the coens have not imbued it with any sense of purpose . long before burn after reading , and o brother , the coens were making movies that lacked a reason for being . it 's not detestable . it 's just all over the place . it 's a completely shapeless movie .		1		0
i know that i shouldn ` t write a review on this film , because these new horror-flicks starring perfect-looking young people are not my favorite cup of tea , but i have decided to write about it since a friend of mine made me watch this `` classic '' . the movie is about a couple of students who `` accidently '' kills a man , but he is not really dead when they leave him , because a year later the students involved get a note that says : `` i know what you did last summer '' , hence the title . the acting is so bad , its funny and there isn ` t any shock and tension in the . most of the characters are annoying , which means that you don ` t care about them when they are killed by the evil bogeyman . overall , this is a crap movie than any and fan of bad horror-movies should see . 1,5 / 10		1		0

what the hell is this thing anyway ? i am left here puzzling at how starved we must be for tentpole entertainment , not just now but for a long time , to have a whole bunch of films about intelligent apes running amok . there was godzilla at one point , night of the living dead . beyond the allegoric politics of these films that offered something to chew on , one could easily posit the mayhem in a believable world . the only stretch was to accept a giant lizard or the dead rising from graves , beyond that the ensuing destruction was carried out with a natural , unplanned dumbness driven by instincts . the sheer ludicrousness of this thing however defies belief . let 's just swallow young genius who invents miraculous cure but with unforeseen side-effects . the idea of an intelligent ape rallying his kin of regular primates around him to throw away the bonds of human oppression . in just what kind of world can a swarm of apes stomp around san francisco unnoticed ? how to solve this ? of course imbue with a a kind of supernatural speed and co-ordination that should go unquestioned because there would n't be a movie otherwise . this perfectly prefaces the final segment . the apes are suddenly super intelligent , so it makes some sense that humans would behave like primates . so set up a swat roadblock on one end of the golden bridge , then have mounted police ! storm in the firing range . have them outwitted by excellent battle tactics , wherein a bunch of gorillas push an upturned bus for cover and one of them charges against a . . dumb , ugly , preposterous . but of course it 's a movie about apes run amok , we should make some concessions , right ? so how to handle , in that light , the extremely cheesy ` human interest ' angle about father and son , maker and creation ? perhaps this is the daftest thing here , the strained emotional earnestness meant to ground this in believable world dynamics . what is the most troubling to me , is that all this has been received with mostly a straight face and a round of applause , as an example of the summer blockbuster done right . there is a movement lobbying for an oscar nod to andy serkis . the parting image is a laugh riot of unadulterated cheese . or was it meant to elicit a spine-tingling sensation of awe and beauty ? nevermind , these guys went on to give charlton heston 's epochal lines to draco malfoy .		1		0

this , of course , sucks . i do n't know why paramount would give the ok for this sequel to two other movies that were stupid anyway . jason is more of the same in this gory slasher . maybe if they made these movies without putting in much of what we 've already seen than it might have been better . maybe there is a reason why it sucks : third time is not a charm . we did n't have much fun with halloween iii : season of the witch or alien3 or leatherface : texas chainsaw massacre iii . why does the third movie in a horror series suck ? i do n't know and probably never will . the plot has jason still killing kids who just want to have sex , take drugs , and listen to rock 'n roll . what 's so wrong with that ? the 3d stuff would have been cool to see , though . friday the 13th part 3 : 3d : f		1		0

angels and demons turned out to be a movie that does n't make any sense at all . it was also very boring . tom hanks once again takes the role of robert langdon . this time , he heads to rome to prevent terrorists from using a weapon to destroy the vatican . here is where i have a big problem . the vatican clearly explained to robert that they were planning to build a new atom . they call it , `` the god atom '' or something like that . they say it 's more powerful than an atomic bomb . if they knew what they were creating was dangerous , why did they even create it in the first place ? sure , i know what you 're thinking , `` they did n't know a terrorist was going to steal it . '' well , the thing is , somebody would find out about this thing sooner or later . they would find a way to steal it and use it as a weapon . if i were robert , guess what i 'd be doing , i 'd be getting back on that plane to go back home . why did the vatican call me all the way out to rome to fix their mistake ? i 'm supposed to clean up their mess for them ? anyway , i watched this film for about a half an hour and mailed it back to netflix . most boring movie i have ever seen in my life ! i give this movie 1 star out of 10 . do n't make the same mistake i did , skip this one !		1		0
here it is . the -lrb- dear sweet god i certainly hope so -rrb- last chucky film . the last of the films , and the first that i 've truly disliked . wait , disliked ? scratch that , flat-out hated every second of . the film is a comedy more than anything else , and instead of coming up with many good jokes , as every competent comedy writer would , don mancini takes the easy way out and jumps on the bandwagon with what hollywood says is funny right now and writes just a few poor jokes and repeats them over and over ... and over . the kid thinking he 's japanese and being gender-confused , chucky killing , tiffany trying not to kill ... etc. . when exactly did tiffany turn sappy , by the way ? in the previous one , she actually yelled at a goth guy for not having killed anyone . this time , she acts like chucky was why she killed . everything about this film is just so poorly done . we 've got a kid doll that wo n't stop wetting himself ; a guy stereotype ; crude sex gags and jokes forced so far down our throat that they 're enough to make even the most tolerant person gag and a film that is basically making fun of all the earlier installments ... and i , for one , am not laughing . the plot is ridiculous . the pacing is even worse than the previous two ... it 's freaking intolerable . the acting is incredibly poor . the characters are very poorly written and all clichéd and stereotypical . about half of them are actually just there to act as victims or running gags ... or both . the dialog is immensely poorly written . the humor is awful ... the comical timing is constantly off , and the punchlines are forced . honestly , there 's just nothing in the film to make it worth watching , apart from possibly the biggest of child 's fans . i recommend this only to the very biggest chucky fans , and i advise anyone else , everyone else to avoid this , or at the very least , approach with caution . i doubt i 'll ever watch it again , and i can think of tons of very bad movies that i 've seen several times . 1/10		1		0

`` see ... pretty , dumb kids killed ! '' that 's the whole plot synopsis . you do n't even have to worry that there 's too much plot in this one . various prom attendees find reasons to go do things alone , and a killer reliably stalks and kills them . it features , rock-bottom , nonsensical scripting . in the 15 minutes before the prom king and queen are announced , two eager noms head up to their rooms to fool around . ??? i 've seen some lazy horror movies before , but this one takes the cake . everything is perfunctory , lazy and limp . it uses the clichéd mirror scare not just once , but twice . -lrb- thank you , fatal attraction -rrb- startle scares , yep we got em by the pound . the movie can spare about ten seconds of film after the killer is shot to jump to the credits . the movie goes to some length to incorporate a black couple as the white protagonists friends , and then the director , the script and the white couple treat them like garbage . this is the kind of movie you 'd make when you 've given up competing on every aspect , except style . the prom looks like it has the budget of a decent awards show . if you are in your teens and so sheltered that you do n't know your primary colors or your alphabet , this may be for you .		1		0
oh dear , eli roth , what do your parents think of your new graphic imagery torture film ? perhaps some jewish holocaust organization might like to shed some light on exactly what they think of a foul mouthed poo and scalpel jester jewish boy like you -lrb- see hostel 's ` making of ' dvd section -rrb- actually choosing to write and then film torture imagery that degrades the actors , film industry creatives and lastly the cinemas and audiences ? what is the point of hostel apart from wanting to show screaming 20somethings slashed and drilled and being physically destroyed ? what does it say about you , eli ? not anything good i suspect . like australia 's similar abomination wolf creek directed by first time movie business vandal greg maclean this is the tourists getting hacked to death imagery . maybe roth maclean and tarantino are actually the axis of evil . hostel exists for no other reason that to celebrate tarantino and roth 's delight in human mutilation imagery . like the cruel businessmen depicted in the film they perform the same act on the audience -lrb- giggling all round -rrb- . yes it makes money , but so does war . to be so young and to have already sold your soul to tarantino is the greatest horror about hostel . the fact that good young actors like jay hernandez -lrb- and heather in hostel 2 -rrb- are reduced to appearing in this ugliness is an equal disappointment . maybe to fill in his time better , some jewish holocaust organization might educate roth and pals in the value of human life , that it is not , as the nazis gleefully enjoyed , a thing to be degraded and mutilated as entertainment . apparently , according to industry paper variety , roth is ` thrilled at how gore audiences have embraced his new horror film ... '' and that `` hostel 2 will contain more graphic torture , especially on the new torture train ... '' . gee is n't that just great for the impressionable teens of tomorrow . go feed your grandmother eli , do something useful . clean your street . take some disabled children to see a real movie . one that is creative , not destructive . ... actually i just had a thought : would n't it be funny if tarantino and roth were both crippled in a car crash and had to spend the rest of their lives being fed by old jewish people in a nursing home . .		1		0
on mars , the martian 's kids are feeling rather blue , so the leader of the martians come up with a plan to kidnap santa claus from earth to bring him back with them so he can spread the christmas joy , by giving presents to their children . but also on the trip to mars are two earth children who get caught up in this mess by helping the martians find santa claus . not everyone is too happy about this outcome , as one of the martians does n't like this idea of santa spreading fun to their children , so he goes out of his way to stop that happening . what 's christmas without watching a christmas flick . but oh my what a film to pick ! i remember watching this flick a long time ago , but i did n't remember too much about it and that was definitely a good thing from what i just watched ! it is n't the worst film i 've seen , but it is n't that far away from it . ` santa claus conquers the martians ' does give the word bad , a really bad name . ah , maybe bad is too loose of word to describe it . abysmal , yeah that 's better . sure , this is aimed at children , but really there 's whole lot better christmas flicks out there ! especially since it treats you as if you 're damn fool ! there 's nothing subtle about it with you basically being slap in the face with its heavy handed nature of forced morality and force-feeding you , to where the story is heading . if you 're thinking that it might be so bad that it 's good entertainment ... far from it , actually . ed wood might be proud of it as it does share patterns to his type of work in the cheap effects , lousy costumes -lrb- except santa 's , but not the polar bear -rrb- and cardboard sets , but his films had heart by being too over-the-top , while this made in the basement production was a total drag and ultimately cold . even if there 's one or two hammy performances amongst many droll ones . that would be john call as santa claus . the christmas spirit to me came across as false and rather unsettling . yeah , unsettling . something about it and all the happiness felt unstable and just got my nerves . when they broke into that unnatural laughter and strained humour , * argh * , do n't they know their limitations in this incompetent hogwash . nice idea , but handled without any real passion and it shows by its restless nature . so , this is how to celebrate christmas ! and to think , is this feature mocking itself or being serious . ah , i think more so the latter . bah ! oh my beloved eyes and ears . why did i put you in this much pain ? other things that stand out in this uninspired trite has got to be the choreographed action pieces that just blows you away . blows you away at how amateurish they were . pretty much it 's cartoon style in its action , gags and wait the drowning music . stock footage is patched in rather elegantly ! that 's if you got bad eye sight . the diabolically lengthy script with its emotionally touching and you bloody do n't say speeches are n't helped by the mostly robotic performances . these mainly came from the kids and the aliens from mars . well more so , people who just like to wear green -lrb- because it 's logically that they be green -rrb- and have a hard hat with tubing and a tv antenna on top . gee , they looked so realistic ! it looks like it just comes second nature . be careful you do n't lose any brain cells as the catchy , but annoying opening and ending tune sticks in your head ! `` hooray for santa claus '' no , `` hooray it 's over '' sounds a lot better . expect the unexpected . but that does n't mean it 's a good thing ! oh , by the way , the martian 's stun ray really works a miracle .		1		0
as bad as `` resident evil '' was , hollywood still did n't get the message that video games make terrible films . `` alone in the dark '' is no exception , a purely tedious yawner of a creature feature . you know what you 're in for from the word go , when a narrator is required to read the opening monologue , even though the words are plainly displayed on screen . christian slater , tara reid , and stephen dorff are trapped in thankless roles as the individuals who are trying to stop the vicious beasts . there are no surprises , no scares , no suspense , no interest , and no plot to be found in this film ; an amazing waste of $ 20,000,000 which would 've been better spent making yet another sequel in the `` police academy '' series . save your money and your time and skip this one . * out of ****		1		0
season of witch -- trash it -lrb- d -rrb- season of witch is another crap out of nicolas cage . the movie starts with cruel witch hanging and then comes the man `` nicolas cage '' with some of the most stupid fake war fight sequences . from war fight till the last demon fight it was full of dreadful dialogues and performances by each male star cast . -lrb- the witch `` clair foy '' was good -rrb- . ghost rider , next , knowing , astro boy , the sorcerer 's apprentice , drive angry 3d and now season of the witch . in last decade this man has given us the most ridiculous big ventures . thanks god to national treasure series & kick-ass , which saved his rep a little . but one thing for sure casting nicolas cage in adventurous lead role is an invitation for disaster . overall , trash this ridiculous venture out of nicolas cage .		1		0
this is absolutely the worst teen movie i have ever seen , although that does not say much because i have not seen many since the nineties started , and i am a teen . the new movies are really shallow . however this movie is one of the most shallow and superficial teen romances ever . it is false , and it never makes any logical sense . i should know , i go to high school . first drew barrymore plays a shy reporter who is walked upon . she gets her first assignment to go to high school undercover and get a good story on teenagers . she is excited until she remembers high school . she was a geek , is a geek , and forever will be a geek according to the movie . the only thing about this movie is to have the , but mentally-handicapped kids accept you , you must have somebody just as moronic get you into the good crowd . drew can not play this role at all . from the first couple of scenes i wanted to kill her . i just wanted her to maybe have a reaction to the teasing , and commit suicide . that is how annoying she is . at the end of the movie , i laughed at her , because she deserved it . i wo n't tell you the ending , but you will guess it about 1/3 to 1/2 through the movie . the people i saw this with called it word for word . the school is so fake , i wish the writers had a memory lapse to excuse the falsity of this movie . first they let the students wear sport bras to school . at our school the girls can not even show their . at prom dewey goes as tom cruise from `` risky business '' in his underwear , dress shirt , and socks costume . there is also adam and eve . the girls go as a form of barbie . there are metal detectors for one scene . the school allows prom to overtake academic life . the students : according to this movie , you are either really smart or really cool . you can not be both , until josie breaks that mold , and then it is reformed . the smart people are losers who form their own clubs . the `` cool '' people are extremely dumb and do not have an ounce of intelligence or sense to them . there is no in between . also , all cool people are really mean . apparently , rob also is `` cool . '' he becomes `` cool '' by doing stupid tricks . eating coleslaw but the bucket , and acting like a moron . i wanted him to just run away . he was cool enough to survive , but dumb enough to dislike . i hoped that there would be some humor to help the movie , but i laughed at all the wrong parts . i laughed whenever josie went down , and swore whenever she was lifted . i hated her with a passion before and after her `` coolness '' hit . i would have made fun of her just because of her personality . first , see if she has anything to offer , then , if she does n't , mock her . this movie made me puke . the people i went with wanted josie , and rob , her brother , to get together . do n't see this even if you have nothing better to see , because everything is better than this . i give this - infinity out of 10 .		1		0
i swear , this movie was just an excuse for horny teenage computer nerds to get together and create what they would call a `` film '' . who frickin ' green lights these movies ?! now , i am a fan of milla 's , she 's beautiful and a very cool actress , but to be honest with all the cgi that was going on , i did n't even think she was on screen at all . this movie was a total insult to her and anyone who thought their career would take off after this film . the plot does n't make any sense and is just plain stupid . i would definitely not recommend this film for anyone who is a true movie buff . it is a waste of time and money . sorry , milla , we know you can do better . 1/10		1		0
i watched the dvd of this film on christmas eve with a bunch of friends . i 've heard so much about it and how well it was doing , i could n't wait to take a look . what a huge disappointment . it was slow , boring and predictable . sadly , it 's becoming difficult to find ` orginality ' in film year after year , so when you have something that is the same as something else , you 've got ta do the best you can to entertain at $ 10 plus a ticket , $ 4.99 a rental . i did have the mind set that i was going to watch a theme that i had seen before . what i did not expect was that i was watching a theme i had seen before from several films that were also `` so-so '' to snoozers . it was the re-hashing of already cooked hash that was n't good when it was new . maybe it 's the `` fashion industry '' . sounds like a good thing to bash since it seems pretty glamorous , treats women like objects and `` walking hangers just to see how the fabric of their design flows '' and very cut throat so based on that , it should make an interesting , through provoking story . but from many of the films i 've seen try to `` expose '' that industry , they 've been `` okay '' to down right `` boring '' . this one is one of the really boring ones . the story is the same : fish outa water girl -lrb- anne hathaway who 's 98 % of films she has done is playing this same type of role -rrb- gets job with total female tyrant over 40-year old boss -lrb- and these women have got to look as old as heck , fashionable but old - a trick from `` valley of the dolls '' -rrb- -lrb- meryl steep -rrb- who treats her like a slave , she gets in with a male gay who ` secretly ' helps her dress and ` play the game ' , she weighs her life against the work life , meets some guy her twice her age and a guy her age -lrb- pick any young actor of the moment and throw him in here -rrb- continues to question which one to , realizes she 's a slave , tries to overcome tyrant female boss , the industry and herself to realize she 's better than what she 's doing . throw in a few , -lrb- top models , runway showing , magazine covers , camera hungry designers people watching can point at and say , `` is n't that so and so ? wow ! '' some nice clothes for this time , a somewhat shallow `` i 'm being used '' ploy and you 've got `` the devil wears prada '' and 25 other films before it - except you used the name of a top line of fashion design to make it more ... sexy . what also bothered me about this film is that i caught on early that no one spoke over one line sentences and formed words over seven letters long . but ... everybody looked good , the women traded simplistic `` cat fight '' snarls , and everyone fit into their stereo-typical part nicely - so i guess that makes it a blockbuster film . `` blockbusters '' are n't like as they used to be , i guess . if you 're looking for a little depth skip this , if your looking for meaningless time to kill with folks wearing nice clothes and conversing in short cliché sentences with no thought process behind them , and you like knowing what sentence and scene is coming next , this may be your kinda film .		1		0
easily the of all the harry potter books to be made into film was the order of the phoenix . it was a book that i read at a certain milestone in my life , and to finally see it in a movie theater was a treat . however , this harry potter installment is so lackluster in story , and completely unfaithful to the source material , it is the biggest disappointment i 've had to face in the cinema since the first x-men movie . the acting is okay . radcliffe tends to go over-the-top a few times , especially near the end of the film in the department of mysteries . gambon is still a somewhat okay replacement for richard harris , though the dumbledore portrayed here is nothing like the one in the previous films . grint and watson are also treats . imelda staunton as delores umbridge is so great in her performance , that it is truly the only saving grace of the movie . the music this go around is weak . compared to the beautiful and haunting score created by john williams , the music for the order of the phoenix is anything but enjoyable or deep . michael goldenberg 's screenplay is not only weak in terms of delivering a satisfying movie with a good pace and character development , it is also one of the worst adaptations of a novel i have come across in years . omissions are inevitable , but there 's a clear line between what `` should be '' and what `` should n't be '' . the series as a whole up to this point has left out so much information , it 's no wonder why the final book has been split into two parts . the subtle stuff that leads up to the finale is completely omitted or wrongly placed in the film -- dumbledore does not explain the prophecy . sirius 's fate would be confusing to the average audience member , and the tension between characters is incorrectly written to the point where i 'm surprised no one is burning harry potter dvds instead of the books . i 'm not a purist , i just have a better understanding as to what needed to be included for the next and final -lrb- two -rrb- movie -lrb- s -rrb- . there is , also , no continuity -- they introduce the daily prophet as a device to incorporate montage sequences to make the film go by faster . the special effects are mediocre compared to the goblet of fire , and the department of mysteries is not realized to its full potential . the ministry of magic was excellent however , and nicely realized . all in all , as a fan and not a purist , harry potter has shown no magic or charm in this fifth installment , and as a story , there 's no character development , faithfulness , nor pace . this is just one big rush job . i highly do not recommend it to any fan of the books or to an average viewer . the film goes all over the place , loosing focus of what is to come in the future , all equaling to the biggest disappointment of 2007 , hands down .		1		0
simply put that is how i describe this one . none of the supermans are really great , but they are ok . this one is just awful ... i mean where do i begin . i might as well start with the budget ... it just had to be extremely low . his flying looked worse in this than in the first one . then there is the acting reeve goes beyond mediocre in this one ... here he sucks . i am guessing it was the director 's job that made him tolerable in the first three . not that anyone does a good job in this one including gene hackman who is also awful and just why did the feel the need to have jon cryer play his nephew ? then the scientific errors . somehow a strand of superman 's hair can hold up all this weight ... i think it was a ton , but lex luthor cuts it with bolt cutters . nuclear man takes a girl into space where there is plenty of air for her to breath apparently . and speaking of the villan , did they try to make him as lame as possible or what . this of course has to do with the plot , a whole movie devoted to telling us a nuclear war would be bad ... duh ! if reeve thought this movie was going to cause world leaders to say `` gee , we should n't start a war and maybe we should disarm '' , then he was fooling himself .		1		0
four unrelated vignettes involving tourists , newlyweds , and quirky locals play out in rome . the characters are neither sympathetic , likable , interesting , nor memorable . the plots are like fantasy daydreams but still manage to be incredibly tiresome . i was so glad when the movie was over . on the plus side , the photography is exquisite . rome is filmed in a warm , golden light that makes it look like a fairytale city for lovers . some very good actors get stuck with trite material and woody allen is still playing the same loser character he 's been doing for forty years . terrible movie .		1		0
the problem with movie adaptations to video games is often the same : you do n't get to play . this thing really looks like a fun video game , really too bad it 's actually a movie . they did n't even bother to come up with a plot for the occasion . there 's like , money , and people start fighting because they want it . i guess . cue game footage , menus and all . the director tries to keep everyone awake with some really weird camera trickery and a pumping techno soundtrack , and that actually works for thirty seconds or so , too bad the movie is quite a lot longer than that . of course the tired old action clichés show up too . of course someone ends up doing multiple flips in mid-air , of course the ending is our heroes jumping out of an exploding building just in time . i mean , duh . it 's pretty amusing that the villain is eric roberts , i 'll give it that . now to get rid of that headache .		1		0
tim -lrb- barry watson -rrb- , twenty-three years old and a successful editor for a magazine , is scared of dark closets and cupboards , because , as a child , he saw his father pulled into a wardrobe by the boogeyman . when tim 's mother dies , he returns to the family home , where , once again , he finds that the creature that likes to lurk in dark places is still up to his old tricks . boogeyman begins in exactly the same way as monsters inc. : with a frightened boy cowering in bed , imagining that everything in his darkened room is a monster . unlike monsters inc. , however , this supernatural tale from producers robert tapert and sam raimi -lrb- of evil fame -rrb- is a load of old toss ! utilising a vast array of pointless visual gimmickry , and relying on an annoying amount of cheap scare tactics to keep its audience from nodding off , boogeyman is yet another bland hollywood horror which concentrates on delivering style over substance , winding up resembling an mtv music video in the process . towards the end of the film , director stephen t. kay gives up on any pretence that he knows what he is doing , and lets loose with a barrage of really bad cgi effects in a finalé so utterly awful that i wince just thinking about it : after flying through all kinds of doorways , tim counts to 6 , hits a toy bird with a baseball bat -lrb- turning it into a flock of real birds -rrb- , smashes a spherical electric plasma lamp , and breaks his action man figure , thus destroying the objects that have caused his fear and , consequently , the creature . easy when you know how !		1		0
totally abysmal film . brian has given us far better work that actually made sense . this is utterly ridiculous , and i 'm being polite . you would think that a middle east shooting at the film 's beginning had something to do with the arab-israeli conflict . you would think that there is going to be a terrorist plot . there is terror all right , but the picture quickly descends into a telekinetic nonsense , with 2 teenagers , andrew stevens and amy irving needed due to their psychic powers . we never are told the organization that wants them and what they have intended for them to do . instead , we are subjected to wild chase scenes , and the kids using their psychic powers to cause all sorts of mayhem . when the bleeding starts , you know you 're in for it . the bodies begin to pile up dramatically as just about everyone meets a horrible death . horrible best describes this film .		1		0
* anna faris , regina hall , craig bierko , charlie sheen , carmen electra , -lrb- voice over by james earl jones -rrb- . directed by david zucker tired out and seemingly half baked comedy -lrb- who knew -rrb- that fails to go anywhere further than a dick and fart joke but even then the punch line is never fully delivered . the fourth installment to the `` scary movie '' series which again takes david zucker to direct it , who was a member of zaz and abrahams -lrb- also member -rrb- wrote it . this certainly is not zaz as i recall but far from it as zaz took over idiotic humor with `` airplane ! '' and `` naked gun '' . which ironically also stars leslie nelson , who plays the dimwitted president that just ca n't get anything right `` scary movie 4 '' focuses on tom ryan -lrb- bierko -rrb- who is a knuckle head and teams up with again cindy campbell -lrb- faris -rrb- and her thought to be dead friend brenda -lrb- hall -rrb- who together have to stop an alien invasion . the lackluster comedy pokes fun at `` war of the worlds '' , `` saw '' , `` brokeback mountain '' and `` the village '' . lets hope they are smarter than this movie and do n't come back for a fifth installment and if they do at least have some courtesy to make it r-rated .		1		0
i do n't know what the big fuss is about american beauty . its one of those movies that virtually shouts at the screen , `` i 'm an epic gim me an oscar '' . very much like driving miss daisy . `` i 'm an old lady gim me an oscar '' . or maybe even boys do n't cry . `` i showed my breasts on screen gim me gim me gim me '' . whats more , american beauty also tries to suck so much sap out of you , you 'll be blowing your nose with a pancake . the `` plastic bag blowing in the wind '' scene was another pathetic attempt at winning an oscar . there were so many better movies that year that should have won an oscar , or even the best picture , -lrb- american psycho , dogma , fight club -rrb- . not much can be said about the acting . kevin spacey 's skeptical portrayal was overrated it did n't deserve the oscar . the rest of the acting was bland , basic and with bad range . annette bening was probably the only good actress , although geena davis or stowe would also have done well for the part . the films only saving grace is its directing and soundtrack which are very good but the movie did n't deserve all the credit it received . 6.6 out of 10 .		1		0

i realize several ben stiller movies are out or will be out this year , but perhaps he should insist on quality , not quantity . i was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in `` along came polly . '' stiller 's reuben is grating , charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year . stiller 's schtick is getting tiresome . he undoubtedly has comic talent , but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break , find some material that is actually funny . because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad . there 's absolutely no chemistry between stiller and jennifer aniston , which is a shame because she 's a good , smart actress with a promising career . as long as she keeps making more movies such as `` the good girl '' -lrb- in which she 's terrific -rrb- and less like `` along came polly , '' she 'll have a career of which she could be proud . aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she 's working , but it 's a daunting task for any actress . with the exception of a few moments with alec baldwin , as reuben 's boss stan , and philip seymour hoffman , as reuben 's best friend sandy , there 's nothing funny in this awful film . other supporting characters , including debra messing as lisa and hank azaria as claude , are annoying . azaria 's accent is not only stupid , it 's terribly unfunny . the premise of `` along came polly '' certainly showed promise . unfortunately , it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy , instead of this lame , dull , boring excuse for a comedy .		1		0

what a lousy , boring picture . jude law was horribly miscast in this civil war yarn . nicole kidman pulls out all the stops to emulate scarlett o'hara but does not and renee zellwegger gives a performance that i quite did not understand . the best supporting actress winner spoke like she had marbles in her mouth . that combined with her southern drawl made her impossible to understand . ca n't fathom that kathy baker recovered so quickly following the horrible massacre of her husband and sons . they ought to use miss baker as a grieving counselor in a public high school . nice job of getting back to yourself quickly , miss baker , but it was inappropriate . jude law appeared to be able to survive anything in this grim civil war tale . i could n't wait for him to get back to ms. kidman so that this darn movie could end . the civil war battle scenes ca n't match atlanta in `` gone with the wind .

samuel l. jackson does n't know how to give a bad performance , but his choice of movies raises some questions . `` wicker man '' director neil lebute 's suburban crime thriller `` lakeview terrace '' qualifies as a predictable , pg-rated melodrama that draws its inspiration from a real-life case of racism where an african-american cop harassed interracial couples in los angeles . this disposable , depressing , one-dimensional character study in villainy casts jackson as a 28-year veteran of the los angeles police department who does n't cotton to his new next door neighbors , a twentysomething interracial couple without a clue . for the record , `` hancock '' star will smith sank some of his dough into this heavy-handed hokum . chris -lrb- patrick wilson of `` hard candy '' -rrb- and lisa mattson -lrb- kerry washington of `` ray '' -rrb- have just bought their first house . chris manages a grocery store and lisa sits around the house drawing pictures when she is n't forgetting to take her birth control pills . she wants a child to mellow out her racist father harold -lrb- ron glass of `` barney miller '' -rrb- who did n't approve of her daughter 's decision to marry a white bread yuppie . movies have come a long way since the 1967 classic `` guess who 's coming to dinner '' where sidney poitier married a white girl . ashton kutcher and bernie mac appeared in the abysmal remake `` guess who '' that reversed everything so that white guy kutcher could wed black girl zoe saldana . everybody got along in these classic as well as movies . no sooner have chris and lisa moved in than they aggravate single-parent cop abel turner -lrb- samuel l. jackson of `` pulp fiction '' -rrb- who does n't take kindly to their liberal-minded antics . abel raises teenager daughter celia -lrb- regine nehy of `` pride '' -rrb- and young son marcus -lrb- tv actor fisher -rrb- without the benefit of a mother . abel reveals later to chris that his wife died in a traffic accident under suspicious circumstances that he has n't quite reconciled himself to three years later . abel rules his kids like a tyrant . not only does he correct celia 's grammar at the breakfast table but he also reprimands her for wearing her ipod every waking moment . similarly , he does n't cut marcus any slack . not surprisingly , both celia and marcus are overjoyed when they get a break from dad to spend time with a relative . meanwhile , abel explains to his green , hispanic partner javier villareal -lrb- jay hernandez of the `` hostel '' horror flicks -rrb- that he moved his family out of the troubled ghettos where he grew up so that they would have a better life . abel keeps a tight lid on his patrol area , just as most cops in crime movies do , playing criminals off against other to maintain law and order . abel has an obese white drug dealer clarence -lrb- keith of `` leatherheads '' -rrb- under his thumb and protects clarence because he serves as an informant . abel and the mattson 's get off on the wrong foot . abel welcomes chris by pulling a fake carjacking while our protagonist sits in his parked car in his own driveway listening to hip-hop music . afterward , abel advises chris that no matter how loud or how long he plays hip-hop it will never made him black . chris smokes secretly in his car because lisa wo n't let him smoke in their house . he aggravates things when he thumps his cigarette butts on abel 's lawn . abel 's blinding security home lights keep the mattsons from sleeping since they do n't have curtains . chris talks to abel but gets nowhere . things really derail because the mattson 's have a backyard swimming pool that celia and marcus would die to swim in but abel does n't want them hobnobbing with the neighbors . anyway , the abel 's kids play peeping toms one evening when chris and lisa have sex in their swimming pool . abel objects to this behavior and the incidents intensify . our heroes awaken to their car alarm , rush down to their garage , and discover the tires on their sedan have been slashed . abel discusses the situation with the los angeles sheriff 's deputies who responded to the mattson 's call and a sheriff 's deputy remarks that they are lucky because they live next door to a cop . `` lakeview terrace '' shares a lot in common with the paranoid michael keaton thriller `` pacific heights . '' no matter what our heroes do , abel beats them to the punch , until his own people -- lapd internal affairs -- give him the third degree for roughing up a young african-american male , damon richards -lrb- jada pinkett smith 's younger brother pinkett of `` charmed '' -rrb- , who tried to blast abel with a pump action shotgun during a domestic disturbance at an apartment complex . internal affairs investigator lieutenant -lrb- eva la rue of cbs-tv 's `` c.s.i. miami '' -rrb- and her colleague warn abel that they are watching him . jackson smolders with rage in this combustible movie because he does n't approve of a white guy playing house with a black girl . jackson 's performance is about the only thing worth watching because his co-stars barely make an impression as a sympathetic couple that have to contend with his cruel shenanigans . indeed , the sympathetic couple are pretty boring . since the bad cop does n't have a moral leg to stand on , it is just a matter of time until he makes his fatal mistake . in other words , the short-sighted david loughery and howard korder 's screenplay boasts few surprises . loughery 's less-than-impressive writing credits include `` money train '' and `` star trek v : the final frontier , '' while howard korder has penned the tv movie `` stealing sinatra '' and `` the passion of ayn rand . '' none of their screenplays have amounted to much so it 's no surprise that `` lakeview terrace '' is such a woofer . basically , neither director neil lebute nor his scenarists have brought a shred of imagination to a potentially explosive but superficial saga . if you 've seen the trailer for `` lakeview terrace , '' you 've seen more than enough to know that this objectionable opus is worth neither your time nor your money .		1		0
george lucas , what were you thinking ?! you were the genius behind murders , star wars , and indiana jones for goodness sake ! why did you have to create a bad movie like this ?! this movie reminds me of a bad episode of goosebumps where everybody 's a duck ! how many men do you think play howard the duck ? eight . that 's right , eight men played the role of howard the duck -lrb- one did the voice and seven wore the costume on screen -rrb- . the jokes are very stupid . they all involve duck puns ! what does this movie think it is , the super mario bros super show -lrb- the difference is that this involves pasta jokes -rrb- ?! wait a minute ! did i see a female duck with no clothes on ?!! i 'm not lying , i 'm seeing duck boobs !! it 's disgusting , it 's revolting , and it 's not suitable for kids ! it 's like daisy duck getting tired of her cartoon career at disney and decides to go to an adult film industry ! and then , there 's this nerdy played by tim robbins . now i know what you 're thinking : what 's so bad about this guy ? well , first , when supposedly attempting to `` translate '' howard 's speech , he sounds like donald duck trying to speak japanese but fails to do so ! later in the movie , he speaks to howard again and goes `` . '' ?! i ca n't even understand what he 's saying ! he sounds like fozzie bear with a severe sinus infection ! and get this , he dates one of the singers . oh sure , like a girl would have the hots for a loser who impersonates donald duck failing to speak japanese and go `` '' like one of the muppets . whoever got this movie made is a real quack -lrb- no pun intended -rrb- . you must be completely stupid or high if you like this movie . bottom line : abysmal acting , idiotic humor , or no likable characters are the reasons why you should avoid howard the duck .		1		0

'' exec : those were original . original makes me uncomfortable . what 's this script about ? reiss : it 's about an american tour guide in greece -- exec : it 's set in greece ? brilliant ! `` mamma mia ! '' did boffo box office and it was set in greece . reiss : this tour guide is at the end of her tether -- exec : tether ? reiss : how about rope ? exec : that 's better . reiss : anyway , on her tour , she meets a bunch of wacky tourists and finds love in an `` unexpected '' place . exec : these tourists . do they do wacky stuff that is original ? reiss : we got boozy australians , obnoxious americans , the stereotypical american college student , the stuck-up , quarreling british couple and their moody daughter , sex-crazed spanish divorcees , the workaholic american businessman , the lonely widower -- exec : clichés . brilliant , i love it ! we can get salma hayek and penelope cruz to play the spanish women . reiss : the roles are n't that big . exec : hmm . what about the love interest ? you said the tour guide finds love in an unexpected place . reiss : he 's the greek driver of the tour bus . exec : i did n't expect that . reiss : and , get this : she does n't like him at first and believes he does n't speak english . exec : that does sound a bit like `` original '' to me . just kidding - it 's utterly conventional . great ! but he has to speak english . i do n't like subtitles . reiss : oh , he speaks english , all right . which she finds out accidentally at an `` inopportune '' moment . exec : this is getting even better . reiss : one more thing : his character 's name is pronounced . exec : ! reiss : and he has a cousin named . exec : you are a comic genius ! when can i sign the check for you ? who do you have in mind for the lead role - salma hayek or penelope cruz ? reiss : i was thinking nia vardalos from `` my big fat greek wedding . '' exec : that might hurt the box office . unless , we sell the film as `` the star of ` my big fat greek wedding ' finally goes to greece . '' speaking of vardalos , did you ever see her film , `` connie and carla ? '' i loved it ! i was thinking of remaking it . with a twist . you know how in that film the two women running from the mob are singers who have to pretend to be men ? i was thinking , how about if the two are male musicians who witness a mob hit and are forced to dress up as women and play in an all women 's band to hide from the gangsters . reiss : you mean a remake of `` some like it hot ? '' exec : some like it what ? i do n't know who to blame for the utterly bland `` my life in ruins . '' reiss , director donald petrie , actress nia vardalos or producers tom hanks and rita wilson . clearly , some of the same people involved in `` my big fat greek wedding '' -lrb- 2002 -rrb- - vardalos , wilson and hanks - are back for this one . but , whereas , that film , despite its obvious plot twists and turns , had a certain charm to it , this one is devoid of anything even remotely resembling charm , humor or originality . there 's a moment about 20 minutes into `` my life in ruins , '' when dr. -lrb- caroline goodall - what is she doing in this awful picture ? -rrb- tells georgia -lrb- vardalos -rrb- , `` you are not funny . '' she might as well have been saying that to petrie and reiss . because this film just lumbers from bad , unfunny and entirely predictable situation to the next , simply playing on conventional characters who just appear to be doing what they are doing without an ounce of emotion or genuine feeling . they merely go through the motions , hoping the gorgeous scenery will hoodwink the audience into believing they are watching something special and funny . there is n't a single moment in this film that is honestly funny or is n't telegraphed . the only barely fleshed-out character is richard dreyfuss as irv , a loud-mouthed widower who thinks he 's funny . he gets one nice moment : a brief scene with rita wilson . that moment begs the question as to why wilson does not appear in more movies . i realize her husband 's making all the big movies and is the box-office name , but she is a terrific actress and , frankly , `` my life in ruins '' would have been substantially and substantively more enjoyable had the film been about irv and elinor . vardalos might be looking to regain some of the `` magic '' of `` my big fat greek wedding . '' but she failed miserably with `` connie and carla '' -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , a `` some like it hot '' -lrb- 1959 -rrb- ripoff , and now comes this `` if it 's tuesday , this must be belgium '' -lrb- 1969 -rrb- ripoff . ` nuff already . she has to quit making duds and try something else - a drama or a thriller or , better yet , a supporting role , anything other than these crappy cookie-cutter movies in which she plays cardboard characters with a plastered smile . true , `` my life in ruins '' is inoffensive . you can take your grandparents to it , so long as they are not discerning moviegoers or have no taste . but if this is what passes for family fare these days , then that 's a pathetic statement on hollywood . and families . and if this and `` new in town '' -lrb- 2009 -rrb- are what pass for female-oriented fare , then women everywhere should feel insulted to have their intelligence questioned in such manner . at one point , irv reminds us , `` this is comedy - the greeks invented it . '' true . but what did the greeks ever do to be repaid with this sort of cloying , hackneyed tripe ?		1		0
1 . when making a sleazy little exploitation flick , do n't deliberately call to mind much better movies , such as * alien * and * the godfather * . 2 . do n't film things in slow motion when they 're unconvincing even in normal motion . 3 . do n't feel you have to cut in slow motion footage just because you shot it . see , when you have a character run up to a car , open the door , and get in the car , and the only part of that you show in slow motion is the opening of the door , it gives that action an importance which it does n't deserve , and makes you look like an incompetent boob who should n't be allowed to direct tv commercials for fast eddie 's discount house of hose clips in des moines , iowa , much less a major-studio feature film .		1		0
this horrid adaptation of c.s. lewis ' classic tale is a bland , cookie-cutter modern fantasy flick that makes shameless attempts to cash in on both christian religious dogma and horrifyingly average special effects at every turn . the british tv versions from the '80s and early '90s were almost * infinitely * better . here , edmund is more than a self-absorbed brat ; he 's also a coward . and the white witch is not scary -- she looks like she escaped from a very , * very * cheap porn film . and then there 's mr. tumnus , who , here , comes across as some kind of creepy pedophile -lrb- hey , the white witch does , too ! -rrb- . not to mention the fact that liam neeson -lrb- while a great actor -rrb- is * no * suitable aslan . then there are the battle scenes -- oh wow . these scenes make rob zombie flicks look like cinema deluxe ! throw in some poor character animation and even more * dismal * performances and you 've got yourself one insipidly * hideous * film .		1		0
if you are in the mood to torture yourself and see a piece of mind-numbingly bad cinema and be seen by pseudo-intellectuals as `` with it '' , then do i have a film for you ! you must see un chien andalou ! this is sort of like a home movie based on dreams by a psychotic sadist -- with no comprehensible plot , violent and repellent images -lrb- such as a close up of an eyeball being slashed by a razor , a severed hand laying in the street , a woman being run over , a pointless murder , etc. -rrb- . in fact , i ca n't help but think that the film 's creators , salvador dalí and luis buñuel , just created this movie as a way to laugh at intellectuals and wannabes who just ate this crap up and declared it to be `` high art '' . by the way , this film is highly reminiscent of jean cocteau 's blood of a poet -- another home movie full of really interesting images -lrb- but zero plot -rrb- that is adored by the elite . both are incomprehensible and boring films , though at least cocteau 's is harmless . plus , cocteau went on in later years to make some magnificent films , whereas dalí just seems to have gone mad and buñuel continued making movie that made everyone 's head hurt . the emperor has no clothes !		1		0
this movie was horrible . this along with 3 are the worst halloween movies i have ever seen . the movie has the original halloween survivor , tommy doyle , in it along with a few other characters . you 've got the fred flinstone , the pot-smoking son , an easily disposable girlfriend , and a few other victims . you still continue with the curse of thorn , a curse put on people so that they kill all of their family members . the only characters that worked for me was sam loomis and debra strode . sammie is hunting down michael , still . sam , just leave it up to the army or something . debra strode is there long enough to die but her character was the only one that had sense . the only good thing this movie had was the pretty cool strobe-light effect . that 's about it . the acting was ok but the screenplay was bad . very bad . the deaths were gory and stupid . even michael 's `` ending '' was stupid . overall this movie should be roasted at a bonfire or something . avoid this movie if it comes on tv and do n't dare rent it . rating 1 out of 10 .		1		0
in french , to be called a tourist at work means that you are not very productive because you just do n't care about your task -lrb- i was labeled like this by a previous boss but as she was really a pervert , i do n't think it counts and above all , this is n't the story here ... -rrb- . in all cases , for angie , 2010 was a blank year because her movies are really forgettable . `` salt '' was idiot and `` the tourist '' is n't better . now , i give my short list of disappointments : 1 -rrb- why do hollywood stars do n't let their body and look natural because the more they change , the more they are ugly ? here , deep has his face stretched like a piano wire and angie is close to anorexia -lrb- thus forbidding her new action movies like `` tomb raider '' ? -rrb- 2 -rrb- why do hollywood movies kept focusing about rich people ? i am tired to always see wealthy people , being happy with expensive clothes and jewels when they are just a little fraction of the people ? i do n't think that all american tourists visiting are dressed like deep thus i ca n't identify with the character . 3 -rrb- some facts are just plainly wrong : living in paris , you can never be stuck at the subway entrance ; if angie is so cautious to burn the paper , why does she left before its entire destruction ? i am very doubtful that a burnt paper could be used to read after . 4 -rrb- i do n't understand if the bad guy is russian or english and why as usual , his hired men are dumb and useless to execute his orders ? 5 -rrb- it 's very unlikely that the police are unable to identify the cheater -lrb- not a single picture of him ? -rrb- and it 's even more impossible that he can change his identity beyond recognition by his lover or past boss ! well , the magic of angie is fading away at fast speed . the only good moment of the movie was the song `` starlight '' performed by muse ... but as it 's at the end credits , it 's a bit too late .		1		0
in 1974 , in the glenville sanatorium in west virginia , three dangerous lunatics escape from their cell , release the other inmates and kill the doctors and staff . in 2003 , a group of college friends from the weston university rides their snowmobiles to the cabin of a friend . however , they get lost in a storm and reach the abandoned asylum seeking for shelter to spend the night . however , the three cannibal maniacs are still living in the place and they are hungry for human flesh . how can a producer put money to make garbage like `` wrong turn '' ? this question was drumming in my head while i was watching the stupidities of the bunch of friends along 94 minutes running time . for example , the lesbian afro-american girl returns to look for her bar that she lost in the snow while the three weirdos are driving their snowmobiles to hunt them down . or voting to decide whether they should save daniel that is being eaten alive by the crazies or not . the abandoned sanatorium is absolutely clean and everything is operative in the building . the survivors never grieve the loss of their friends that are slaughtered by the maniacs . but maybe the worst situation is when they overpower the sadistic loonies and a girl convinces the others to not kill the monsters that have eaten their friends `` like a fondue '' . last but not the least , the acting and the lines are very poor . my vote is one -lrb- awful -rrb- . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` pânico na 4 -- '' -lrb- `` panic in forest 4 -- bloody origin '' -rrb-		1		0
cops jimmy -lrb- willis -rrb- and paul -lrb- morgan -rrb- have been suspended for a week . jimmy wants to pay for his daughter 's wedding and to do so he needs to sell his andy -lrb- brooklyn dodger baseball player from the 1950s -rrb- first card issued by tops -lrb- baseball card company -rrb- . the card is taken in a robbery . jimmy tries to get it back . when the captain was in the process of suspending both cops he tells them : there is a good way to do police work and there 's a wrong way to do police work . the same can be said about this movie . there 's a good way to make it and a wrong way . no one listened . they went ahead anyway . the result is a complete disaster . tracy morgan is probably the biggest reason for this disaster but , let 's not let the director off this hook either . he shares a lot of the blame . morgan should n't be allowed before any movie camera , at least not with a script like this . his overacting was annoying and embarrassing to watch unless you were old . the only actors who did the right thing were the bad guys who performed the way they should have . as for willis , he just went along for the ride and he was okay , but should have known better and needs to pick partners , directors and scripts more carefully . i wanted to shut this down within the first . the silliness and nonsensical acting by morgan slowed down some and i wanted to see if this movie could save itself . it did n't . but , as i have said about many hollywood comedies , goofy and silly things are mandatory . it 's a law out there . but , this was way over the top . one more thing . the sound and any character 's mouth movements were way off too . first you see the character saying something and then later you hear what that character said . i think , but i can not be sure , that the dialogue was dubbed in after the scenes were shot . looked like it . maybe it was the dvd ... ... ... ... ... violence : yes . sex : no . nudity : no . suggestive language : yes . language : yes , many f-bombs		1		0
`` die hard 2 '' director renny harlin 's action-packed thriller `` 12 rounds '' qualifies as an absolutely awful big dumb action movie with celebrity wrestler john cena that makes the three-time wwe champ 's first film `` the marine '' appear shakespearean by comparison . predictable throughout its 108 minutes with nary a shred of suspense , this new orleans lensed actioneer lacks a single surprise . freshman scenarist daniel kunka has penned a strictly by-the-numbers potboiler . none of the high octane action scenes are either remotely memorable or believable enough to make you sit up and gnaw your knuckles . harlin and kunka carefully preserve all the appropriate clichés , such as the hero 's best friend who must inevitably bite the bullet . no matter how desperate the predicament or elaborate the obstacles , our redoubtable hero always triumphs over the opposition , even if it takes him some time to figure out the villain 's ultimate goal . mind you , john cena cuts a good figure as an action hero , but he does n't field any clever one-liners like arnold used to spout and cena 's final confrontation with the villain lacks punch . new orleans policeman danny baxter -lrb- john cena -rrb- is just another uniform until he captures high profile arms dealer miles jackson -lrb- aidan gillen -- think of him as a poor man 's richard gere -rrb- who the fbi has been dying to bust . mind you , the fbi is breathing down jackson 's neck as he heads off with an attaché case crammed with diamonds to make a deal when they lose him . baxter really lucks up when he collars the elusive jackson . of course , it would n't be sporting to reveal how jackson gives the feds the slip except to say if you 've seen enough of these thrillers , you 'll know what 's going to happen before it occurs . baxter and his faithful african-american partner hank carver -lrb- brian j. white of `` the game plan '' -rrb- receive a back-up call that the feds need their help and head out to the rescue . the wily villain switches vehicles with the help of his drop-dead-gorgeous girlfriend . in route to give the fbi a hand , baxter watches the jackson file on their cruiser 's computer and catches a glimpse of jackson 's mighty fetching girlfriend erica -lrb- beautiful taylor cole -rrb- in a picture with jackson . coincidentally , the stunning erica whips up alongside our heroes in traffic , thinking that jackson and she have outsmarted the authorities . immediately , baxter recognizes the dame and tells hank to pull her over . while hank is eyeballing at erica 's credentials , miles springs out of the trunk and blasts away at our heroes . they dive for cover , but not before poor hank takes a slug in the rump . erica jams the accelerator to the floor and jackson and she race away . neighborhood wise baxter pursues them on foot , scaling fences , invading homes , taking every short-cut he knows , and eventually manages to halt them . jackson 's bodacious girlfriend tries to lam out again and a truck out of nowhere pancakes her . wham ! she goes down dead , and the jackson is taken into custody . jackson vows to exact vengeance on baxter . sensitive guy that our hero is , baxter apologizes to jackson and points out that he never wanted to see erica die such a horrible death . jackson does n't care now about either himself or erica . he wants his pound of flesh . meanwhile , baxter becomes a media sensation for capturing jackson and is promoted to detective . a year later , jackson engineers a prison break , kidnaps baxter 's girlfriend molly -lrb- ashley scott of tv 's jericho -rrb- , and threatens to ice her if baxter does n't play a game rather like a scavenger hunt consisting of 12 rounds . think of the foot race in `` dirty harry , '' when the villainous scorpio sent harry running all over san francisco while an innocent girl died in a hole . kunka 's screenplay inserts several unimpressive high-speed chases , a runaway `` speed '' type street car , a free-falling elevator , a shoot-out or two , lots of leaping , and a spiraling helicopter crash . indeed , harlin and kunka pile on dimwitted derring do , but none of it seems remotely hair-raising and the arms dealer villain possesses minimal menace . sadly , veteran action director renny harlin , who has made a career turning sow 's ears into silk purses , blows it badly with this formulaic thriller that is never as kinetic as it needs to be . `` 12 rounds '' is n't a tenth as exciting as `` die hard 2 , '' `` deep blue sea , '' `` the long kiss goodnight , '' or `` cutthroat island . '' everything has a familiarity , and most of it amounts to nothing more than an exercise in absurdity . if you 're a wwe fan of cena , you may enjoy this kind of overwrought nonsense . cena does everything that is required of a muscle-bound hulk in one underwhelming predicament after another . truly , it is a testament to his acting skills that he does n't look any more ridiculous that harlin and kunka make him look in this outlandish clunker . the gals look incredibly sexy , but this tedious thriller has been done to death so many times before that you suspect what lies around the curve in each scene , right down to the slimy fbi agent who refuses to let jackson get away from him again . `` 12 rounds '' runs out of steam about the 6th round .		1		0
this movie is so stupid that it made me change my criteria for evaluating bad movies . previously i thought the worst movie ever made would , by necessity , also be the dumbest movie . but here we are . every frame of this is painfully & willfully rock-bottom , but somehow it still ca n't steal my `` worst movie ever made award '' from either godspell , or nothing but trouble -lrb- pick one - it 's a toss-up -rrb- . you have to give it credit though for uniqueness ; no other movie ever made focuses on such completely , unredeemably stupid people . it 's sort of a deal that filmmakers make with audiences ... not to make viewers identify with hopeless idiots at the cinema . bus stop never comes close to entertainment or art , because -lrb- a -rrb- i have a mind , and -lrb- b -rrb- the writers have not come up with a way to make the problems and low-rent dreams of hopelessly stupid people matter to thinking people . i have never seen a movie this willfully stupid in my life . neither beau -lrb- don murray -rrb- or cherie -lrb- marilyn monroe -rrb- can think . thinking , it turns out , is hard . so these ignorant characters shout and drawl their way through pointless scene after pointless scene . they 're such morons their minds ca n't fathom the abstractions we call `` priorities '' & `` delayed gratification . '' every impulse must be pursued immediately , because they are hopelessly unarmed with the intelligence to resist any urge ; shouting , coupling , marriage , speaking every limp ` thought ' that flutters through their withered brains . getting married and moving to montana was not my highest priority for the characters . but i would have become very excited to see them rush to a free sterilization clinic or hurl themselves off a cliff . this is positively the feeblest excuse to crank up a movie camera . you should be able to imprison people this stupid . absurdly , impossibly and improbably this movie gets 100 percent positive ratings on rotten tomatoes !!!		1		0
`` sunshine '' is a straightforward sci-fi with a crew of eight trying to deliver a nuclear device to restart the dying sun . everything is by the book , including the familiar `` crisis of the hour '' , and headache inducing visuals . the weakest point is the acting and lack of any character development . the astronauts look and act like they belong in a sitcom , rather than on a mission to save the earth . you know the acting is terrible when the spacecraft 's talking computer has more personality than any of the crew . the movie comes across more like a video game than a feature film . what you get is a lot of bells and whistles but zero substance , and zero entertainment . not recommended . - merk		1		0
the acting was sub-par -lrb- except for marcia gay harden and sam witwer -rrb- both who play religious fanatic and military man respectively and very well might i add . the premise of the film itself centers around a mist that forms over a small town carrying creatures from another world that begin to annihilate the residents . a small group of survivors are trapped in the local grocery store and in there they try to wait out the freak storm that has enveloped their town but slowly and surely with all civility out the window , they all begin to turn against one another . look up horror movie in the dictionary and you would probably find a poster of this film . it is horrific in every way imaginably . it is even horrific without the intention of being that horrific . i am still in shock by the ending . i cried for days . i just ca n't get over this film .		1		0
for this review , a list of good points and bad points.i 'll start with the bad . bad points : the casting choices -lrb- especially burt reynolds as boss hogg -rrb- , the acting of said badly chosen cast , the storyline , the idea of setting the film in the modern day , the direction , the editing , the soundtrack , and above all , the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that was n't that great to start with , despite it 's popularity . good points : jessica simpson in a red bikini ... ... . . that 's it ! one might make an analogy the scene where jessica simpson as daisy duke struts her way up to michael weston as enos , and asks the question , `` enos , where 's boss hogg and roscoe ? '' , in his clouded judgment , tells her where they might just as well have asked , `` enos , is this a good movie ? '' , the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes , even though in his right mind he would have said , `` no , not really . `` as good as she looked in the bikini , she could have been stark naked , and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film-making . stay out of hazzard !		1		0
the life aquatic had tremendous potential as a spoof on documentaries of the discovery channel stripe and on the older documentaries of jacques cousteau . life was distinctly unfunny . with shades of moby dick , steve zissou -lrb- bill murray -rrb- invites a long time fan who is possibly his son off on a mission to destroy a rare shark that ate a friend . because of past failures , captain zissou can no longer get funding , but the fan , possibly his son agrees to put up his inheritance to support the mission . the crew captain zissou has had working for him is so pathetic that they ca n't crack an oyster much less a joke . yet they go off into the unknown in search of the shark . will all be lost or will you sleep through the ending ? i gave this a = = = 1 = = = the lowest possible rating .		1		0
this is definitely the movie people need to see before they take `` scientology '' seriously . this is the future you buy into , folks - a battle between -lrb- vaguely african descent -rrb- aliens and -lrb- mostly white -rrb- humans , for an earth that is little more than a wasteland , following a global disaster caused by poor eugenics . oh , give us a break ! the action scenes are just so-so , but everything else about this cheap imitation for a movie is just laughably bad - and that 's the only charm in it - it is so bad it is laughable . the primary source of amusement is the -lrb- supposed -rrb- `` dialog '' - i especially like the aliens hissing at each other , it 's so , well ... meaningless . the explosions are cool . the prison scenes are stolen from every prison movie of the 1930s . whatever good is to be found here could be found - better - in the old star trek tv show . and john travolta - ! ha ha ha ha ha ! yes , a laugh riot , if you do n't take it seriously .		1		0
had to be the biggest belly flop of a move ever made ! reportedly costing a ridiculous $ 50 million to make , `` howard the duck '' crashed and burned immediately upon its release . luckily for most the damage it caused to reputations is all but forgotten some twelve years on ; but how on earth did george lucas manage to get involved in this glaring eyesore ? perhaps he was doing colleagues and writers gloria katz and willard huyck a favour , yet from the producer of the `` star wars '' and `` indiana jones '' series , this was a disastrous piece of misjudgment . lea thompson probably completely wiped her career with one foul swoop here , and if jeffrey jones ever had a promising future , it was gone after this . the only cast member who went on to better things was tim robbins , who was probably unrecognisable as the bumbling lab assistant anyway . even composer john barry wasted a perfectly good score on this film . oh , by the way , was the film really that bad ? yes ! it was a stinker ! tuesday , november 3 , 1998 - video		1		0
plot -lrb- or lack there of -rrb- : a jerky , mean spirited loser whom we are meant to embrace as an everyman protagonist -lrb- mcavoy -rrb- is plucked out of his unhappy , depressing life -lrb- which includes a crappy job with an annoying boss , a bitchy , unfaithful girlfriend who cheats on him - with his knowledge - with his douche bag ` best friend ' -rrb- by the mysterious freeman , who reveals that mcavoy 's character is the son of a highly skilled , practically superhuman assassin , for his fraternity of superhuman assassins who base their kills on mystical messages of sorts from a loom , trained -lrb- make that repeatedly beaten up -rrb- by jolie . but there is more to it than meets the eye . or not . i admit to having not read the original comic book that this was based off of , so i can only judge the film for what it is - action trash , and not particularly good action trash at that . besides the over the top absurdity , the soulless clichés , the plot holes and ridiculous ` action ' scenes , there 's not one single likable character in all this mess . as i stated before , the main character played james mcavoy is a mean spirited jerk from the get go , and by the end of the film he is no better personality wise than he was before . yes , it is established that he 's had a crappy life , but that alone does not redeem his inherently unsympathetic behavior throughout the film . even anti-heroes need to be vaguely likable in some way , and mcavoy 's wesley simply fails at that . angelina jolie sleepwalks through her role as the sexy assassin who takes mcavoy under her wing , and both she and morgan freeman deserve better than this . how freeman even allowed himself to get involved with this nonsense is a mystery -lrb- good thing he was also in `` the dark knight '' around the same time -rrb- . to call the film style over substance would be an insult since the ` style ' is so poor it does n't begin to hide the lack of substance . you 'd be better off watching `` lethal weapon '' or `` 48 hours '' .		1		0
another popular film that to me is simply awful . this was supposed to be funny , but was just plain silly . badly written , but could have been an ok film had it been done slightly more seriously . i know it was meant to be a comedy , and that is ok . however , it just did n't play as written . really abysmal . 1 star .		1		0
why the heck is this considered a good flick ????? they said third time ; s the charm , but it 's not !!!!! `` boring monday '' with lizzie and amy bee is the worst of the three versions !!!!! and why do people think of this as such a terrific flick ?? / ?? there should be old stuff at the top of the disney list , like ducktales , treasure of the lost lamp , beauty and the beast , the lion king , angels in the outfield , and the honey i movies , not terrible unmoral flicks such as these !!!!! ther 's evil spots , , out , and bad lessons for today 's youth to face !!!!! wy ????? and worse , it uses that boring `` so happy together '' oldie by the turtles as the theme going !!!!! so sty far , far away from such a train wreck and watch the old versions and the other movies mentioned above !!!!! hey , that ducktales movie i mentioned was a good movie ; at least ti does n't have that a boring moldy oldie to go with it !!!!! lol		1		0
2 days in the valley -lrb- 1996 -rrb- was another one of those lame pulp fiction clones that came out during the -lrb- -rrb- time period . just because quentin tarantino managed to play the blind squirrel who found an acorn and a surprise hit with pulp fiction -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , everybody and their mommas decided to make a plethora of pulp fiction wannabes . hey people , like the highlander there can only be one . the director decided to write some so called `` hip '' dialog and a bunch of neurotic and quirky characters , throw in some blood and a bunch of foul language and viola ! i did n't like it then and i do n't like it now . the director seemed like he was throwing whatever he could at the wall to see if anything would stick . the film also made me angry , and when that happens no good review for you ! if you happen to like bad pulp fiction knock-offs you 'll eat this crap up . others need not apply . were bad years for hollywood films because everyone was either trying to imitate pulp fiction or watching one too many hong kong films and trying to emulate them . what happened to being original ? not recommended .		1		0
<< < spoilers ahead >> > god do i hate moulin rouge , why well here is why ? the story is set in paris as a man played by ewan mcgregor falls in love with satine played by nicole kidman -lrb- who i swear must be related to amy adams i always think there alike -rrb- who is a duchess and is hiding a terrible secret -lrb- oh and you will be shocked to find out what it is once we 're finished -rrb- and is caught in some sort of love triangle with another guy . so mcgregor 's charcther poses as a duke so that he can be close to satine . they sing songs that we all know by heart including all you need is love , a bunch of melodies and the nice song come what may which was a very good original song . but my only problem with this film is the actual ending and -lrb- actually -rrb- the whole thing . the songs come out of nowhere , the story is so thin , the effects are good though , but i just do n't buy into it for a reason . also like i said before the ending was so depressing and a bit of a letdown , i mean they killed of nicole kidman 's charcther with a lung disease what the hell , and we were made to believe that mcgregor 's charcther and kidman 's charcther were going to live happily ever after after the showcase with their song `` come what may '' in the end and before kidman died , we were made to believe that she was going to be shot and then all of a sudden she just could n't stop breathing and she fell off in a weakness and died peacefully in mcgregor 's arms in the end . seriously !?!?! what the hell were they thinking of doing that to the audience . the whole movie is just a joke and a piece of utter and complete garbage . the script is horrendous , the acting sucks , the music sucks , everything sucks in this movie . i guess me and doug walker from the nostalgia critic are n't its cup of tea . my advice go out and rent something that 's not bad like if you really love musicals go ahead and watch that timeless classic grease at least that was good and had its own original songs compare to this piece of crap . 1/10		1		0
ho boy , where to begin ? at this point in the series , dr. loomis has become abusive , the characters are all hateful , michael 's slipping , and the scripts are making even less sense . we begin right where we left off from halloween 4 , a la halloween i and ii : michael escapes from the mine shaft , crawls to safety , and gets nursed back to health by some random bum with a parrot . one year later and with a lot more energy , his immediate action once he 's able to move is to off the bum and head back to town , hoping to hunt down his niece who now has a psychic connection with him . a troop of teenagers are introduced , and the movie promises carnage . sort of . this movie is bad . by bad i mean incompetent on pretty much every level . in horror movies , part of the delight and part of the terror is the fact that the teenagers die , but one character at least we hope will live . not so in this one . every single character is a hateful , stereotypical 80s idea of idiocy , and michael 's carnage ca n't come soon enough . this storytelling is backed up by probably some of the worst editing and directing i 've ever seen , as characters move sporadically through jump cuts to ... well , they do n't really do much of anything , except ignore the warnings of a traumatized little child with a psychic connection to a serial killer . that role is given over to donald pleasence 's dr. loomis , who somehow still has a practice and still is listened to , despite the fact that at this point he breaks about every rule of clinical ethics and the fact that he 's an obnoxious jerk . breaks every rule ... that 's what this movie does . this movie is so unable to bring actual horror , suspense , or gory delights to the fore that it literally just bumbles around hoping for something to photograph until michael comes around , and then the storyline and directing are so incompetent they ca n't even make michael seem cool . the scenes in the barn are pretty much must-see for film students who want to know exactly what not to do . and then , as if it 's not enough , the movie has the audacity to introduce a new character for the sole purpose of letting michael out of prison ... who he is , what he 's there for , what he knows , even if it 's a he ... there 's no explanation . they literally wrote a character into the script because they were too lazy to know how to end this movie . that 's like the single basic screenplay no-no . of course , there 's always room for camp , but camp only works when the film goes in outrageous directions and does things creative and fun . this movie is n't even creative enough to come up with crazy , out-there ideas like halloween 3 , it just lazily serves the tropes of its genre without even the craft and skill required to make a successful continuity cut ! by the time this movie ends , you will feel frustrated , bored , betrayed , and uninterested . while this movie plays , you will wish for every character to die just so that you no longer have to watch their stupid , mindless antics , and you will regret renting -lrb- or buying -rrb- the disc . halloween 5 is n't even worth the plastic it 's printed on , and that 's bad considering how cheap it is to put things on dvd . -- polarisdib		1		0
this movie is a saving private ryan rip-off . it 's one man 's quest to save another person , from what , we are never told - but why bother with details ? the violence is so graphic , and frequent , it must consume half the movie ! to be perfectly honest i left the theater feeling bored and empty ! i was also incredulous : where 's the story ? at least saving private ryan had a beginning , middle and end . this mockery of a sci-fi film had virtually no beginning or end - it felt like one overly long chapter of a book taken out of context . not my idea of good story telling ! i can only speculate this film is doing so well in the united states because a large segment of the american public enjoys watching scenes of incredible violence and destruction . i 'm tired of it ! it 's dreary , monotonous , and annoying ! we have enough butchering going on in the real world that i do n't need to pay to watch it , too ! what makes this movie so incredibly sad is the waste of such outstanding acting talent ! do n't actors , and their agents , bother to read the scripts before they sign on ? if top acting talent started saying no to junk , then junk would be harder to sell to the movie-going public ! what messages are the viewer left with while watching this godforsaken movie ? the human race will go barren for no apparent reason . the entire world , except great britian , -lrb- for some strange reason -rrb- , will be reduced to savagery . the british government that does survives will , of course , be fascist . those who oppose the government will have to be terrorists . the good guys are so few , there 's only a handful of people willing to save the last child on earth . people become terrorists because , `` they just want respect ! '' -lrb- how touching , i never knew terrorists had such sensitive feelings ! -rrb- the good guys come out of the blue , and you will know absolutely nothing about them , except they know how to pilot a large boat . people die constantly from stray bullets . -lrb- then do n't stand-up while the shooting is going on silly ! -rrb- so many people die in this film , it becomes an art form : how many different ways can people possibly fall down in the same movie ? it must set some sort of record ! i repeat ! this is not sci-fi ! this is a war film , geared to teenage boys and young men . if you want to see really powerful & intelligent sci-fi then let your fingers do the walking over the internet and purchase -lrb- not in any special order -rrb- : 1 . zardoz , 2 . soylent green , 3 . beneath the planet of the apes , 4 . silent running , 5 . enemy mine , 6 . light years -lrb- by rene laloux -rrb- , 7 . fantastic planet , 8 . final fantasy - the spirit within , 9 . artificial intelligence -lrb- a.i. -rrb- , 10 . bicentennial man , 11 . -lrb- for comic relief ! -rrb- . while taste in film is personal , like any art , these eleven films , seen together , could change a person 's life !		1		0
the genre does n't get any more silly as the years go by , that 's for sure . this is as bogglingly incredible as poseidon adventure or towering inferno or jurassic park or the director 's own independence day . obviously there 's no point in going to any of these movies for insights into human relationships , but emmerich 's work in this respect is more embarrassing than most . there 's more characterisation in halloween than there is in this movie . this is weird , since there are some very good actors on show . they all but one sink without trace not because of the dominance of special effects but because the parts they are playing are just sooooooo corny . somehow , ian holm manages to keep his head above the rising waters . maybe a film with amazing special effects has to trade in cardboard cut-outs , but i 'm sure that lord of the rings managed to avoid it a lot of the time , especially with gollum . there 's nothing remotely resembling the power of that character here . emmerich is not in peter jackson 's league , or anywhere near it . there 's nothing as scary as spielberg 's t-rex from jurassic park . there 's nothing very much at all , i 'm afraid . get someone to wake you when nyc gets into cold water , and then go back to sleep again .		1		0
i was online checking out free , 100 % legal public domain movie downloads when i stumbled upon the movie that is `` santa claus conquers the martians . '' i 've watched this movie from the beginning to the end , and while some parts may not be as good as other fantastic holiday movies like `` santa with muscles , '' `` elf , '' `` home alone '' and others , the story is completely original : martian kids from mars are bummed out because santa claus could only be seen on earth tv . suddenly , he is found his way into outer space ! now , i think that this is an okay movie , but i 'm giving this a `` 1 '' because this was a `` mystery science theater 3000 '' film , and they are all bad in real life !		1		0
demi and woody are married , but they 're poor . they meet robert redford , and he 's really rich . he takes a fancy to demi , and since he 's a gambling man he makes the couple an `` indecent proposal : '' one million dollars for a night with the little woman . at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep . of course demi is going to accept the offer . if she does n't there 's no first half of the movie . of course it will affect demi and woody 's marriage . if it does n't there 's no second half of the movie . and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll . if it does n't , there 's no happy ending for the sake of box office . the absolute best thing you can say about indecent proposal is that demi moore looks good in a black dress . as for the rest ... the script is incompetent , the direction amateurish , the performances negligible . i suspect redford , moore , and harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned . do them -- and more importantly yourself -- a favor . unless some one offers you a million ... miss it ! gary f. taylor , aka gft , amazon reviewer		1		0
anything from the apatow stable is devoutly to be avoided by anyone with a sense of humour . humour involves irony and social commentary , qualities entirely lacking in the apatow opus . apatow enjoys laughing at the idiot goyim and giggling about it all the way to the bank . in apatow comedies , the joke is on the audience . stepbrothers is more of the same . two grown men try to do more inane things than each other while acting like nine year-olds . at some point will ferrell is sitting on the toilet with his drawers down . he reaches for toilet paper -lrb- so we know that he has had a bowel movement -rrb- and finds the roller empty . looking round , he notes the rug that surrounds the pedestal and pulls it up . he is about to turn and wipe his rear with it when -- click ! -- i switch off the dvd player and the further adventures of these two morons will never be known .		1		0
slumber party massacre -lrb- 1982 -rrb- min . d : amy holden jones . michelle michaels , robin stille , michael villella , debra deliso , andree honore , gina mari , jennifer meyers , joseph alan johnson , brinke stevens , rigg kennedy , jean vargas , anna patton , howard . originally scripted as a spoof of teen slasher flicks , the producers scratched that idea and filmed it with serious intentions . big mistake ! a horrendous , relatively bloodless excuse for a slasher film -lrb- even by slasher standards -rrb- has way too many false scares , horrid acting , inane dialogue , and is extremely slow . the ` plot ' concerns a psycho , armed with his electric drill , out to crash a high school slumber party . this film has a reputation of being the best of its kind , but that distinction goes to sorority house massacre , not this shlock . rating : 1 out of 10 . rated r for graphic violence , grisly images , profanity , sexuality , nudity , adult themes .		1		0
my brother was laughing at the terrible dialogue and the dull action throughout the movie , but virus wore very thin with me . the movie is garbage pure and simple and it is a waste of time writing about how pathetic this piece of dirt was to watch . thing is on ship , wants to take over world and many people die trying to stop it . sutherland is not so much a ` dominant actor , ' anymore , let alone a ` dominant life form . ' funny how the suits the females wear are pretty tight fit . what was everyone thinking ? what a waste of film spent on such a disaster . this movie sucked . you may laugh but be honest .		1		0
marty was the loser whom everyone made fun of in high school including joanna , her soon-to-be sister in-law . in marty 's opinion , joanna ruined her life in high school . so the thought of having a sister in-law that was your enemy in high school freaked marty out . she tries everything to get her brother to realize that joanna is n't who he thinks she is . doing everything in her power including destroying her brother 's wedding and breaking her brother -lrb- literally -rrb- , marty , of course realizes that she did the wrong thing . in the end , they get married and lived happily ever after . from the start of the movie , we see they all hated one another and by the end , predictably they made up . the so-called comedy is so dull for the most parts , that only the scored giggles . the almost laughter that was probably the highest this comedy can get is between betty white and cloris leachman near the end . you again 's characters are obviously popular , but like the characters themselves , the movie gets old with the predictable story and cheesy dialogue . : worst actress -lrb- kristen bell -rrb- , worst picture , worst screenplay -lrb- if they have this category -rrb-		1		0
a very poor horror film based on a very good stephen king short story -lrb- called `` night shift '' -rrb- . basically it 's about huge , killer rats . this one is about one huge killer rat -lrb- with wings no less -rrb- . the story is dull , all the actors sucked -lrb- only brad dourif went on to any type of a movie career after this -rrb- and the monster looked as fake as it was . i caught this little fiasco at a first run theatre back in 1990 . the place was crawling with high-school kids -lrb- despite the r rating -rrb- . they were quiet at the beginning but then they started to get restless and yell things and/or laugh at the screen . when the monster was seen in full view the entire audience exploded with laughter . mind you , these are 14 and 15 year olds ! an absolute waste of time and money . a definite one to avoid . read the king short story -- you 'll be much better off .		1		0
when embarking to watch a film with the reputation and star power this one purports to employ , you expect to enjoy , or at least respect it . so , one questions oneself when viewing and absolutely abhorring the picture - there must be something wrong with me . not so , friends . the movie is just dreadful ! how can this be ? a movie boasting sean penn , john travolta , nick nolte , john cusak , george clooney , woody harrelson , and a host of others should be good , right ? well , one way to ruin it is to have most of this power cast appear on screen in little more than cameos . another is to have no script or coherent story . then , have nearly all the characters either appear as trembling hysterical cowards , or carrying out insane heroics . also , use plenty of narrations and express lots of anti-war sentiments . for good measure , throw in many silent flashback scenes of one gi intimately interacting with his attractive and compliant wife . and when you do have dialog , make it inane and entirely nonsensical -lrb- sgt : `` i 'm gon na make you a . '' soldier : `` i can take anything you can throw at me . '' -- huh ? -rrb- you should also have the ` tropical ' terrain look like the of iowa . the thin red line is a tapestry of snooty artsy intentions and that runs on seemingly longer than the guadalcanal campaign itself , and is no less painful to endure . i am more than halfway through it , and i am withdrawing from this beachhead and leaving it to its occupiers . be kind to yourself and skip this one altogether !		1		0
a few very rich people and a great many very talented people , not least snr . leone , invested a great deal of time , talent and moolah to bring this movie to completion . it shows , and the movie is a rich spectacle - but nothing more . no-one should waste their time watching this except to learn how to on art direction . i just want four hours of my life back . naively , i sat through endless period , gratuitous sex and violence , dubious ageing makeup jobs , unrealistic dialogue and nondescript music , hoping that the ending would tie it all together in a satisfying way . epic fail . it 's a bad b-movie plot dressed as the sting . * spoiler * noodles -lrb- de niro , wasting his prime - the ridiculous name of the protagonist says it all -rrb- returns to new york after 30 years to find he has been advanced a million bucks for a hit , but why ? it 's max , -lrb- james woods -rrb- his boyhood gang chum that he thought he 'd double-crossed and got killed , wanting noodles to kill him before the real baddies get hold of him . what rubbish ; after all , a million buys a lot of secret hideaway . it is so telling that the movie 's premise considers a huge sum of money a good enough maguffin to hang a four-hour marathon melodrama on . mild , ostentatious tedium follows - mystified , noodles wanders from mausoleum to left luggage office to dancer 's dressing room , all the while flashing back to a squeaky-clean 1930 's gangland , where we eventually learn that it is a bad idea to call max ` crazy ' . because instantly he goes crazy , in a piece of character development that probably had the scooby-doo writers looking to their laurels . that was said of ` bugs ' moran , actually - you did n't call him ` bugs ' to his face . there 's no chance of any such real-life wit or irony in this script . no chance of any reality at all , because the intention seems to have been to make grand opera , so it does n't matter that a man can be forced to sit in a vat of gasoline -lrb- and drink it -rrb- yet jump out when rescued as though it were gameshow gunk . it does n't matter that driving a car at speed into a quay with no-one wearing belts would result in a bloody mess , not male bonding . grand opera requires grand passion to drive the plot ; noodles ' only passion is for looking at length through one of the movies ' two terribly unconvincing peepholes at a budding ballet dancer , whom he goes on to rape . as you do ; another piece of meaningless . grand opera requires grand symbolism to resonate with people ; there is no symbolism in ouatia , the whole thing is a completely pedestrian display of directorial indulgence . but then , in 1984 we all thought the money would last forever . this movie certainly feels like it .		1		0
tarantino 's third casting choice jamie foxx plays django , a freed slave on a quest to rescue his woman from a plantation owner played by dicaprio . the aim of the movie is to satirize the spaghetti western and blaxploitation film and the way to achieve this , apparently , is to botch the entire thing as humanly possible as to make the end result so unwatchable , no one in their right minds could offer a serious critique anymore . the film consists primarily of intentionally bad shoot-em-up scenes , superfluous dialog , outrageous yet totally unwitty cinematic clichés , lousy editing and ridiculous cameos . the soundtrack has to be heard to be believed . the heap of adolescent nonsense tarantino has been writing/directing over the last decade or so fails to meet any expectations one might have had after seeing pulp fiction almost 20 years ago . quentin 's films have been so consistently and distinctly inferior compared to that masterpiece , they can hardly be considered disappointments anymore .		1		0
-lsb- contains big spoilers !!! -rsb- meet glen . a kind , gentle creature who would n't harm a fly . i say creature because that 's what glen is : he 's a live doll ! he lives in england and performs on stage with his cruel master . glen has been having horrifying dreams about brutally murdering people . glen wanted to know who he was and where he came from . he had a made in japan insignia on his arm so he figured he was japanese . meanwhile in america , a man dressed as santa claus trudged through a graveyard . that 's when suddenly , the demonic killer doll chucky , and his tantalizing peach wife , tiffany , attacked the santa with knives . that 's when the director called `` cut '' . yes , this was all a movie . do n't worry , kids , santa is n't dead . hollywood was current filming a new movie called chucky goes psycho , based on the brutal murders caused by chucky and tiffany 6 years ago . the star of the film was jennifer tilly . she had become a compulsive eater and was tired of being typecast . she wanted to play the virgin mary in the upcoming biblical movie from redman . she went to see redman later on , and he turned her down . meanwhile across the atlantic , glen saw the chucky and tiffany dolls from the movie on tv and he saw the made in japan insignia on chucky 's arm so he knew those were his mother and father . so he fled his cruel master and journeyed to america . glen is delivered to the movie studios in the prop room where chucky and tiffany lay . glen pulled out the heart of damballa , an amulet his mother had give him long ago . he recited a chant which brought chucky and tiffany to life ! as soon as they found out they were parents , they had different reactions : chucky fainted and tiffany was simply aghast . suddenly , in came the . he started to operate on tiffany , but that 's when chucky grabbed a trip wire and together with tiffany , brutally disemboweled the prop man . glen watched in horror . jennifer tilly came in at that moment and saw the murder . she fled a media circus and went home with her chauffeur , stan . at home , jennifer was determined to star in redman 's new movie so she invited him to her house that night and planned a romantic evening . chucky , tiffany and glen followed jennifer home and right then , tiffany decided to swear off killing for the good of glen . of course chucky said it was out of the question . so while jennifer and redman talked and tiffany tried to kick her addiction , chucky took glen for a guy 's night out that involved stealing redman 's car and knocking britney spears off the road and brutally murdering a nosey reporter . at the tilly house , tiffany found she just could n't kick her addiction and slayed redman . not only that , but she had jennifer tilly artificially inseminated . it was all part of a plan where chucky and tiffany take over redman and jennifer 's bodies . the baby body would be for glen . tiffany wanted glen to be a girl while chucky wanted a boy . chucky and tiffany tie up jennifer tilly and prepare the ritual . that 's when they each discover their secret murders . they fight , and tiffany says she 's taking glen and leaving chucky . chucky was enraged . nobody leaves chucky . that 's when jennifer 's assistant , joan , stopped by . chucky was about to stab her when tiffany set her on fire . only it was n't tiffany , it was a psychotic , gender-confused glen in a blonde wig ! pretty soon , jennifer 's pregnancy , -lrb- which really sped up due to it being a voodoo pregnancy -rrb- began to act up and the baby was coming ! it was twins : a boy and a girl . pretty soon the police arrive . jennifer is taken to the hospital . tiffany and glen had followed . tiffany performs the body switching with jennifer and that 's when chucky showed up and axed tiffany . the still psychotic glen picked up the axe and completely his father . five years later , jennifer lived happily with her new children , glen and glenda , but the spirit of tiffany seemed to live on , and so did the spirit of chucky . glen found that out the hard way when he opened a birthday present from an anonymous person . my overall opinion : disappointing ! i was very disappointed with this movie . seed of chucky was not very good at all . there was endless and mindless blood and gore , and no story at all ! the story stayed in one place and did n't move . it was , bar none , one of the most disgusting movies i 've ever seen . the deaths of the prop man , john waters , and joan were unbelievably gory and sick . whatever happened to chucky 's old fashion stabbings ? jennifer tilly returns as the voice of tiffany , as well as plays herself as a stuck-up slut . brad dourif is back as chucky . nobody could portray chucky but he . billy boyd is the voice of glen/glenda . also in the cast are redman , john waters and `` britney spears '' : nadia dina . this is the fifth film in the child 's play movie series . part 1 was okay , part 2 was the best , part 3 was pretty bad , and part 4 : bride of chucky was good . now , part 5 : seed of chucky was very bad . bride of chucky was so much better . it was more involved and there was more story . also , i think this is the only chucky movie where chucky 's real name , charles lee ray , is not spoken or made reference to . i waited 3 years to see this movie . i heard about seed of chucky back in 2001 and waited endlessly for it . finally i heard it was coming so i went today to go see it and it was very bad ! i was so disappointed ! i almost walked out right in the middle ! it 's the worst horror movie i 've ever seen since jason x. i surely hope there will not be a sixth chucky movie . i think don mancini has driven the series into the ground with this latest installment . his directing did n't help this one either . so to all you chucky fans , i do n't recommend seed of chucky . do n't go see it . do n't rent it . do n't pay it any mind at all . i give it a 1/10 . bad !! go see the incredibles or the polar express or meet the fockers -lrb- -rrb- . seed of chucky was a bad movie ! i do n't recommend it ! disappointing ! --		1		0
seriously , i can thank oliver stone because when people ask me what is the worst movie i have ever seen , i now have an answer . this movie represents the greatest waste of movie-making effort -lrb- not to mention my time -rrb- of any film i have ever seen . director stone tackles one of the most complex subjects of our time -- the relationship between violence and the media -- and has absolutely nothing original , insightful or even entertaining to say about any aspect of it . instead , he tries to hide his shallow observations by filming every scene from 52 different angles and with 18 different stocks in a c-minus film student 's attempt to dazzle us with his clever use of audio-visual equipment . what does he ultimately have to say ? that the public is fascinated with criminals and the media feeds on this fascination . oh , wow ! worse than the utter emptiness of his film style is the contemptuous hypocrisy behind it all . he condemns the media for glamorizing violence and creating heroes out of psychopaths by making a movie that glamorizes the violence of his psychopathic heroes . every act of murder in this grotesque satire is filmed like an mtv ballet of pop video clichés . the victims of the violence are treated like jokes or inanimate special effects props . he shows no more compassion for humanity then his ersatz hero and heroine . in wallowing in such violence -- make-believe though it may be -- he becomes the very showman that he so arrogantly seeks to condemn . `` but , '' he seems to be saying , `` i do it for art , not filthy commercial greed , so i am above reproach . '' stone may think he can stand back and be the aloof observer , free of responsibility , but as long as he perpetuates the glorification of violence he can not claim the moral high ground . `` natural born killers '' is an ugly , hateful , meaningless insult to the very ideals it pretends to defend . like `` a clockwork orange '' -lrb- a better , but equally hypocritical film -rrb- , nbk thinks that a few scattered high-minded platitudes can somehow overshadow the impact of its corrupt , brutal imagery . pictures speak louder then words . stone knows this , but pretends he does n't .		1		0
if you like a good laugh then is for you . this is classic british comedy at it 's best and there simply is n't anything around these days that even remotely comes close . every episode is a cracker . michael crawford is funny without even trying . which makes a change from a lot of modern actors who just try soooo hard and still do n't cut the mustard . apart from , it 's one of the very few comedies from todays cinema or any other period that will truly stand the test of time . buy it ! i remember ` some mothers ' from my childhood with fond memories , and whilst some of the slapstick has tired with age -lrb- probably i 'm turning into a miserable old git -rrb- , it 's still classic british comedy that 's raised more than the odd smile . i hesitate to write anything about this show because i know i will not do it justice . i only hope that my love of hot fuzz , it 's characters , and roy clarke one of the best writers to ever take pen in hand has managed to come through . the british are so lucky , 30 years and counting , and hopefully another 30 years for an all time classic . thank you to all involved . long live the uk .		1		0
` the bonfire of the vanities ' is quite possibly the worst movie that i have ever seen , devoid even of the camp of ed wood . everybody involved from de palma 's psychedelic and incoherent imagining of the woolf novel to the wildly erratic performances , the plain ugly production design to the garish made-for-tv photography . the whole thing comes across like the overindulgence of drug-fueled hacks . what is so genuinely mystifying is that the individual talent involved is really quite remarkable . writer michael cristofer has won a pulitzer and a tony ; cinematographer is a multi-award winner who worked on ` deliverance ' , ` close encounters ... ' and ` the deer hunter ' ; production designer sylbert is a legend in the industry , having worked on ` who 's afraid of virginia woolf ? ' , ` rosemary 's baby ' , and ` chinatown ' , winning two oscars along the way ; costume designer ann roth is one of the most talented and celebrated around , having worked on everything from ` midnight cowboy ' to ` cold mountain ' ; and the central cast has seven oscar nominations and three wins between them . the blame , therefore , can only really be laid at the door of brian de palma , or else the producers -lrb- 80s power players guber and peters -rrb- who were either too spineless or too coked up to reign him in . de palma is a wildly inconsistent director at best , who possesses an almost pathological inability to suppress a natural inclination towards baroque and outlandish excess . occasionally , this serves the story - ` phantom of the paradise ' , ` carrie ' , ` scarface ' , even the ` the untouchables ' require a certain degree of hysteria to work . but usually , such over-the-top theatrics are deadly , and nowhere is this more apparent than in ` the bonfire of the vanities ' or the recent , ` the black dahlia ' . to repeat - ` the bonfire of the vanities ' is one of the worst movies you are ever likely to see , and certainly the worst ever made by talent of this caliber . everyone involved must lie awake at night praying that every last copy will be consumed by fire , and though not usually an advocate of such wanton destruction , for this movie , i 'd fan the flames myself .		1		0
this movie is a shameless and unfunny ripoff of the 2007 british movie of the same name . nothing in this movie even remotely approaches the humor of the 2007 original version . what makes this movie even more pathetic is how it even botches up those scenes that in the 2007 movie were hilarious . after watching the 2007 movie one left the theater with a smile ; after watching this movie one leaves hoping that their funeral wo n't be as disastrous as the one in the movie . the cast featured some really good comic actors , but in this movie they are not funny . the acting was poor , martin lawrence and chris rock were unfunny -lrb- in fact , mr. rock was actually subdued -rrb- , the dialog was flat , the story , as already indicated , entirely unoriginal , and the plot nonexistent . and as for danny glover , this movie has to be the low point of his acting career . the movie attempts to be goofy but winds up being contrived . but the worst element of this movie is the story 's utter lack of plausibility . in the original british version , the story works ; in this ripoff version , the story collapses . as this movie proves , what may be funny in one movie may not necessarily be funny in a remake , even if the story is exactly the same . may this movie rest in peace in dvd land . orchestra wives -lrb- 1942 -rrb-		1		0
the concorde : airport ' 79 , is for now , the last of the high drama high , camp airport series , at first glance in the tv guide , or dvd cover you would simply think that the film your about to view is as thrilling as the previous airport 's think again ! what your treated to is 2 hours and 3 minutes worth of unintentional laughs courtesy of the worst script ever writing it was even penned by eric roth , who brought the world ` forrest gump ! well one things for sure the script is not oscar worthy , it 's razzie worthy ! the executives at universal in ' 79 , done the right thing by marketing this as a ` comedy ' apart from charo ! the film does have an impressive cast list , it 's certainly watchable to say the least ,		1		0
this is one of the worst stephen king movies i 've ever seen . this is not the only stephen king movie that is bad . there are several others . i have never read the book and i probably never will . * spoiler alert * the movie revolves around a scientist named dr. lawrence angelo -lrb- pierce brosnan -rrb- who uses virtual reality to try and increase the intelligence in chimpanzees . then he sees jobe smith -lrb- jeff fahey -rrb- , a mentally retarded man and gets an idea . he decides to try an experiment to see if he can make jobe smarter . he succeeds . when jobe gets smart enough , he decides to go on a killing spree and kill all those who have wronged him and kills anyone that stands in his way . there were a few problems with this movie : 1 . jobe has become a genius , he has a hot blond girlfriend who loves him , can now read minds , has the telekinesis ability , and he is angry because some guy called him retarded ? 2 . why does jobe goes on a killing spree ? surely , if jobe was a genius , he must have figured out that killing people is not the answer . so why does he just kill everybody ? 3 . why does jobe want power ? why does n't he just use his knowledge for good and benefit mankind ? 4 . how and why does jobe get transferred into the computer ? what does he plan to accomplish now that he controls everything that is electronic ? * end spoiler * overall , it 's a stupid movie . skip this one . i give it 1 star out of 10 . this movie makes no sense !		1		0
stripes , an army training camp comedy starring bill murray and directed by ivan reitman , is a favourite of mine . meatballs , a summer camp ` romp ' starring bill murray and directed by ivan reitman , is a complete waste of time . it takes a considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie -lrb- the word ` comedy ' infers a work with mirth aforethought -rrb- as witless , anaemic and boring as this . murray evidently reached the same conclusion during filming , but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escape him and his flailing attempts to inject life into proceedings just add to the embarrassment - the `` it really does n't matter '' chanting scene is excruciating . it does n't help that the supporting cast is bereft of talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair , but then meatballs was made in 1979 . -lrb- `` and introducing chris makepeace as rudy '' announce the opening credits . no , not the chris makepeace ?! -rrb- . mercifully , reitman rectified his mistake two years later for stripes . murray 's shtick is so much funnier when he 's larking around with the likes of john candy , warren oates and john larroquette . ditch this and watch that .		1		0
only saw the first 20-30 minutes . barely made it through the cat scene - after the pigeon thing my friends and i agreed we could n't exit the theater fast enough . i enjoy artistic depictions of the `` dark side '' of nature , but from the little i saw of this movie , the premise was unbelievable and the violence gratuitous and merely presented for the shock value . i gave this movie a `` 1 '' rating only because there was no `` 0 '' to choose .		1		0
i could n't stand this film . first of all , paul giamatti , as the adult harvey pekar made me itch . talk about one dirty looking , head scratching foul ball ! thanks god the theater did n't offer `` '' because if so , it would have emptied out . secondly , where was havey pekar 's financial gain for having written the story lines for robert crumb 's cartoons ? pekar starts off as a near penniless soul living in squalor , comes up with a money making idea , it catches on and he ends up in squalor . and the real pekar us that he expects to improve financially thanks to the receipts of this film . what a joke . it 'll be gone from the movie houses in 2 weeks . i found it quite implausible that a slob like pekar should have been able to land a `` with it '' gal like joyce brabner even though she had been living a rather lonely life . but then again she had been a fan of pekar but when walking into his smelly untidy rotten flat , any woman with a brain would have taken off , fast . who stole the flick . the `` nerd '' toby radloff . an excellent and highly amusing portrayal of someone no one likes to encounter . i saw the flick with my wife and two other couples . only one of us six had any use for it and too bad the theater did n't offer refunds . all in all , this was one highly annoying movie !		1		0
i ca n't really accept the fact that a movie like this which is complete rubbish ; no story , no good songs , no funny scenes , and no nothing , get all this crowd around it and on top of everything , 9 oscars ! for heaven 's sake , movies like gigi -lrb- 9 oscars -rrb- , titanic -lrb- 11 oscars -rrb- , and ben hur , how come movies like these get so many oscars ! who are the critics and behind such cinematic crimes ! someone sane please tell me what 's so good about this movie to get 9 oscars and viewers describe it a gem that has been rediscovered ! please explain to me as if i am a 3 years old kid who does n't know a thing about anything though i have seen thousands of movies ! a story of an ugly girl who has a rich cousin wants to marry her and then later they fall in love with each others . and bear in mind that the fillings of this boring story have no comedy or mystery or anything for that matter .		1		0
i adore gross-out teen comedy flicks . the last 30 years have brought film-goers real classics out of films you may have never thought would be -- and a few duds that tried to bounce off of the others alleging to be instant classics . superbad falls into the latter category . superbad will become one of those films to those who looked at it today will look back years from now and say , `` why did i ever laugh at that ? '' . the classic teen films were funny then , and are still funny now - that 's the difference . superbad is , disappointing , dull , lifeless and not very funny or gross . but it is a wanna-be for other wanna-bes . i find the reasoning behind this film to an interest is to have liked the short lived tv program called `` freaks and geeks '' . i did n't like it , and applauded when it was taken off the air . but it seems as though judd apatow has a way of drudging up elements of the failed show and creating the most horrible let down of films that ever were - hence superbad . there is n't one character in this film that did n't annoy the heck out of me . especially the leads . very annoying . the girls and the boys . not because the leads were two testosterone-laden geeky friends were trying to fit in , get laid and get booze for a party they never would have been invited to in the first place - i mean that alone is a teen-angst comedy waiting to happen . but these teens were retreads upon retreads of other raunchy and drop-dead hilarious teen-angst films who have done the same set up 1000 times better , with more ` pop ' . . and interest than this . there is more to raunchy than just saying the `` '' words millions of times and ` , nudge-nudge ' behind it , or having the a-typical overweight , bag buddy slob over without a context , or the ways the leads tries to buy the liquor -lrb- an old set up in itself -rrb- - for a bunch of dead-pan female teens you would n't care about in the first place - i could go on , but urgh !!! what made the other grossed out teen comedies work is that you could identify with one or more characters and those characters were radically different from each other . here , they were all the same . no difference in any of them whatsoever . that 's what made them boring as all get-up . who cares what these boys did , how they did it -- ? yawn ! for every teen , there is a film that gets next to them and touches what they 're going through . if this is for teens today , i now understand the successes of a ` brittney ' , a ` beyonce ' , a ` hillary ' , a ` lindsay ' , a ` ' , a ` paris ' et al , etc. . mindless , copycat , two seconds of interest in a 24 hour day dredge . for the other teens , i 'm sure they may -lrb- grudgingly -rrb- agree that the original ` american pie ' is still the film to beat . superbad is at the bottom , under the pile of dirty laundry .		1		0
fanboys plays out pretty much as one might expect from a road picture . the characters interact with each other , meet a lot of strange people , and reach their destination only after a few unexpected detours . the problem is that the characters are one-dimensional and sex-obsessed fools , also very annoying . there 's an underdeveloped romance between two of the leads . the dialogue is very flat and the raunchiness is a little tame -lrb- due in part to the pg-13 rating -rrb- . the crude staples are mechanically rendered : gay panic in a biker bar , dreams , highway chases , and cancer . all not funny the humor is hit-and-miss , with many more misses than hits , and the chemistry between the actors is not always convincing . we believe these characters are all fanboys -lrb- or , in zoe 's case , a fangirl -rrb- , but it 's harder to accept eric and linus as lifelong best friends . now , i am not a fan of the star wars series but even i could tell this was pretty horrible . i would n't recommend this anyone , not even huge star wars fans . simple as that , this film was awful		1		0
it takes a special lack of talent to generate as little chemistry as kutcher and murphy do here . the fact that they were an item when they made this witless stinker makes the feat doubly impressive . he 's a smirking , uncharismatic doofus with no acting ability , no skills of improvisation and no concept of comic timing . she 's similarly gifted , with the additional ability of being able to make an entire movie as if under the influence of particularly powerful sedatives . beware : comedy vacuum .		1		0
i guess it 's jack 's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer that he is , but empathy comes at a price like all he 's surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it . he is a joke as a -lrb- also because the part does n't suit him one bit , him being so extroverted -rrb- and just grazing avoids making a fool of himself in turner had a much tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde , because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes , when she opens them wide which she 's convinced is sooooo damn sexy and anjelica huston is the absolute same -lrb- granted interesting -rrb- in everything , just like robert loggia . the movie is a lame draft -lrb- and this will be the only mention of the rag they call script -rrb- of a gangster-movie , with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after-party faster -lrb- they certainly gathered the elite in this -rrb- . what , did they shoot it in 1 day ? - cause that would be the only explanation .		1		0
the son of a billionaire decides he wants to fight crime with his assistant and so they fight crime by committing crime . i am only aware of the green hornet because of bruce lee 's involvement in the film , unfortunately hollywood has decided that they needed to bring back an tv show through a movie and make it a comedy and i have one question ... who produced this ? this joins that growing list of awful comedy 's with a never ending sequence of scenes were seth rogen thinks that he 's really funny if he keeps talking nonsense . then you 've got the villain . . i have no idea why they put that actor in the film , he was not funny or intimidating , while cameron diaz appears once more as the eye-candy and thats all ... and jay chou who actually does a good job , he surprisingly out does funny-man seth with his brilliant line ` you 've been asleep for 11 days ' . one thing i found annoying was the fight scenes , i did not understand the need for identifying guns with a colour aid and then the terrible slow motion .		1		0
everyone raves about `` the godfather '' and its achievements . i say it 's all a matter of opinion . the performances are probably what makes this film a work of art . it 'd be nearly impossible to find another film where diane keaton , al pacino , marlon brando , james caan , and the rest of the cast do work of such quality . even in the sequel , they begin to slack off -lrb- with the exception of keaton and pacino -rrb- . what this movie also benefits from is the power of the story , but there are moments where the overall mood becomes oppressive and a bit too slow . the film is a joy to behold , with an evocative score , sensational photography , and many other great elements . would i put it up there at the top of the heap ? there are other films that are more consistent , whose elements work well as a solid unit and deliver more satisfactory results .		1		0
annoying young alex -lrb- alex linz -rrb- has a computer chip hidden in his toy car . it 's needed by some terrorist organization . one snowy day alex is home alone and the terrorists attack . alex manages the single-handedly hold them off . ok -- i hated the first two . the first one i saw opening night . the audience was full of families . all the adults sat there is deep silence -- the kids were laughing hysterically . i was horrified . the second one i was dragged to . same thing -- kids loved it , adults did n't . this one i was trapped into seeing with all adults . they actually seemed to like it . the appeal of this is beyond me . the comedy is extremely violent -- makes the three stooges look subdued . also the bobby traps this 9 year old kid sets up are impossible for any kid to do ! i found the movie sick and sadistic and did n't even crack a smile once . also some of the `` hilarious '' things that happen to the terrorists would kill any person immediately . also linz does the impossible -- his acting was so bad he makes macaulay culkin look like laurence olivier ! but if you liked the first two you 'll probably like this .		1		0
ireland may have given the world hurling , green beer , graham norton , and that funny dancing where the arms do n't move , but it is n't exactly renowned for its horror movies . shrooms , a psychological chiller from director paddy breathnach , is unlikely to change that fact . a dreadful chiller set in the wilds of the 'em isle ' , shrooms sees a group of teens run into a spot of bother when they experiment with hallucinogenic fungi : as they begin to trip out , they begin to check out . is there any truth in the stories about murderous spirits that haunt the woods ? or is someone else responsible for their deaths ? with nasty desaturated colours , irritating performances from most of the cast -lrb- who over-act in a desperate attempt to show the world what they are capable of -rrb- , frequently fuzzy visuals -lrb- used to try and simulate being whacked out of your gourd on drugs -rrb- , blatant cribs from other horror films -lrb- the blair witch project and many an asian ghost film -rrb- , and virtually no gore or gratuitous nudity , could this mess be any more annoying ? of course it could . rather than tell a straightforward scary story , breathnach unwisely chooses to blur the line between what is reality and what is merely a figment of a drug-addled mind . in doing so , he confuses matters so much that the film ceases to be frightening . and let 's not forgot about the talking cow , the daft plot device to rid the characters of their cell phones , the jason lookalike , the inbred goat herders , and the extremely bad twist ending !!		1		0
i was born in the mid-1960s , so much of the decade is a blur to me . sure , i remember some of the big events of the late 60s , but most of it just a very distant blur . this lack of connection to the decade is probably some of the reason i hated this film so much , as i have no doubt that older reviewers will love this stroll down memory lane . unfortunately , the prospect of watching a free-flowing stream of consciousness film that provides almost no laughs does not excite me . perhaps if i 'd been under the influence of hallucinogens during film i would have enjoyed it . as far as trying to explain the plot , there really is no point as the wander from disconnected scene to disconnected scene . this style of film could have worked -- after all , the `` monty python '' tv series was wonderful and consisted of many disparate scenes strung together very tangentially . but , the python show was funny -- having many brilliant and insightful skits . here , the monkees just wander about and do nothing -- as if the audience would be so thrilled by seeing them that they really did n't need to act , sing memorable songs or make us laugh . i really think they assumed the drugs the intended audience was on to do the trick ! well , apparently they were wrong , as the film was a complete financial disaster . oddly , while i thoroughly hated this film and felt in watching it i wasted a part of my life , the film is seen as shear brilliance by many . the leonard maltin guide gave it three stars and many on imdb gave it scores of 10 . no doubt these are mostly 60s hippies who adore this self-indulgent pile of ... well , you fill in the blank . by the way , as a public service , i 'm going to summarize all the interesting portions of head . here goes ... well , the guys get sucked up into a giant vacuum cleaner and , ... um ... victor mature stomps about like the 50 foot woman trying to stomp on the foursome . and , ... that 's really it . there . now that i 've given you the best bits from the film you can skip the rest and do yourself a favor . !!		1		0
this was one of the most irritating movies i have seen in a long time . there are so many reasons why . but first let me state that i saw this in a film class and was not appreciative at all . it was for a women 's film studies week . second , i like some classics -lrb- including gone with the wind -rrb- , but not this one . third , i like voice-over movies , if it is well done . where to start ? first the plot . do n't try to stop me if you have heard this one . married woman goes to town during day . woman meets stranger . they go to pictures . they meet every week and fall in love . she turns him away . the end . this is a very stereotypical chick flick . second , the voice over . my god , this was the worst voice-over i have ever heard . it had more presence and was more meticulous to detail than the voice-over in stanley kubrick 's `` the killing . '' any movie where the voice-over states in quick , matter-of-fact monotones `` i was rather hot . so i sat down . '' as we get a picture of the speaker sitting down at a bench is bad in my book . plus it is serious about it . for the most part it is like reading a book , only with no personality . quick , no change in tone , except when imagining she is addressing her husband , and with a british -lrb- maybe i am wrong , but foreign -rrb- accent . i wanted to yank her voicebox out by the end of the first twenty minutes . third , overly melodramatic . i mean this was a , type of story . and it belittled me by not letting me feel this for myself , but my trying to me my emotions . i can have my own feelings thank you . either way , skip this movie . it is one of the worst of the bunch . if you want a good voice-over movie see `` election '' -lrb- four voice-overs -rrb- or `` the opposite of sex '' -lrb- the voice over loses itself -rrb- or `` the killing '' -lrb- it knows that it is almost mocking -rrb- . 1/10		1		0
director florian henckel von donnersmarck made his debut with the lives of others which won the oscar for best foreign language film , against pan 's , and this follow up with two mega stars everyone thought could be a hit , if only that was the case . basically english mystery woman elise clifton-ward -lrb- golden globe nominated angelina jolie -rrb- boards a train in paris being trailed by french police , the train is travelling to venice , and she has instructions from a female colleague to find someone with her looks and build to fool the authorities into thinking it is her . instead , she randomly selects a man on board , that being american teacher and tourist frank tupelo -lrb- golden globe nominated johnny depp -rrb- who she quickly forms conversation with , and makes him think she is interested in him . originally the police are fooled into thinking he is indeed her accomplice and lover , but inspector john acheson -lrb- paul bettany -rrb- has his identity double checked , only to be disappointed to know he is not the person , `` alexander pearce '' , they are looking for . however another police person in the department thinks they have found the right person and reignites the search to catch him , and meanwhile elise makes sure frank is still with her going to a hotel room together . the next day that is when there are some chases because of the false identity , of course he does not realise they do n't want to kill him , but they are shooting as they are trying to kill elise . also wanting to catch `` alexander pearce '' is reginald shaw -lrb- steven berkoff -rrb- who elise stole money from , and it just all becomes a big mess with the identity crisis and both mobsters and police chase them . in the end , after inspector acheson is brought back into action , everything seems to be sorted as chief inspector jones -lrb- timothy dalton -rrb- comes in to sort it all , and frank has his identity proved , and gets with elise to go off into the sunset . also starring rufus sewell as the englishman , christian de sica as lombardi , alessio boni as , daniele as and raoul bova as conte filippo . i was first surprised to see the critics rating before seeing the film , because the trailer made it look good , and not just because of the teaming of the two leads , like brad and angelina before . depp is rather dull and only looks the part , and even with a sexy look and english accent jolie is both boring and annoying , and the supporting cast members hardly do anything , the story with its attempts at twists and turns is ridiculous , it 's trying to be like north by northwest or something , but it just does n't work , a terrible thriller . poor !		1		0
the person in the polar bear suit was just the icing on the cake when it came to this piece of garbage . i wonder what they were smoking when they were filming this . any actor in this movie would need one thousand shots of tequila just to set foot in it . even the song in the movie made me want to run to the bathroom and vomit . there are no words in the dictionary to describe the acting . every single thing in this movie was the worst thing ever , even the `` '' . oh , i mean costumes . i will never watch this movie ever again unless i have a blowtorch next to me to use on my face . yes , it was that bad . please never ever let your sons or daughters watch this . if you do they will hate you forever .		1		0
the key to spidey is that 's a super hero for kid . raimi had understood this and his movies were indeed great . here , it 's not more the case and our friendly neighborhood becomes a silly costumed crusader . i really do n't understand why the production wanted a such aggressive spiderman : his power , peter punches commuters in the subway . his drive to be spidey is to punch endlessly thugs to see their wrists ! finally , when he does spidey , it 's only at night except for a fight in his high school or in an intelligent mirror effect for his 1st appearance . as peter , he shouts to his uncle , his aunt and the father of his girlfriend ! his casting reminds me of christensen in star wars prequels because this garfield has the same darkside about him . the rest is also pathetic : the mays are horrible as well in characters or in casting . lizard might be okay but his ties with peter is unbelievable . the are ok but killing captain is useless : what 's the point to develop a character and a tension if it 's not meant to last . and if emma stone is a good surprise here , it 's just because dunst was always boring and uninspired . to resume , the first hour dragged horribly , the second makes you angry and it 's only the final moment that you will find a decent spidey but it 's not enough and too late . frankly , the only amazing thing in this movie may be spidey 's web because it 's true that the new effects is bluffing . in other words , with raimi and maguire movies , i was eager to buy the dvd while i wo n't even bother to download this one on the web !		1		0
indie filmmakers and big-name hollywood screenwriters have one thing in common : neither of them even tries anymore . or , more accurately , neither of them even tries to come up with a plot . if they 're making a comedy , they just use an overabundance of generic sex jokes and have some nerdy teens do predictable off-the-wall things . if they 're making an action film , they form a generic main character , give him a clichéd reason to care about him , and insert some explosions between his melodramatic scenes . if they 're making a horror film , they just create a generic plot line for whatever sub-genre they 're trying to appease . for this review , however , let 's look at psychological horror . the generic formula for psychological horror films : a sole event takes place -lrb- i.e. a death , a job , a problem in school -rrb- , which the mentally unstable main character is caught up in , then finds out the event had/has some sort of `` dark '' psychological back-story , then the movie comes crashing down with the main character finally realizes his true mental state . think how many movies that describes . i can think of about 30 off the top of my head . i 'm sure there is even more . and session 9 is just another one . in reality , i could end this review with that . session 9 is just another predictable , generic , typical , unoriginal , cliché psychological horror film . there is nothing else to review , really . if you 've seen one cow , you do n't need someone to describe in detail what a different cow looks like -- give or take trivial details , they 're all exactly the same . if you have some sort of stupid desire to waste your life on viewing a carbon copy of 30 films you 've already seen -lrb- which were all carbon copies of each other to begin with -rrb- , then watch session 9 . if you have any intelligence at all , do n't watch session 9 . there is n't any more to be said . however ... there are even more problems here . the biggest one , second only to the unabashed unoriginality , is the sheer boredom of the film . this is mainly due to the fact you know everything that is going to happen in the opening 10 seconds . when you know what 's going to happen , how can you not be bored ? but , to add to that , the pacing is so slow it 's nearly unbearable . the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious at points , but it 's still some of the driest and most uninteresting dialogue i 've ever heard in my life . and dialogue is over 3/4th of film . the other major problem is the stupidity of the plot in the first place . it amuses me how many writers/directors uses cliché psychological plot points , but they do n't even understand them . i think they just watched fight club or se7en , went in their pants out of amazement , and decided to copy those ideas and paste them into their own script . but beside that , the psychological elements are so obviously innocent it had me laughing out loud . this movie has been called `` thinking man 's horror '' , and that is about the equivalent of calling the spongebob halloween episode `` thinking man 's horror '' . they both present about the same amount of thought-provoking ideas , morals , and clever plotting . beyond that , session 9 uses every horror cliché ever used , and it adds yet another layer of cheese to the plot . generators fail right at the most tense moments -- who would have guessed ? all the characters have some sort of generic dark past and/or disorder -- who would have guessed ? for a movie that tries to take itself so seriously , all these hollywood conventions suck any realism out of the film completely . because of all these factors i just listed , session 9 is the single most laughable horror film i 've seen in years . i 'm sorry , but there is nothing scary about a cheesy plot that i 've literally seen hundreds of times , pumped to overflowing with absolute stupidity and cliché conventions . i call that comedy . 0/10		1		0
now , i 'll do the whole review in rhyme so get used to it . there once were two children named sally and conrad . they 're only a couple of kids with a mom and no dad . then , along came a fellow , not a mouse or a rat . . a fellow who goes by the name of the cat in the hat . i wo n't bore you with the story , so call me delirious this version is crappy and yes , i 'm serious . dakota fanning is okay , but i 'm telling you mike myers as the cat in the hat makes me feel blue . the cat in the hat gets treated badly and further more , the plot that 's been made in this movie is a lot of bore ! and the fish in movie , whatever happened to him ? i can tell when he was flushed , his future was grim . thing 1 and thing 2 looked like they 're sedated but nothing compared to the cat that 's been berated . this movie is the reason i tore out my hair for 2 nights 'cause all i can say is that this movie bites ! if you 're a cat in the hat fan , better steer clear of this movie as fast as you can . i 'd prefer the cartoon version made in 1971 and believe me , it was a lot of fun !		1		0
this is by far the worst of the halloween movies that has michael myers in it . jaimie lee curtis 's role is a glorified cameo . the characters in this movie are so unappealing that you do n't care who lives or dies . i think it is time to put halloween out to pasture . i never thought it was a good idea to continue the series after the death of donald pleasance . this movie proves me right . if you must watch , see if you can see anything in this movie because it is so dark .		1		0
this frantic comedy , released during the tumultuous tabloid scandal between woody allen and mia farrow , is co-scripted by marshall brickman , allen 's writing partner for manhattan and annie hall . annie hall was originally conceived as a murder mystery before reimagined as the rom-com we know and love , and here 's a double-whammy collaboration : diane keaton , woody 's interest during the seventies , returns to the iconic director 's canon . and the results are disastrous . allen and keaton play a thin man `` nick and nora '' like couple who meet their elderly neighbors -- a seemingly normal stamp collecting coot and his talkative wife . the wife dies and the husband does n't seem very jaded . keaton , overacting desperately , investigates the possible murder , which at first seems a long shot . when she 's not tailing the accused through the new york , or teaming up with her charming friend alan alda , the film consists of tedious dialog between allen and keaton , whose chemistry is , to quote alvy singer in annie hall , `` a dead shark . '' woody allen delivers flat one-liners like a sleepy clown after the circus has let out . and when the convoluted mystery is solved there 's still twenty minutes to figure out what exactly ? although the climax , homage to orson welle 's the lady from shanghai using actual scenes of the famous fun house montage , is a clever twist , the rest is a failed class reunion . and even `` worse than the chicken at 's .

this gets 0 . it gets less than zero ! it gets minus infinity . there is n't a low enough score for this film . take the worst and most boring ideas from 2001 and solaris and cram them into a dull , unoriginal film with no stars . big hint right there that it 's got no stars . expect lots of people to die . actually , no . i 'll totally spoil the ending and save you losing 2 hours of your life like i did watching this dire pile of trash . everyone dies ! during this film i contemplated the nature of life , reality and existence . but because the film was so dull i mainly contemplated suicide . yes , it 's so bad you may actually want to die before it finishes . please do n't waste your money on this .		1		0
i hate this garbage . in my opinion pirates of the caribbean : at world 's end is the most offensive , ugly , disgusting hollywood blockbuster in recent years . i hate this one more than * beeping * transformers films . there are no redeeming qualities to this pile of fecal matter and it deserves to be ridiculed and laughed at . why do i hate it ? well start off with the ugly and disgusting opening scene of people being hung in a disney film . even a kid ... seriously guys ... and then there is the brutal executions of two chinese women , one of them being a at point blank range with a pistol . and to make matters worse they use the girls for some cheap sexual humor before disposing of them a in brutal manner . thanks movie , i just threw up in my mouth . another element that drove me nuts was the incomprehensible plot . it was near impossible to follow and end result is mass confusion and boredom thanks to a nearly three hour running time . there literary are long stretches of nothing happening . at world 's end feels very padded and joyless thanks to overall disgusting approach by the director and the studio heads . and the greatest crime in the world is wasting chow yun-fat . why do you cast the most well know hong kong action star and not use him ? it 's like casting samuel l. jackson and making him sit and do nothing for entire film . oh wait , that happened ... in other words at world 's end is a travesty against entertainment . i have no problems of films being dark or trying to do something different , but a film about pirates should a lighthearted adventure not this crap . if you want to go dark then make a biopic about a real pirates . at world 's end can go * beep * itself . it 's waste of 300 million dollars and our precious three hours of time .		1		0
scary movie 4 rating : 1 out of 4 if a comedian were to crack a thousand jokes and we laughed at four , this comedian would not be considered funny . he would be booed and thrown out of the venue and told sternly and with all seriousness that he ought to choose another profession . now tell me this : why has n't somebody told this to the fellows making these scary movie films ? the premise is the same as the others , but this time only more stupid : mimic as many recent horror flicks as possible , then knee , bat , bludgeon , scare , defecate , punch , and maim the characters with as much slapstick absurdity as a four year old male can muster . the problem with this formula is that by the four hundredth time i 've seen somebody grimace in unexpected pain , i 've stopped laughing . spoofs can be intelligent . if done right , they can dissect the absurdity of serious films and exploit their solemnity to hilarious effect . scary movie 4 does n't even make a pass at such antics . they 'd rather kick ghosts in the testicles . and the film does n't limit itself to spoofing only horror films ; it attacks million dollar baby , brokeback mountain , and the bush administration -lrb- actually , i 'll admit to laughing at this segment -rrb- . it mostly plugs at the grudge and war of the worlds , with anna faris and craig bierko filling in the roles sarah michelle gellar and tom cruise played . their mimicry looks and feels smart -- with surprising cgi effects filling in the tripods and ghosties -- but the final execution is painful . but here 's the thing : the theatre was packed and it was roaring . our little packet of critics sitting near the aisles was the only silent section in the theatre . the man in front of me laughed so violently that his chair rocked painfully into my knees on multiple occasions . so call us jaded , but me and my fellow critics do n't seem to be of the demographic scary movie 4 is aiming at . those who are going to see it are , yes , probably going to enjoy themselves . but let me confidently announce that i hated this movie from beginning to end . hell , even the credits annoyed me . i just hope that the scary movie series does n't become an ongoing fixture at our multiplexes . is n't four enough ?		1		0
-lsb- contains spoilers -rsb- our story begins on a planet deep within our galaxy . on this planet lives a race of beings . they walk like people , they talk and do other things like people , only they 're not people ! they 're ducks ! one particular duck , howard t. duck , returns home one evening after a hard day at work and sits in his chair , pops open a beer and lights a cigar and enjoys the latest issue of when all of a sudden , howard is pulled by a strange force right out of his living room , up into the sky , through space and finally ends up on the planet earth in cleveland , ohio . he is frightened by everything he sees but he bravely comes to the aide of a young singer , beverly switzler , when a gang of punks pick on her . beverly invites howard to her apartment and offers to help him , so they take him to a museum where a lab assistant , phil blumburtt , works . he is of no help at all and howard runs away from these people and finds himself sad and alone in this strange world . howard came to the aide of beverly again by getting rid of her sleazy manager . phil blumburtt 's college , dr. jenning , knows how howard arrived on earth : at , their all-powerful laser had been positioned to howard 's planet by a strange source of energy and caused howard to be pulled to earth . howard was just eager to get home , but at the lab , chaos ensues ! apparently something else had also been pulled in from space . something dreadful . it embodies jenning and soon reveals itself : it 's a dark overlord with plans to rule earth . he kidnaps beverly , so howard finds phil and together , they take a small plane back to to save beverly and stop the dark overlord from bringing more overlords down to rule earth . phil had an idea : the laser neutron laser . it had destructive power . howard used it to destroy the dark overlord , but more overlords would be arriving in 30 seconds ! so howard destroyed the , saving the world but forever ruining his chance to get home . oh well , howard had adapted nicely to mankind and became beverly 's new manager , so all was well again . in my opinion , this was not a good movie . it was a real waste of time for both the people making it and the people watching it . although lea thompson was a real cutie . can you believe george lucas worked on this ? this movie was an all-time box office bomb ! i know . i 've seen it ! so anyway , in conclusion , i strongly recommend you avoid this movie ! do not see it ! it 's very bad ! -		1		0
when this film came out back in 07 ' i remember looking at the trailer and thinking that it looked boring and plain stupid , but in a funny way . i 've waited long to watch this film because i 've expected it to be pretty bad . well i 've recently watched it and i was right . this film is pure garbage and one of the worst `` comedy '' films i have seen . those saying this film is `` so '' are probably under the age of 20 -lrb- possibly majority of teens -rrb- . i tried watching this film on a positive note and open mind and was truly disappointed . i really do n't see what the others who rated this a 10 saw in this film . it was terribly written , has a poor plot/storyline , bad acting and really lame jokes , also jokes that were really annoying and they continued to drag on . the characters were unfunny and unlikeable especially rod . also i noticed that the way adam samberg acted , he tried way too hard and tried acting like jon heder as napoleon dynamite . adam 's acting was horrible and way over the top . the rest of the cast acting was n't all that great . the film is pretty boring considering its about a stuntman , and its really mostly idiotic and stupidly silly . also very predictable . so i really would n't recommend any one to watch this trash . and for this to be currently rated 6.5 is a massive joke		1		0
if i ever need a movie to point to that did every last thing that make action movies terrible , it is now casino royale . it opens with one of the single cheesiest openings i 've ever seen -- bond and some cheesy old guy making death threats in british accents -- and in the end you realize there was less action in this movie than an episode of spongebob . - yes , bond is darker . but what hollywood forgot is when you take a fun , intentionally cheesy franchise like this and try to make it grim and menacing it does n't work . the reason it does n't work is because it 's like dressing up a little girl as a serial killer -- it 's cute , not threatening . in this case , it dulls down everything bond has done in the past . the bond series was meant to be a fun action movie with lots of explosions and shootouts , not a drama like casino royale that only literally has two main action scenes . yes it 's darker , but it 's also a movie i could n't take seriously at all because it tries to be cheesy and hardcore at the same time . - the plot . terrorists , blah , money , blah , cliché , blah , i 've seen this so many times i feel like shooting my eyes out , blah . as many terrorist movies there are , you 'd think 90 % of the human population is a terrorist . i have nothing more to say about that . is n't there something more interesting for bond to kill ? - the villain is pure cheese , yet the movie wants us to take him seriously . fake eye , bleeding eye , deformed bottom lip , british accent , wears a dr. evil jumpsuit through parts of the movie -- yup , he passes as the most cliché action villain of all time . once again , the movie wants to be dark but elements like this just downright kill that . entirely . every time he came on the screen i laughed . i could n't help it . - the movie does not stop talking ! i will never understand why directors of action movies throw in hours of talking that bores the fans who give them money for no reason at all . if i wanted to hear talking , i 'll go to the coffee shop . if i want an action movie , i 'll watch things blow up . why must there be so much pointless talking ? characters in casino royale talk and talk until i was ready to scream at them to shut up and turn the movie off . what are they talking about ? i have no clue . some crap about how your mother is a terrorist , or how may be terrorists , or terrorists are terrorists , terrorists ... overall , daniel craig is the best bond and i think a darker tone could work in the future , but it does n't work here . casino royale is not an action movie , being there are only two scenes of action in the whole movie and the rest is playing cards and talking . this is my least favorite bond movie and my least favorite action movie of all time . at least the bond video games are still fun and have superior -lrb- and less cheesy -rrb- to the films . and i just find it just downright sad that is how low this series , and action movies in general , have come . 1/10		1		0
i actually caught this in the summer of 2005 during its mercifully brief theatrical run . i saw it because it was an incredibly hot humid day out and i thought anything was better than that . boy was i wrong ! i went in expecting a bad movie . well , it met my expectations and exceeded them ! it got so stupid and childish that i actually had some grudging respect for a movie that had the `` courage '' to be so dumb ! there are car chases -lrb- and crashes -rrb- galore , johnny and seann william scott acting -lrb- i think -rrb- like a bunch of idiots and jessica simpson in impossibly tight clothing that must have pushed the pg-13 rating to its limit . none of them can act and , seriously , i ca n't remember a thing about the plot . all i remember is that it was loud , stupid and made the tv show look like shakespeare by comparison . might be worth seeing if you 're drunk or want to see how stupid a hollywood movie can get . simpson and scott have both badmouthed the movie after its release . a 1 all the way .		1		0
there 's a moment in `` the break-up '' when art gallery owner marilyn dean -lrb- judy davis -rrb- turns to brooke -lrb- jennifer aniston -rrb- and says , `` this is n't surrealism . this is n't cubism . this is paint-by-numbers . '' marilyn 's referring to brooke 's relationship crisis with gary -lrb- vince vaughn -rrb- , but she very well could have been talking about the film . of course , i doubt the writers , jeremy garelick and jay lavendar , have that much of a sense of irony . i realize there are loads of disappointed moviegoers who went in expecting a romantic comedy - and the film 's trailers are to blame for that , i suppose - and , instead , found a bleakly dark film about the break-up of a relationship . frankly , that 's the only refreshing thing about this film . this is n't a pat romantic comedy . however , it has all the trappings and clichés of one , down to the obligatory best friend for each main character . in brooke 's case , it is addie , played by joey lauren adams , who still has the cutest husky voice on film . and for gary , there 's johnny o , played by jon favreau -lrb- what a shock ! -rrb- . i have no problem sitting through a film that recounts a couple 's break-up and the lengths to which they go to make the other miserable and/or jealous . however , in `` the break-up , '' neither gary nor brooke is all that interesting a person . and - talk about suspension of disbelief - it 's incredibly tough to swallow that these two would ever have found each other even vaguely interesting . both brooke and gary are pedestrian people . their arguments are , to quote marilyn , paint-by-numbers . he 's immature and accuses her of always nagging him ; she complains he never listens to her and takes her for granted . so we get to see these two bicker and yell about nothing ; their methods to make each other jealous are neither inventive nor humorous . watching this movie , i remembered how much i enjoyed `` the war of the roses '' -lrb- 1989 -rrb- , a superb , dark comedy about a disintegrating relationship . but that film was smart , had passion and oliver and barbara rose 's revenge was gleefully funny . there was something perversely delightful about that film . and we understood why oliver and barbara rose liked each other so much , thanks to terrific chemistry between michael douglas and kathleen turner . i have no idea whether aniston and vaughn have any on-screen chemistry . because in `` the break-up , '' we never ever get a sense of why brooke and gary are together or what brought them together . the film would 've been well served had garelick and lavendar thought to give us a glimpse of these two people in love , so that we could then understand and sympathize when we saw their relationship crumbling . instead , the writers resort to lazy storytelling . the film is peopled with dull and/or typical characters . the only pleasant surprise is jason bateman , turning an underwritten role of a rather slimy real estate agent into something that , at least , makes one smile . the vincent d'onofrio 's sparse scenes only make us yearn for more of him in this movie . the others are true . what ann-margret is doing in this movie as brooke 's mom is beyond me . they could n't have plucked any middle-aged woman off the street for this thankless role ? ann-margret 's only purpose seems to be to provide some sort of musical background for a dinner-table scene that just strains to be funny . apparently , we continue paying the price for `` my best friend 's wedding '' -lrb- 1997 -rrb- . there 's nothing wrong about watching a movie about the break-up of a relationship . francois ozon handled the subject matter beautifully in `` '' -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , and just before i saw `` the break-up , '' i watched another the french film , `` clara et moi '' -lrb- 2004 -rrb- . now , there was a film dealing with real issues , gave us characters we cared about and with whom we sympathized because we knew what brought them together and why they loved each other . compared to those two films , `` the break-up '' seems downright mediocre and superficial , which is exactly what it is .		1		0
i 've just seen this film . it is interesting i grant you that . however , it is so sickening and disturbing that it 's really not worth it . i was amused until it got to the torture scene . then i quite simply turned off my television . now i 've seen a lot of violent movies before -lrb- most of the classics -rrb- but this is really not worth it . at least the `` torture '' / rape scenes in pulp fiction were funny and stylish . this -lrb- in king of the ants -rrb- it has been done 1000 of times and in this particular movie the torturers have absolutely no motive or any motivation to act like they do . none of the actors have acted in a way to make such brutal scenes credible in any way . i fast forwarded through the rest of the movie , and it really broke down there . i actually thought it was a good movie until the scene in the `` shed '' . after that i think most people would lose interest .		1		0
actually it 's not frankenstein 's daughter , it 's his granddaughter . not that it makes any difference . why should it make any difference ? nothing in this cheap , parting shot from the william beaudine makes any difference . the opening shows us narda onyx and steven geray , two mad scientists in their laboratory in a tiny western town , fulminating over their need for new brains and bodies to create life . then there is a long story about jesse james , played by john lupton , whom i remember only as `` sister '' marion in `` battle cry . '' he was the upright marine who was going to write the great american novel . his close friend , cal bolder , a refugee from muscle beach , is wounded in a shoot out with grim , determined , humorless marshal jim davis . a feisty latina , estelita , leads them to the nearest doctors , who are of course the frankenstein couple . they put a new brain into the wounded cal bolder and attempt the same with jesse james but estelita steps in at the last minute and saves his bacon . estelita is a petite and very attractive cuban lady . she was the wife of carlito , the hotel manager , in `` rio bravo , '' and was pretty good . here she emotes to beat the band . she ca n't save this movie , though . nothing could , not even joe bob briggs ' commentary on the dvd . i can hardly bring myself to believe that anyone really went to a drive-in movie to watch a dismal feature like this . who was it aimed at ? the only human being who could find it in any way impressive would have to be an australian aborigine from the central desert who had never heard of movies . of course the sets were cheap , but that 's not enough of an excuse . you can do a lot on a tiny budget , as val lewton showed us at rko , and as other producers and directors proved elsewhere . here , the writing stinks . the plot makes no sense . the actors wear the same clothes in every scene . it 's not bad in a way that evokes laughter . like john wayne 's rabidly `` the conqueror , '' a few minutes of it will satisfy your curiosity . the remaining hour and a half constitute torture .		1		0
today 's comic book movies are supposed to be gritty and dark . but there 's a difference between that and this particular film . the film `` wanted '' is about a young man , wesley -lrb- james mcavoy -rrb- , who is going through a mid-life crisis and ca n't figure out what his purpose is in life . that is until he runs into a woman named fox -lrb- angelina jolie -rrb- , who brings him into a secret society of assassins called `` the fraternity '' . just to point out by the way , that `` the fraternity '' is the lamest name of a group i have ever heard !! why not just call it `` the group '' to be even less specific ? what i could not believe right off the bat was how low the vocabulary level was for this film . what were the scriptwriters doing ... pretending they were teenagers again ? practically every sentence drops the f-bomb , how does this enhance the film any ? yes , sometimes the f-bomb is dropped but not every sentence . that 's just being crass . every character in this film has no dignity whatsoever ... not even the main character 's boss ! then we have the issue of characterization . james mcavoy 's acting is offensive and insulting to all actors in hollywood . what appealed to him in the script ? the fact that he got the chance to curse his mouth off ? yeah real professional . oh and he also says `` i 'm sorry '' way too often and makes a lot of distorted faces which makes me hate him that much more . not to mention for the first half of the film , he 's a crying sack of crap just like shia labeouf from transformers -lrb- 2007 -rrb- . either grow up or go home mcavoy . even angelina jolie 's character was weird . sure jolie 's always sexy but supposedly she based her character off of clint eastwood . so tell me where any of the scenes she played in resembled that . i did n't see one . plus the laws of physics really do n't seem to apply in this film . i can see maybe someone curving a bullet path , but jumping off a building onto another building 500 yards away and make it with no injuries ? these are assassins , not superheroes . mark millar and j.g. jones i think have too many screws loose in their deranged heads . oh , let 's not forget the special effects ! there 's plenty slow motion if you 're into that kind of stuff . that is unless you do n't like seeing it every 5 minutes in every scene . seriously folks , slow motion is good when it 's time for the audience to focus on something and this kind of event rarely occurs . it does n't occur that often here either , but for some reason the filming crew felt it was necessary for every cotton - picking scene ! as for action goes , there 's plenty of bloody gunshots . not that that really made the viewing experience anymore exciting . it felt more numbing than it did entertaining . there was actually one point where two people were having a gunfight but it was n't going anywhere because they were trained so well that their shots kept clashing . how dull . why do n't you shoot twice ? idiots . even danny elfman 's score provided little propulsion in this film . it was n't engaging and it was thrilling . thumbs down elfman . and then to top it off with the greatest insult to all , at the end of the film , james mcavoy has the guts to ask the audience , `` what the f *** have you done lately ? '' . i tell you what mr. mcavoy , i 've wasted two hours of my time watching you play the most annoying character i have ever seen on screen ! i had wanted this film to be cool but in the end , i wanted to beat the hell out of my tv screen . timur bekmambetov 's film is the perfect example of what film trash really is . it needs to be buried in the earth 's core .		1		0
i 've watched the flick , i 've read the reviews . now here 's my own opinion and it 's the most important one ... because it comes from me . this is a horrible , useless and stupid movie ... complete with a plot that does n't work , a bunch of characters that are either self centred , stupid , idiots , freaks or have no real merit to this garbage filled show . when the non-speaking extras have more appeal than anybody on the screen , then you know that the film you are about to see or have seen is at best - total crap . anybody who is associated with this mess and makes a living in the industry would be wise to leave this out of their resume ... because it 's absolute trash at it 's best . even anna faris could n't save this with her doe eyed glaze and goofy grin . the only reason i watched this was for anna faris , because she has a way with per loopy characters which is just mesmerizing - unfortunately , try as hard as she can ... the only time this film was remotely entertaining is when she was on screen , but there was no real story for her character and she seems to disappear midway through . the only star i gave was because anna faris was in it - and had she not been , i would be indebted for stars to place on this crap .		1		0
i hate this movie . i hate the way it looks . i hate the way the actors -lrb- especially leslie caron -rrb- sound . i hate the way it 's dubbed . i hate how irrelevant it is . is it just me , or is there something incredibly distasteful -lrb- not to mention creepy -rrb- to see an 80-something maurice chevalier singing `` thank heaven for little girls '' while ogling them in a park ? maybe pedophilia did n't exist in turn-of-the-century paris . i ca n't believe this gloopy piece of cotton eye candy came out in the same year as orson welles ' `` touch of evil . '' and do n't even get me started on the fact that it won what was then a record number of oscars -lrb- including best picture -rrb- . if nothing else in its dubious history convinces one to ignore the motion picture academy , that should . can anyone honestly tell me they cared at all about how this movie ended ? if you can , i never want to meet you . grade : f		1		0
this film had potential . the first half was funny . the second half suddenly shifted from comedy to drama . the result was a waste of two hours . there was no chemistry between vince and jennifer on screen , so it 's not surprising that their off-screen romance fizzled , too . the movie was a cliché-ridden stench . vince vaughn had the typical `` fun '' job you see in all the chick flicks . he spoke on a microphone to tourists on a tour bus . jennifer aniston 's job was to stand around in an art gallery . wow . several eccentric supporting characters could have been developed , but the movie shifted to vince and jen . jennifer aniston seemed to spend the entire film in humorless negative body language mode while pursing her lips . why is her skin so orange ? she looks like a wearing a wig . the film ended on an ambiguous note , further reinforcing the fact that you wasted your time .		1		0
i suppose i deserve everything i get for watching this in the first place , but it really was awful . none of the elements you 'd expect to find in any action flick were present - pacing , coherence etc. . wise choice from dennis rodman ; if you do n't want to look bad as an actor , star opposite jean claude van damme . his career might have hovered -lrb- as opposed to ` taken off ' -rrb- had he been in this for longer than about 3 minutes . he appears at the start and then disappears ` for the length of a bible ' . it 's an indication of how inept this film was that i 've just read the plot summary and it seemed to bear no relation to the film i was watching . even the press release by sony is hilariously non-descript . i smell something akin to `` the avengers '' - only much , much worse .		1		0
how many times can you be meta in one movie ? whatever your answer is , you 'll still have less than rubber . the whole point of satire is to use irony to mock people , but nobody bothered to explain that to the director . being ironic for the sake of itself is only acceptable for hipsters , and therefore this is as hipster as a movie can get . honestly everything about it just screams , `` do n't you wish you had thought of this first ? '' while denying that fact that nobody did . very little makes sense , story-wise . i 'd have a hard time spoiling it because the movie itself is one huge surprise . -lrb- but not a birthday present surprise , a baby diaper surprise . -rrb- while i think it 's cool how they moved the tire around , that hardly counts as a good enough reason to waste your time on this movie .		1		0
well , i guess you have to be catholic to get anything out of this complete pile of rubbish . the whole premise of the story and presumably the book is absolute cow dung . child of 13 misreads what she sees , witnesses two couples having sex and rather than reveal the truth about her purportedly innocent under age friend , implicates her real ` love ' interest -lrb- obsession -rrb- in a ` crime ' in which her aforementioned innocent friend is a willing player . who are we supposed to be empathising with ? the now old woman who tells us she is dying -lrb- oh yeah - she 's a story teller -rrb- so she 's written a ` novel ' based on her real life experience - except that she 's incorporated a little tidy up where the two victims in this story get something they never even got close to experiencing - i.e. a time of true intimacy . so , its a ` novel ' not an autobiography on this basis is it ? if you 've read this far and think i 'm being too harsh - well i have n't started on the stupid errors in the filming yet . if you want to waste some of your life watching this tripe watch out for the empty war time buses -lrb- unbelievable -rrb- , the crepe bandage stuck straight onto the head wound of a soldier in the hospital and all the other over drawn out and idiotic cinematic ` effects ' . this is complete and utter tripe and should be consigned to obscurity as soon as possible .		1		0
it 's probably me but i find it hard to believe that anyone would take sofia coppola seriously as a film maker if it were n't for her father . i 'm not sure what the premise is here -lrb- a modern teenager transplanted into the french court in the 18th century ? -rrb- . though the raucous contemporary music is clearly intentional , what does it add to the story ? kirsten dunst is n't exactly miscast as marie antoinette ; she is cast without observable rhyme or reason opposite jason schwartzman who likewise is dropped into his role as the from a different planet . what is apparently intended as droll or funny is simply boring . the burlesque of court manners is as overdone as a piece of steak left too long on the . there is absolutely no tension in the film as the french revolution begins and encroaches on the palace and the life within it . are we supposed to care about these people ? they are more alive in the driest history book than in this movie ! the only redeeming feature in this mess is the photography .		1		0
i originally said that this was the most pointless and boring film i have ever seen in my life , but i forced myself to watch it again as i could n't remember it , from director mike figgis -lrb- leaving las vegas -rrb- . basically documentary filmmaker cooper tilson -lrb- dennis quaid -rrb- and his wife leah -lrb- sharon stone -rrb- from new york want to escape to the countryside with their children kristen -lrb- panic room 's kristen stewart -rrb- and jesse -lrb- ryan wilson -rrb- . this dream becomes reality when they find an old decaying mansion still full of the previous owners possessions , and they start trying to make it a proper home . to help with the renovations to the house , and with the recommendation of his girlfriend ruby -lrb- juliette lewis -rrb- , previous owner dale massie -lrb- blade 's stephen dorff -rrb- , recently released from prison , almost forces cooper to hire him to help . as time goes by , and the house seems to be ready for the family to settle in , all sorts of creepy things start happening , including a bunch of deadly snakes through the house , and a dead horse in the swimming pool . wanting to know more about dale , cooper starts looking into his family history and that of the house , and that leads him to dale 's father mr. massie -lrb- christopher plummer -rrb- . in his ill state , the father says some things that lead cooper to the conclusion that dale was put in jail for murdering his own family and dumping them in a pit known as the devil 's throat . in the end , dale comes out of his shell and finally threatens cooper and leah for stealing his house from under his nose , but he is defeated and supposedly the family are happy to stay in the house . also starring dana as sheriff ferguson . i think maybe the reason i thought it was terrible last time was because i did n't pay full attention to what was going on , and when i did , i still was n't impressed with this terribly boring and pointless suspense thriller . poor !		1		0
no one goes into a david lynch movie expecting a normal viewing experience . but what do you come out with when you 've seen a movie that a road movie with `` bonnie and clyde '' , `` the wizard of oz '' and `` blue velvet '' -lrb- lynch 's previous film -rrb- ? headache , nausea , dizziness and slurred speech , that 's what . this is not a movie , it 's a litmus test for how far a movie can go and how much it can get away with . and obviously , the mpaa did n't let it get away with too much . but enough , to be sure . as sailor -lrb- cage -rrb- and lula -lrb- dern -rrb- make their way through a bizarre world replete with oddball characters , twisted situations and nihilistic scenes of violence , it 's kind of hard to juxtapose these with scenes of glinda the good witch and dern clicking her heels to get back home . lynch tries to make a joke of the whole thing : blood , guts , severed hands and heads and all , but this is the kind of humor you 're more apt to get if you 're into jokes about death , dismemberment and a lack of overall morals . the only scene i did like in this whole mess is set in a dance club , where cage roughs up a guy trying to put the moves on dern , makes him apologize , has the guy get himself a beer and then jumps up with the band and breaks into an elvis song while the girls in the club squeal and scream for joy . seeing cage sing like elvis is worth the price of admission itself . almost . one star . for sheer guts , this movie has no equals , thank goodness . but though it 's `` wild at heart '' , its `` heart '' is not in the right place . just like its brain .		1		0
i do n't love the original . nor am i one to claim that the only way a remake can be good is if it does n't deviate from its source in the slightest . heck , i 'm not even going to insist that the atmospheric , deliberately paced , skillfully built up method of the '80 film is the only way to do this . what i am going to argue is that if you 're going to copy as much of what you 're going by as this does , you might want to try for a similar overall feel to it . you know , as opposed to just taking all that seemed to work that time around and stringing together scenes so as to allow for about all you can possibly muster of them , with the occasional change . honestly , even that far , this does n't completely lose . no , i think where this completely tanks , if you ignore the way some of the `` creepy '' situations come off supposedly commonplace -lrb- ? -rrb- to the leads , the lazy and obvious delivering of exposition -lrb- was any attempt at all made to conceal it ? -rrb- for quite a bit of it , the apparent lack of memorable lines as well as even a single genuinely impressive performance ... no , where it ceases forward momentum is in one simple , unfortunate attribute : it ai n't scary . not particularly , if at all . it 's not the pg-13 ; the ring did masterful with the same rating . it 's not directed with the proper understanding and care for horror . i have n't seen anything else by wainwright , but i imagine carpenter could take him to school on the genre . for now , us fans will have to re-watch classics , as the most terrifying thing in the current world of movies is how significantly awful the majority of the recent ones are . i recommend this mainly as mst3k fodder , and/or for those members the young crowd who are satisfied with music and slang that 's in , as well as half-naked members of the other gender scampering around . 1/10		1		0
this is the worst marvel movie excluding `` the punisher '' -lrb- 1989 -rrb- & `` captain america '' -lrb- 1990 -rrb- . when people go see a hulk movie they expect `` hulk smash !!!!!!!!!!!! '' but in this its `` hulk roar & jump around country '' no action no nothing . the people which liked this are fans of the old tv show with ` bill bixby ' . ang lee has no idea how to make a comic book movie & if he thinks he does `` hey ang where is the sequel ? '' i speak on behalf of all hulk fans . the plot is the origin of bruce banner 's hulk & the military goes after him for no reason . if anyone thought `` ghost rider '' was a horrible career choice for sam elliott clearly you have n't seen this movie . who in hollywood casted eric bana as hulk he was so wooden but hey this guy originated his career in `` full frontal '' so how he ever became a movie star is with `` aliens '' & `` big foot '' as one of the mysteries of the universe . jennifer connelly ... well i ca n't say much about her she is the only thing in this movie close to descent in this hulk movie besides the music score by danny elfman but hey he also did the music score to terminator salvation . josh lucas is the worst actor out of the whole movie & i can swear i saw a splinter in his face . nick nolte has made some of the worst career choices i mean he turned down the role of han solo in star wars & indiana jones in raiders of the lost ark i heard he was once on drugs & him actually signing on to this movie proves it . people might say `` your too harsh '' but i am a marvel comic book fan so which one can have backup evidence to prove this is like `` shrek 5 : the entry to our world '' . one last thing when the hulk gets angrier he gets bigger who thought of that ? that is the worst technical `` achievement '' of the hulk i have seen .		1		0
and so it continues , in monotonous , predictable , nasty fashion . a pointless cameo appearance from jamie lee curtis reveals that the decapitated body at the end of the dreadful ` halloween : h20 ' was n't michael myers after all , but a mute paramedic wearing the iconic white mask -lrb- he did n't get out of the car -rrb- . from this desperate revelation the movie somehow manages to skid further downhill , as once curtis finally exits the series thanks to a laughable scene in which she captures michael and then does something incredibly stupid , the film becomes a ham-fisted medley of moments from ` blair witch ' , ` aliens ' and every slasher movie you 've ever seen . the plot : internet entrepreneur busta rhymes -lrb- likeable at first , awful later on -rrb- ensconces a group of kids in myers 's childhood home on halloween , fits their anodyne heads with , adds a fake myers stand-in and broadcasts the results to the internet . presumably the scenes in which viewers scream and shout when the real myers turns up are intended as a on the film 's events , but unfortunately for hack director rick rosenthal , who also perpetrated ` halloween ii ' , the real audience is more likely to roll over and go to sleep because he 's made a boring , clichéd , dopey , ineffective lump of a film that ends the series not with a whimper but a bilious splutter . just some of the film 's problems : in the preceding film curtis was reliant on medication and booze thanks to the torment she suffered at the hands of her brother , but can now think clearly enough to secrete her pills in a doll and rig up a rope and pulley system to catch him , despite having killed an innocent man , which i would imagine would screw her up even more . an reference to ` pulp fiction ' not only distracted me with thoughts of how great ` pulp fiction ' is but made me wonder why i was n't watching it rather than this thing . the few decent ideas on offer , such as the false michael and the contact with the outside world being the only hope for the troubled teens , are bungled so comprehensively that the film bypasses frustration and just plain dies . i laughed at the fake rubber head that comes bouncing down the stairs . i cringed at the hopelessly noncommittal performance of lead plank bianca kajlich . i sighed as the movie expects us to believe michael has died . again . i rolled my eyes as it 's revealed not to be the case . again . i wasted my time watching this movie and i wasted more writing about it . do n't make the same mistake .		1		0
i can see how bette midler might need a job , but why would billy crystal stoop to a role like this ? `` parental guidance '' was grueling to sit through . whoever came up with the storyline should reconsider his career path . maybe it 's all right if you 're starting out in screen writing and this is a rough first draft , but to dress it up for release over the christmas weekend ? that 's highway robbery if not consumer fraud . counting snacks at our nyc multiplex , my 10-year-old and i got clipped for $ ! odd-couple grandparents spend weekend babysitting obnoxious trio of rug rats while kids ' parents try to copulate during rare , out-of-town trip ? -lrb- oh , i am just slapping my knee ! -rrb- as a long-married couple , crystal and midler share nothing in common but an obvious reliance on hair dye . crystal just phones in his lines and the long midler tries way too hard , missing no opportunity to mug for the lens . and almost every minute spent with the children -- gratingly named harper , tucker , and barker -- is an ordeal . one of the kids stutters and is bullied -- would you consider that funny ? this film 's `` writers '' apparently did . but i found kyle harrison breitkopf to be the most squirm-worthy grandchild . calling grandpa artie `` '' is n't humorous the first time around but we must endure this alleged witticism incessantly . and then there are the urination and defecation gags . gag me with a spoon ! as if all this were n't bad enough , the film takes time to ridicule the foreign-born . lovely american actress rhoda impersonates a russian violin teacher , and gedde watanabe provides a -lrb- albeit slightly entertaining -rrb- caricature of a owner . my pre-adolescent son did actually enjoy this film . i could n't wait to go home . shame on you , crystal , for lending your name to this utter piece of `` doody '' !		1		0

spoiler - to legendary creatures fans , you will be disappointed , i ` m read on why below when i rented this at video store i thought this would be great because its about the jersey devil and i ` m a big fan of legendary creatures so i thought the last broadcast was going to be awesome but it failed badly and i ` m so disappointed that i wasted my money and my time ! in the tradition of your annoying neighbor ` s camcorder session the last broadcast is a thrill to see not in the way of great acting or special effects or even the quality of a a & e bio but in the way of a public access way the last broadcast starts out it looks promising and even through thirty minutes of it still seems like it has but when the movie comes close to a hour and the slightly mentions the legendary jersey devil and it seems like the people that made this waste of film wanted and all of the people in the town to be on was like they forgot what the story was about and wrote the script as the film was rolling and especialy the end seemed like it was written at the very last minute just before i rented it.i mean the last broadcast seemed like it was a live broadcast tour of some town in jersey . some of you people maybe wondering about why the last broadcast is a bad because it sucks and here is just a few reasons why it sucks so bad and yes to the year this piece of garbage was made it was filmed before the blair witch project but i really don ` t care cause both films are home movies and when i watched them i think what did i just thought of these home video movies is beyond me.i guess its somebody that has a low as low as thier don ` t know but i do know this , if you are going to make a film about something scary and/or legendary then show the dang thing and stop me with stuff like tlb and ! 1 . this movie was about the jersey devil , wasn ` t if it was , i didn ` t see it , did you ? 2 . the camra work is horrible and the camra seems like it needs its battery charged and the color changed and the lighting is very dimmed and most of the time when you watch the last broadcast you wonder what your looking at because most of the not so important scenes are poorly shown with bad editing . 3 . when we meet the town you forget that your watching the last broadcast for awhile and you think you are watching the 10 ` o clock news on what ever . 4 . most of the actors -lrb- if i can call them that -rrb- seemed shy to the camra and/or didn ` t want any part of the last broadcast for some reason.i wonder what it could have been ? 5 . did i mention there is no jersey devil ? the bottomline is this : blair witch fans will be glad to see its but fans like myself of legendary creatures will be very disappointed because there is no monster , no creature , no jersey devil , just your normal home movie on a video that you can rent at your local video ` m very displeased with the last broadcast and i hope it is the last broadcast and won ` t have a sequel and i give the last broadcast a huge 0 !		1		0
ugh . what has happened to the horror genre ? `` the uninvited '' looked like it might deliver and there for i saw it . crap , what a waste of $ 4.50 ! i wish i could have that money back right about now . i was expecting a thriller that would me keep me guessing , maybe surprise me and of course scare me just a little at least . i was let down . we get a not so suspenseful ` thriller/horror ' that to be honest did n't scare me one little bit . seriously . the performances are pathetic in my opinion and by half way through this flick i have already lost interest sad to say . there is some comic relief , one scene , including a vibrator -lrb- why would she hold another woman 's probably used several times vibrator ? -rrb- , which does n't fit in . the vibrator was probably employed to wake up the audience members who , like me , we 're falling asleep half -- way through . sorry , did n't work . the ending is what some people find so enjoyable about this flick , but i find it confusing as hell . so the girl is mental and she was imagining the entire story -lrb- but killed her dad 's new wife in the process -rrb- ... but the serial killer is right across from her in her asylum room ? wtf ?! so . . what the hell ? i am still confused but find no interest in looking this film up more than i have to . i just wanted to warn you all before you waste your money like unfortunate me : -lrb-		1		0
i never really was interested in watching this but when it got so much publicity , i thought it would be worth a shot to give it a look . i should have saved my money . i do n't really find a film featuring , punk college kids that appealing . the movie might have been effective at what it aimed to do - to scare people - but it was just too sleazy for me . of the three leads , the girl is probably the most annoying because of her smugness . my main complaint is really not the movie so much as it was the marketing . this movie was viewed by millions of teenagers , and that 's what the producers wanted . that , along with the college crowd , was their target audience . hey , as far as college kids seeing this , i have no problem , but not high school kids . to promote a film to that young a crowd - which it undeniably did - and have over 130 f - words , over 60 uses of `` sh-t , '' 20 usages of the lord 's name in vain and tons of other profanities - all in a paltry 80 minutes - is absolutely ridiculous and just plain wrong . i recognize the inventive film-making . they make it look - effectively so - that the kids in the story are filming some sort of documentary . it certainly has that feel to it and it 's very realistic in that regard . it does n't rely on gore but on a psychological level for the horror . it shows the evilness of witchcraft and the occult . no problem ... but ... i still remember my local library having an entire wall on where the computers are located , promoting this film , reading `` hey , kids - it 's blair witch month . celebrate with us ... blah , blah , blah . '' i am not making that up . unbelievable , but that 's our liberal libraries these days . i guess that 's what still `` sticks in my craw '' about this movie . it should have been promoted `` for adults only , '' but it was n't .		3		0
'd - tox ' or ` eye see you ' , how ever you want to call it , is very serious and thus for unintentionally some what funny old school action film . and by old school i mean , that it has n't got any fancy tricks in its sleeve , just standard action straight from the pits of late 70 's and and 80 's . be said 'd - tox ' could have been a great action comedy in the sense , that the whole premises for the movie is a bit silly . sure , there 's nothing silly about the serial killer or the alcohol problem of malloy -lrb- sylvester stallone -rrb- , but the rehabilitation center is ludicrous : it 's in the middle of nowhere -lrb- that 's not the problem -rrb- ex military base with badly maintained heating systems , electricity and phone lines . and further more there are n't enough staff and the staff present is rather unprofessional to put it mildly . it all is just too unbelievable : would a centre like that really start working without professional staff ? as i said 'd - tox ' might have worked better as an action comedy but now as it is poorly done writing mixed with awkward editing of blue memories and too serious style of directing make it below average and very predictable from the beginning to the end . score : 3 out of 10 . very old school action mixed with poorly done melodrama . camp score : 6 out of 10 . the ending alone makes this a camp classic .		3		0
jamie babbit 's `` the quiet , '' dealing with the difficult subject of sexual abuse , is an ambitious film that shot for the stars and ended up tumbling down a cliff . the main downfall of this film is that the talents of the actors are not commensurate to the demands made upon them by their challenging roles . the character of the abused teenager nina , for example , is certainly interesting , but elisha cuthbert can not play this character effectively . cuthbert had to portray a tortured soul struggling not to explode in a rage . but cuthbert could n't do it . she appears more like a sulking and obnoxious teenager experiencing puberty rather than a girl who is unusually troubled and depressed . and because we can not imagine cuthbert 's nina as troubled and depressed , it becomes more difficult to understand why she would explode in a rage . in addition to that dilemma , the angry scenes come across as something from a cheap theatre play with third-rate actors . instead of convincing the audience that she was angry , sadistic , and potentially violent , cuthbert came across as an actor playing a role . in other words , a film 's success depends on its ability to deceive the audience into believing that the people on screen are real . but in `` the quiet , '' we were not seeing nina , but rather elisha cuthbert pretending to be nina -- and that 's why this film does not work . but that was not the only problem with this film . the editing was poorly done . there are scenes in `` the quiet '' that should not be there because they distract from the central premise -lrb- which is the story of the sexually abused nina -rrb- . i am referring to the sex scene involving dot -lrb- camilla belle -rrb- and one of the boys in school and another scene where dot and the same boy are at a cafeteria engaging in dumbed down conversation . then there are the scenes with camilla belle playing the piano which seem to lack any purpose . i like classical music , but how does beethoven 's moonlight sonata relate in any way to the subject of this film . perhaps babbit felt that if the classically trained camilla played beethoven , then somehow that would save the film . she was wrong . finally there are the boring scenes with nina as the cheerleader on the basketball court or in a cinema looking back at dot . finally there is the problem of the script . why for instance was it necessary for elisha cuthbert 's nina to dress in a sexy cheerleader 's outfit in front of her sexually abusive father . for a film dealing with sexual abuse , scenes displaying cuthbert 's sex appeal come across as shamelessly exploitative and by implication even supportive of incest and sexual abuse -lrb- even if that was not the intention -rrb- . the nude scenes with eddie falco , who plays nina 's mother -lrb- she did so much better in the sopranos -rrb- , are among the most uncomfortable that i have seen . then there is camilla belle 's performance as dot , the supposedly deaf and dumb girl who moved into nina 's house . we know -- in fact we are told -- that we must to feel very sorry for dot , because she lost her father in a car accident . but i did not buy into that sentimental nonsense , because the car accident and the disability are cheap ploys to generate sympathy for a character that does not move us in any way . daniel day lewis ' christie brown character in `` my left foot '' moved us because his feelings and frustrations seemed real . but camilla dot 's belle is dull , uninspired and depressing to watch . there is no reason to care about what she says as evidenced by the fact that her observations are forgettable . this too is a big problem for this film because camilla belle narrates for this entire movie . but she has nothing important or interesting say throughout ; her performance is dreary and indifferent . the only thing i can credit this movie for is director jamie babbit had the guts to go all the way with this ambitious project when more frail souls -lrb- influenced largely by monetary concerns -rrb- would have given up or tried to find some way to cut their losses . `` the quiet '' was babbit 's great gamble and it failed . belle and cuthbert were poorly chosen for their roles . the plot was flawed . the cinematography , gloomy . the music , all wrong . `` the quiet '' is a failure , but it is also an ambitious failure because babbit cared enough about this film to try as hard as she could to make it work even when it was clear that it could not work .		3		0
i am a big fan of russell crowe , but this was a bad movie . the story was convoluted , hard to follow and boring . nothing much happens in the movie for long stretches . the action scenes were standard fare , nothing very interesting . none of the characters stood out , except for the father of the maid marion character , and he was n't around for that long . to be honest , i fell asleep during the movie a couple times , and only woke up when the action scenes returned . the movie is almost two and a half hours , and much of it is boring dialogs and dull characters and story line . russell crowe looked like he is out of shape in the movie and did n't seem to be trying very hard . maybe he was bored of the movie too . hopefully he will do a better movie next time because this one was a stinker .		3		0
urban legends : final cut takes place at a film school , and apparently the filmmakers behind the latest entry into the tired , damn-near exhausted teen horror genre could benefit from a few remedial filmmaking courses . the plot behind urban legends , as much of the entire movie , is a direct ripoff of the same year 's scream 3 , as much of the story takes place during the making of a movie . while it manages to echo the entire trilogy , it also meshes together tons of elements and scenes that have been employed with either great or marginal success in other films . the opening totally copies final destination , the premise is a bastardized version of the scream trilogy , and there is one sequence that manages to rip off blair witch and friday the 13th in a single transition . maybe first-time director john ottman thought these would come across as homages to other successful horror flicks - or maybe the writers were simply lazy and wanted to capitalize on the success of the others . and so , the movie plods along , as predictable as watching the zapruder film . the cast of young faces all seem to be trying their best as they stumble through scenes that lack any freshness , and joey lawrence -lrb- here credited joseph lawrence , as if he is attempting to step away from the pall that will forever be cast on him from `` blossom '' -rrb- shows us what a lack of talent he truly possesses . 3 out of 10 .		3		0
the critics are gaga over this , but neither myself nor my 6 year old were . i was disturbed by how marlin was ridiculed for being -lrb- understandably -rrb- over-protective . while the `` can do '' attitude toward his handicap is heartening , nemo remains the same brat he was when he put the story into motion . `` nemo '' struck me as anti-family -lrb- strange to say about a `` family picture '' -rrb- in how the parent was the one was expected to grow up , not the child . it had some scary moments . the `` whale talking '' got old real fast . but , the anti-american jab -lrb- which got the biggest laugh -rrb- was outrageous . hollywood hates bush so much , it has to shoehorn its politics into the one place where it does n't belong ! here 's a weird idea : how about letting children have a childhood , and save the stuff for the grown ups ?		3		0
the world is under attack , by massive -lrb- tr -rrb- ipods . stuck in the middle as usual is cindy campbell , who is looking after a shut-in woman . the house she lives in is haunted by a boy ghost . next door is tom ryan , divorced and not the greatest dad . as the aliens attack , tom needs to protect his son and daughter . the fourth movie to come out from the scary movie franchise , you know the formula already . the first scary movie , while no great piece of cinema , was a satire on the teen slasher films , mixing in old classic one . by the second one , the wayans brothers knew to let it go , as the material was already stretched thin . as david zuckerman picked up the franchise , it has just crumbled to pieces . scary movie 4 is a parody of itself . any satire that was left in scary movie 2 , has become slap stick humor of brainless comedy . it 's like funniest home video show , with constant jokes of people getting hit in the head ; over and over . scary movie 4 lacks in a story arc . the situations are one random scene interchanged , with no connection between one another . not just referencing other films , the writers jump on the george bush bandwagon and tom cruise 's couch dance on the oprah show . returning to her signature role , anna faris has to be the queen of air-head characters . regina hall also returns from her role as brenda . craig bierko flounders around the screen , with a host of cameos from dr. phil , chingy , michael madsen and others . for a franchise that started as a passable satire , scary movie 4 has turned it into nothing but a film for early adolescences to say , ` he got hit on the head ' .		3		0
bloodsucking freaks sucked , hard ! this is supposed to be a `` cult '' movie , but i ca n't imagine any group of people who think this flick is good . granted it had plenty of nudity , but damn ! it really sucked . its about a group of s & m theatre actors who get their victims through the black market and torture them on stage . the audience is totally unaware that the people are really being murdered in front of them . the box asks `` is this hard gore or exploitation ? '' really its neither its just hard core suck ! if you want hard gore , go get dead alive . if you want pure suck get bloodsucking freaks .		3		0
the beginning of the movie is surprisingly okay , but it goes down hill from there on . a low budget italian film , which needs another rewrite , and better acting . the director did a decent job with the small budget , and actors for this movie . he set a mood , and tries to artistically convey some of the scenes . like many other low budget horror films , they add a lot of cheesey to it ie . gory effects and nude swimming . in the end , i hate to admit i watched this garbage , and should have avoided it like a pack of zombies , but boredom made me rent it .		3		0
ever so often you 'll find a novel that has been maimed so terrible that it is impossible to recognize it - even in a movie . this is such a novel . fortunately it is not sandra bullocks fault . a word of advice to scriptwriters . keep your fingers away from the good stuff . let the author do it .		3		0
this is a terrible film , there 's no two ways about it . the script is bad , the actors miscast , and it fails to give any real insight into the tudor era . i can forgive historical inaccuracy in decent films , but this is far from a decent film . my biggest disappointment is the lack of scope . the budget was clearly blown on making the costumes and hiring the actors , because the entire film takes place in a dingy mansion . scenes set outside are few and far between . even the key execution scene , which would have seen hundreds of spectators , has about half a dozen extras standing around instead . johansson is vacuous and portman made me cringe at times . eric bana is probably the worst actor yet to play henry viii -lrb- and he knows it -rrb- , but at least he has little to do . the best actor in the film , eddie redmayne -lrb- of pillars of the earth -rrb- is wasted as a pageboy . i find philippa gregory a dry , unengaging author anyway , but i 'd hoped this would be a decent adaptation . how wrong i was ! as for the bit where anne is prepared to commit incest with her own brother - ludicrous ! they should have just brought in cromwell making up evidence in his torture chamber , at least that would be closer to the truth .		3		0
why would anyone watch a movie that features seth green as a gangster or any movie with vin diesel for that matter ? personally , i had very little interest in this film , but i wanted to see it because of john malkovich . he is so funny and no one plays the bad guy , better than he does . as always , malkovich was brilliant , in an otherwise awful movie . knockaround guys is the story of four gangster 's kids , who are tired of being nobodies , and decide it 's time to make a score of their own . a score that they manage to royally screw up . it 's a good premise for a movie and it was written pretty well . they did a great job casting veteran actors like malkovich and dennis hopper to play the crime bosses , but they really blew it when it came to casting their kids . seth green is n't believable at all , seriously , i think the little kid in the beginning of the movie could kick his . they try to cover up the fact that he does n't fit the role by making him a drug addict , but it does n't work out . vin diesel is another one , he may be terrific in crazy action films that hardly have any lines , but when the role is something of substance , and requires a personality , diesel is the last person who should be cast . he is one of the worst actors i 've ever seen , but there is a bright side . when arnold schwarzenegger first started acting , he was pretty terrible too , but after gaining some experience , he blossomed into a superstar , who gave us some great films . i hope the same can be said about diesel in a few years , until then , unless you 're a die hard john malkovich fan , you can avoid seeing this giant mess of a film .		3		0
the thing is . . it 's just not entirely entertaining . maybe i expected more and had my hopes up so it 's probably partly my fault but monsters vs. aliens is just an average family movie . it 's got some amusing moments , a few scenes that will ... get you to chuckle a bit , kids will love it , parents will love it , but the rest of us however will be saying ` okay , next ! ' thank god it has the 3d because otherwise i 'd be staring at my wristwatch from beginning to the end . i 'm okay with 3d movie , i welcome any awesomeness that could enhance our movie watching experience but if the movie has humor that misses the target and a story way too easy for our intelligence , not even 3d could fully save the day . i respect the monsters vs. aliens trying to teach our young viewers the lesson of not looking at people like freaks or different because you never know , they might be the ones to keep the world from getting blown up by aliens . the movie uses the blue character bob as its poster boy because all the marketing indicates that he 's the comic relief but i find the president to be the most hilarious , for some reason i do n't know why , but stephen colbert gets the best lines in the movie . the action ` roller coaster ride ' sequences are just ok , your typical scenes that you 've felt in other movies before , it does n't have that much of a thrill if you ask me . reese witherspoon 's animated character , susan is supposed to be the lead star and yet in the end we could care less for what would happen to her . i 'm impressed with keifer sutherland 's peculiar voice as the angry general , hearing the voice alone i would n't have figured out it was kiefer . i do n't wan na drag this review , point is ... monsters vs. aliens is pointless , predictable , and over-hyped . you wo n't miss a thing if you never watch it . you should n't be surprised because dreamworks animation is a hit-and-miss situation unlike pixar that always lives up to its promise . -- rama 's screen --		3		0
while not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works , this slow-moving , repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half , but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement . to be sure , the actors are above average - considering this is an argento movie - and some moments show the director 's visual skills , but whole sequences should 've been cut and , basically , it 's just the same exploitative trash as ever , wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity . 3 out of 10 genetic disorders		3		0
in director jean negulesco 's 1946 film `` humoresque '' , john garfield plays a violin virtuoso , and joan crawford , his neurotic high-society patroness . paul boray -lrb- garfield -rrb- is an unlikely virtuoso , the son of an immigrant that grew up poor in early twentieth century new york tenement . when he is a young boy of about 8 , -lrb- paul as a young child was incidentally played by robert blake -rrb- he chooses a second hand violin as his birthday gift from the local variety store , and the rest is history . after attending the institute of music , he begins to try to forge a career in music . but it is the depression and jobs are scarce , until he attends a party with his piano-playing friend sid -lrb- oscar jeffers -rrb- thrown by helen wright -lrb- crawford -rrb- and her husband , both patrons of the arts and general lovers of la vie boheme . helen takes paul under her wing and arranges his career for him , and the two inevitably fall in love . the relationship is not easy , as she is a neurotic , married alcoholic and he is a gruff man who very easily dumped his girlfriend -lrb- joan chandler -rrb- for his career and helen , and has a mother who is unnaturally concerned about him . high melodrama ensues until the relationship becomes a matter of life and death . `` humoresque '' was the first film i have seen that paired crawford and garfield -lrb- i believe they have done three -rrb- and i did not feel any kind of chemistry between the two characters . their scenes together were very flat , and since it appeared that crawford was trying to heighten the drama in order to save the film , she ended up grossly overacting . separately , crawford is luminous as always , and really is a good actress ; she was just wasted on this simple script and with the wrong costar . garfield is a really good actor , he is just completely unappealing to me , and i feel completely miscast in this film . it was best said by a partygoer in one scene , `` i do n't believe you play the violin , you look more like a boxer . '' joan chandler , however , was refreshing in her -lrb- ridiculously small -rrb- role as his girlfriend gina ; the only other film i 've seen her in was `` rope '' where she was somewhat obnoxious . it is also a good thing that i like classical music because there were plenty of long scenes featuring violin and piano performances . however , they could have been shaved down tremendously in favor of an actual story . -lrb- we get it , he can play -rrb- and among the more glaring plot holes involved gina . in one instance , she is forgotten for a half hour , leading me to assume she was out of the picture , but then she shows up at his debut . twenty minutes pass , and we find out that they are still dating only because his mom tells him that he stood her up for their date that night . the mother was another interesting character ; she was creepily concerned , giving weird looks , etc. that were completely unwarranted , considering she did n't even know what her son 's situation was yet . meanwhile , garfield looks about 40 -lrb- but was only about 27 at the time -rrb- , and she is ridiculously involved in his life . if this were meant to be a significant plot device that would be one thing ; but there was no background for the behavior . probably one of the most bothersome things worth mentioning about the film was actually one of the actors , oscar levant , who plays paul 's best friend sid . he was just plain obnoxious . everything he says is a wry , sarcastic comment , a characteristic that gets old after about two lines . by the fourth line i just rolled my eyes and thought , `` nobody talks like this in real life '' and by the middle of the film i found that i was bracing myself every time he was about to open his mouth . a fantastic piano player , yes , but his shtick got really old really fast . hilariously , paul was about 8 when he first met sid , so about twenty years pass before the end of the film , however sid looks exactly the same . i love a great classic drama , and really like melodrama , but it either has to be good -lrb- some douglas sirk films or a film like `` mildred pierce '' -rrb- or decent , but -lrb- the rest of douglas sirk 's films or a film like `` now voyager '' -rrb- . `` humoresque '' falls into neither category , unfortunately , and is therefore just bad melodrama , pretty much one of the worst genres out there . i give the film points for crawford because she 's just so good , but this film was a bad fit for everyone involved . `` humoresque '' is high melodrama with lines worth snickering at , but is sorely lacking the class its peers have . 3/10 -- shelly		3		0
this just might possibly be the worst film adaptation created based upon , or inspired by , a book in the history of film itself . the cat in the hat will , thankfully , survive this ridiculous excuse for a movie . while the cat in the hat himself will live on as a timeless children 's favorite this movie will hopefully be quickly forgotten and have the dvd copies put into a trash compactor . what they did to the cat in the hat is unforgivable . adult themes . blatant commercialism , including a shameless plug for universal studios -lrb- i wonder how much that set them back -rrb- and the pop music they put on the soundtrack for the movie . the jokes might have been funny if this movie was n't supposed to be based upon the cat in the hat . mike meyers performance might have been considered brilliant if this was n't supposed to be a movie about one of the most beloved child characters ever . but we ca n't say that because this movie was a travesty . the twisting of the cat in the hat to a perverted , ill humored , chaos weaving creature that appeared to be ready to take a baseball bat to a small child , is unbelievable . the cat making jokes about whores , and nearly giving a tongue bath to a garden hoe in the same 2-second bit ? what were they thinking ? obviously they did n't think about much . the movie would probably terrify most small children , whom you would have expected this movie to be targeted towards . this is not a movie to take the kids to or to show them on video/dvd . this movie should be shown in every film school in the world as a shining example of how to not make a child 's storybook into a movie . i could say more but i 'll give myself and ulcer and i 'll need some . all i can say is this movie was pitiful . i 'd rather watch leonard part 6 again instead of this garbage .		3		0
naked lunch starts in new york city in 1953 where bill lee -lrb- peter weller -rrb- works as a bug exterminator , however he is having some difficulty as someone is taking his bug powder that he uses to kill them . bill finds out that his wife joan -lrb- judy davis -rrb- is taking it & injecting herself with it , then strangely bill is contacted by a large bug type creature that informs bill he has to kill his wife joan because she is an enemy agent . bill flees new york city & ends up in morocco with his insect type writer that he writes his reports on , from this point on things get even weirder for bill & us ... this canadian , british & japanese co-production was written & directed by david cronenberg based on the controversial novel of the same name by william s. burroughs , i am a fan of david cronenberg & his work in general but i have to say that i think naked lunch is his least enjoyable film as far as i am concerned . cronenberg 's films are usually very visual & have deep meaning & are just great but naked lunch is a total mess that i personally did n't get & am not sure who it was meant to appeal to . do n't get me wrong films do n't have to mean anything , they do n't have to have deep life changing messages or be thought provoking but naked lunch is an almost unfathomable film . the basic plot as far as i can make out is that some bug exterminator starts getting high on his bug powder & then writes some bizarre book he titles naked lunch while having lots of bizarre hallucinations & starts to suffer from severe paranoia & concocts a strange world of his own in which he becomes some sort of spy or agent or something . for me a film has to be enjoyable & entertaining , if it is n't then what the hell is the point in watching it ? naked lunch was neither enjoyable or entertaining to me so while some may love it & find all sorts of obscure meanings & parallels i thought it was just a meaningless mess with no direction or narrative & at almost two hours long it felt like it went on forever . while watching naked lunch i just kept thinking ` what the hell is going on ' & once it had finished i was left thinking ` what the hell have i just spent two hours of my life watching ' , basically i was less than satisfied & left totally cold . the film is stylish & visually impressive as one would expect from cronenberg , i ca n't help but feel that it 's no coincidence that the orifice 's that the bugs speak out of look like a talking anus . there 's nothing in the way of horror or gore really , there are a few bug like creatures & a couple of sex scenes but this is surprisingly tame considering the source material & the director . the film has polished production values & looks nice enough , naked lunch was going to be shot in tangier in morocco but because of the war that broke out in iraq it ended up being shot completely in toronto in ontario in canada . apparently peter weller turned down the lead role in robocop 3 -lrb- 1993 -rrb- to star in this , ian holm , julian sands & roy scheider round off a good cast . naked lunch is a film that i did n't like at all , there just did n't seem to be any point or message or reason for it 's existence . as a big cronenberg fan i can say this is my least favourite of his films that i have seen , over long & meaningless pretty much sums naked lunch up for me .		3		0
unbreakable simply sucks you into a comic book world . for once , the technical aspects of a movie are brilliant . it works for when you want to avoid the actual reality that everything else mainly stinks to the core . if not for the director 's style and approach to unbreakable , there would be no praise from me whatsoever in a movie that shamelessly has a young actor adjust his arm so you can see the whole tropicana carton . the acting is horrible to say the least . to see how the actors adjust and flow to the different perspectives of people and objects through camera angles and movement is either clever or completely embarrassing . unbreakable speaks volumes about itself , but unlike 90 % of the other user comments , let 's keep it minimum . david dunn survives a horrible train wreck , and everyone is shocked to see him not have one scratch when he is the only survivor . it catches the attention of one elijah price , a comic book art gallery guru who wants to bring out the superhero in dave . the climax of unbreakable is extremely well done and the twist was a clever one . but i doubt anybody would want to pay movie theater prices to spend an hour and a half of their time waiting for what the last ten minutes are going to be . you could be oohed and by the different camera angles , but saving those bucks to see fireworks with a grand finale would be a cheaper idea . and your time would not be wasted . unbreakable is a subtle mess , with hilarious drama and a sense of wondering where the time went .		3		0
some things you just ca n't recreate , no matter how hard you try . woodstock , for instance . in this case , it 's `` animal house '' . they can rip off -lrb- or pay homage to -rrb- the original all they want , but they just ca n't recapture the spirit . animal house worked because it was fresh and new , but this movie , made 25 years -lrb- and countless other animal movies -rrb- later , just reeks of staleness and recycled ideas . in addition to swiping the central plot from `` animal house '' -lrb- uptight dean resorts to dirty tricks to drive wild fraternity off campus -rrb- , it also borrows shamelessly from `` revenge of the nerds '' , `` back to school '' , and a ton of other movies , such that there 's barely a single scene that is n't borrowed in some form from an earlier movie . take , for example , will ferrell shooting himself with a tranquilizer dart , which is similar to a scene where he is shot in the butt with a tranquilizer by a monkey in `` jay and silent bob strike back '' . it was , to put it bluntly , a lot funnier the first time around . and that applies to pretty much the entire movie . most of it is n't very funny , and even the parts that are were funnier before , elsewhere . 3/10		3		0
the story starts with goku -lrb- justin chatwin of war of the worlds -rrb- , who sets out upon his grandfather gohan 's -lrb- randall kin -rrb- dying request to meet the master roshi -lrb- chow yun fat of crouching tiger , hidden dragon -rrb- and unite all seven dragon balls of which he has one . in order to avoid the villain lord piccolo -lrb- james marsters of buffy slayer -rrb- from succeeding in his objective to use the dragon balls to take over the world . and goku 's seeks is to get the mystical dragonballs before the lord of evil does . but in the meantime , the super powerful piccolo along with his hoodlum are preparing to destroy everything that lives , and only the valiant goku helped by bulma -lrb- emmy rossum of phantom of opera -rrb- have the power to stop them . meanwhile goku falls in love with his school mate chi chi -lrb- jamie chung -rrb- . dragon ball are basically numerous spectacular fight-scenes with a tiny bit of plot movement , full of repetitive dialogue and flashy blasts of light and energy , but that has n't prevented kids and teenagers from eating them up . it contains cartoon violence and minor sexual innuendo than anime series . occasionally features stunted and disjointed action , as well as the hilarious but quite conventional characters fitting partially to animated series . the abundant computer generator images , which labor mightily to reproduce the source materials in some impressive scenes and eye-popping look . these adventures can be good for novices and youngsters age 10 should drawn into the story but not for the established fans . james wong adapts the rich myth of the dragonball series that grew from a manga into various popular animated series by means of hundreds episodes that are brought to life with this 20th century fox and stephen chow -lrb- kung fu hustler -rrb- production . james wong is a good writer -lrb- 21 jump street , x-files -rrb- , producer -lrb- black christmas , the others , milennium -rrb- and director -lrb- final destination 1 y 3 , the one , and x files episodes -rrb- , but his filmmaking in dragon ball is ridiculous and embarrassment . rating : below average .		3		0
identifying which installment of the halloween series ushered in the saga 's slide into abject idiocy is a no-brainer -lrb- yep , this is the one -rrb- , and you can also pinpoint the precise moment that irrecoverable shift occurs : roughly 40 minutes into the revenge of michael myers , when the boots of a mysterious man in black step off of a bus and onto the streets of haddonfield . even aside from the introduction of the subplot that ruined the michael myers mythos forever , halloween 5 takes hearty strides to be the worst entry in the franchise up to this point . the story makes virtually no sense , the logic that drives the key components of the plot ranges from flimsy to asinine , vital characters get killed off without anyone seeming to notice that they 're gone for the rest of the film , and the ineptness of haddonfield 's law enforcement is presented to us via `` send in the clowns '' circus music that inexplicably chimes in when they 're on camera . a brief exposition reveals how michael myers survived being riddled with buckshot at the end of the previous flick : he was nursed back to health by a man who lives in a shack by the river , and the shape was apparently somehow able to reside with this clueless samaritan for a full year without being discovered or arousing any suspicion from his house-mate . danielle harris reprises her role as michael 's traumatized niece jamie , but while she was a delightfully spunky young heroine in halloween 4 , she 's given very little to do here besides shriek and have seizures . after repeatedly stabbing her step-mom with a pair of scissors at the conclusion of part 4 -lrb- a savage act which all of the returning cast members are evidently totally cool with -rrb- jamie has been remanded to a children 's psychiatric care facility , where she 's in the hands of brilliant and capable doctors who see no problem with requiring a young girl who was stalked and nearly murdered by a deranged killer on halloween night to participate in a festive holiday costume pageant a mere year later . the impending anniversary sparks michael back into action , and he embarks on a mission to wipe out everyone who survived his last killing spree , and several more people who are simply around to be slaughtered -lrb- including a dude with a serious fonzie fixation -rrb- . meanwhile , jamie 's psychic link with her uncle allows her to `` see '' his nefarious deeds while they 're taking place , and she sets out to stop his reign of terror -lrb- strangely , the impetus for jamie 's intervention is the peril of her stepsister 's friend tina ; jamie 's actual stepsister is the first to die , and not only does this fail to spur jamie on , neither she nor anyone else in the film even mention rachel again until the very end of this wretched tale -rrb- . the action is driven by the requisite stabbings and you 'll be expecting , but the death scenes are so dully telegraphed that they have very little impact . when the film-makers attempt to integrate suspenseful elements , the results are generally pretty lame , such as the sequence where michael uses the fonzie wannabe 's car to pick up tina , who obtusely thinks our lovable killer is her boyfriend wearing a mask . the shape , having his would-be victim in his clutches and at his mercy , maximizes her vulnerability the way any sensible murderous psychopath would : he stops at a liquor store so she can go in and buy cigarettes , which allows her to get out of the car and promptly be rescued by the police . that same automobile also plays a pivotal role in perhaps the silliest scene in the film , in which michael chases jamie down ostensibly intending to run her over , but is somehow unable to get the souped-up muscle car going fast enough to match the speed of a panic-stricken nine year-old girl on foot . one of the saddest aspects of halloween 5 is how it renders dr. loomis a hysterical old coot who desperately needs to be put out to pasture . the doc 's climactic master-plan involves using jamie as bait to lure michael back to the abandoned myers house , at which point loomis essentially waves off a virtual army of policemen and swat troopers to face his nemesis all by himself . worse , his ploy to finish michael off involves soothingly counseling him and entreating him to let jamie `` make the rage go away . '' after hearing loomis expound about michael being the essence of pure evil and inhumanity for more than 10 years , this pop psychology tactic plays out as a resoundingly foolhardy approach . however , the most grievous crime against the series committed here arrives during the final exchange between jamie and the shape , which results in a close-up shot of a tear running down michael 's cheek . so essentially , according to halloween 5 , the emotionless embodiment of murderous fury we 've previously seen mow down a few dozen people in cold blood is actually a sensitive monster whose heart melts when someone calls him `` uncle . '' the coda features the true purpose of the man in black coming to light when the enigmatic figure uses a machine gun to single-handedly slaughter a building full of cops and busts michael out of jail . this cliff-hanger guaranteed another sequel would be forthcoming , but considering how awful this one was , that attempt at enticement resonates more like a threat than a promise . if you 're a fan of the series , any movie featuring michael myers is bound to offer at least a modicum of entertainment , and this entry certainly has a few moments that will keep you from ejecting the disc . but as a whole , revenge is an absolute train-wreck . halloween 5 may not be the worst movie ever made , but considering the unabashed disrespect it demonstrates toward the series that preceded it , it very well may be the most disappointing .		3		0
not in much of a rush , was he ? he must really like his brother . a lot . this is such a yawn of a film ! the first half is even watchable enough and can be survived without permanent brain damage if one has the necessary mental discipline , but the second half - and particularly the last half-hour - are so s l o w that i ca n't see how anyone can consider this to be anything else but a forgettable mediocrity . but because lynch made it the film predictably gets overpraised , as is the case with most of his post - `` elephant man '' movies . -lrb- it 's so very easy for critics to rate this yawner highly when they do n't have to sit through it ; they simply know who directed it and immediately have an opinion . -rrb- lynch basically directs the camera at the main character but nothing happens . if he 'd even picked his nose once it 'd have been an event ! this lack of activity is in the vast majority of the scenes , while soppy , cliché hollywood music doodles in the background - and this pathetic and highly unoriginal combination of and is supposed to make the viewer fall into uncontrollable weeping frenzies . the ending is particularly pathetic . this movie is a sleeping pill the size of arizona . this is n't even a chick flick : it 's a pensioners flick .		3		0
the movie has quite a few good actors at hand . and i do think that they 're trying their best . but i also do think that the movie is n't able to walk the thin line it set out to walk on . like it tries to be clever and you can feel it trying . and that 's not a good thing . a movie is either cool or it is n't . it 's also switching back and forth between action , dark humour , slapstick and thriller moments . unfortunately not that well mixed together . the movie is just not sure what it wants . another indication for that , are the alternate endings that were put on the disc . not that they do shine a new on things . i know quite a few people enjoyed this more than me , but i just could n't . so read a couple of other comments and then decide if you want to watch the movie		3		0
the remake is not for everyone . dracula 2000 does have an eerie side to it . but whatever is done is far overdone . the music is louder than the actors in some parts that i had to keep adjusting the volume on a six speaker surround sound . the acting is hilarious . very few actors demonstrate potential . colleen fitzpatrick -lrb- vitamin c -rrb- embarrasses herself . by far the plot is dumb . most vampire stories have a bit of intelligence to it . dracula 2000 has no brains to go with the fright . everything is corny . the sneer and silly one liners that dracula says do not sound of that of a 400 year old undead monster . would there not be some intelligence ? new remake of the dracula tale as robbers set out to steal fortune from van helsing . instead , they get a coffin and a death wish as dracula returns . dracula 's plans for revenge on helsing are put on hold once he senses his blood in another person in new orleans . luck be darned , it is also van helsing 's daughter that dracula is after . do not expect a gracious love story from dracula 2000 . the new ` twist ' on the birth of dracula and who he really is takes a hilarious new form . let us pray that this new take is the only one . the horror part to dracula is rock solid and well done . it is the film 's only saving grace . dracula 2000 is yet another joke of a movie with a numbing sound track and an equally pathetic story .		3		0
if you liked the ghost rider : spirit of vengeance . do n't read any further . if you want to know how i think spirit of vengeance destroyed a perfectly good franchise , read on . i do n't know if the ghost rider movies is true at all to the comic , and for me it does n't really matter . the movies must be able to stand alone , free of the comic , since a complete translation is never possible anyway . so when the sequel , spirit of vengeance , to ghost rider begins with not being true to the first movie it destroys its own foundation . if minor details is not carried over it does n't matter much , but spirit of vengeance has very little of ghost rider in it . and i must say i liked ghost rider . it was tongue in cheek action with a entertaining dialog , creating an air about it that i liked . spirit of vengeance has none of it . directly it shows a completely different way blaze struck his deal with the devil . why ? it certainly was n't better , as i liked how the devil tricked blaze with the deal in the first one . this has no real bearing upon the story , so why not use footage from the first film ? the only thing the change accomplishes is ruining the contract between movie and spectator . we now know that the movie does n't respect its own continuity . it does n't believe in its own story , so why should i ? actually , it is one of the quickest ways i have seen to kill interest in a sequel . kudos to the director/writers . other things they changed that destroys the spirit of the movie is ; blaze 's behavior is completely different . in the first one blaze was very troubled and tested the deal , in this one cage tries to act blaze as insane -lrb- and fails completely -rrb- , nervously laughing randomly . the rider 's weapons , motive and character is changed to a more insane monster than a real spirit of vengeance which implies that the character has some intent of accomplishing anything . here the rider just goes mayhem . and why change the penance stare -- that destroys the souls ? it was a weapon that made the rider unique , now he is changed to a walking flame thrower ? why not keep the implication that the rider is actually created by the devil to hunt souls instead of just being a fire monster ? the rider 's motorcycle is changed and i do n't see why it need be . it 's like changing iron man 's suit , it was part of his identity . but they have n't kept that either , so why bother . and peter fonda 's devil was much better , seemed much more devious , plotting and therefore evil than the simpleminded one ciaran hinds has to portray . on its own spirit of vengeance is a decent , but not good , action . the effects are good but the story is much more unbalanced and , believe it or not , more over the top . the idea seems to be bigger effects is better , let 's shoot missiles instead of bullets , let the rider handle mining equipment instead of his bike . but the story is forgotten and underdeveloped , it seems like a few mystic quasi-religious themes has been thrown together . it is the story that creates the entertainment , with the effects augmenting it . this is something the writers/director seems to have missed , since they have it the other way around . to sum up spirit of vengeance would be to way badly over the top . form effects to cage 's insane acting . the bright spot is idris elba as the monk moreau . though i missed sam elliott , moreau replaces the caretaker and elba does the best of it . there is an intriguing character , a motorcycle riding , weapon wielding alcoholic monk . why not explore and develop that character more ? unfortunately he is barely used in the movie . a decent writer could perhaps make an effort for a spin-off ? one review i read was that they attempted to reboot the franchise since they did n't like the first one -lrb- why not ? -rrb- . they failed , what they accomplished was destruction . 3/10		3		0
i gave this movie 3 stars out of ten in the imdb voting section and the only reason i rated it that high was because of the great beginning . and in the opening sequence , who do we have playing the role ? brad dourif as the gas station attendant . brad dourif is a horror veteran first of all -lrb- the voice of chucky -rrb- but further more he is a great actor -lrb- mississippi burning , one flew over the cuckoo 's nest -rrb- but what really makes the beginning work is not so much who is in it , but how it is directed . there is true terror in the beginning . there are false scares and then just when you think the person is safe , whammo , she gets it . that is what the rest of the movie is missing . there is no real suspense . and that is what made horror films so popular in the 70 's and 80 's . you can talk about classics like psycho and halloween but you can even go into mindless , quickie films like the prey , pieces , the forest and any other 80 's film that we saw as teens . they are really not that good , but what they did is they scared you . horror directors emulated what they knew from guys like polanski and carpenter . they had an icon to look up to and even if their films left quickly , at least they scared us as teens on video in the basement on a saturday night . this film is like every other recent film -lrb- with the exception of scream -rrb- that has tried to be a horror film . it just does n't get it right . there is no blurry image of the killer lurking ominously and imminently in the background . there is no fancy camera work to make you think the killer is coming from one way and then all of a sudden just when you have no idea what is going to happen , someone gets a machete in the head and they roll down a flight of steps . what we have here is a bunch of good looking actors that are killed off one by one in ways that really did n't scare me . they were actually laughable . and the other thing that really bothered me in the film is the identity of the killer . there is no way that person could accomplish some of the feats they did . they were not '' the undead '' like jason . they were not dream characters like freddy and they were n't as mentally unstable as michael . the idea behind this film makes for an intriguing story , it 's too bad that maybe sean cunningham or steve miner from the early 80 's could n't have done something with it . that would be a movie i would pay to see . but i do hope people keep trying to make the next great horror film , because it is a fun genre . it just has to be done right .		3		0
i quite like theme park thrill rides . most of the best rides condense the excitement into ten minutes , however watching this dramatised attraction for nearly three hours felt like being trapped on a interminably and that , even to a white-knuckle fan like me , is way too long . the plot is convoluted beyond belief , characters die , come back to life and then die yet again for barely credible reasons , leaving me confused as to what was and was n't real . the production strains for bigger and better effects as it goes , from a ship that moves on millions of crabs , to jack 's split , to calypso 's giantess metamorphosis , to the final ships ' battle on the edge of a raging maelstrom , they just numbingly keep coming at you , interspersed with lots of deliberately exaggerated ham acting and weak attempts at humour . the actors all have a great time , as you 'd expect although it 's odd that the likes of geoffrey rush , keira knightley and orlando bloom all seem to garner more screen-time than the headlining johnny depp although any reversal would n't have made much difference . rolling stone keith richards actually steals the show with his cameo , but of course he 's not acting wasted and decadent because he is already , all told , it just did n't work for me at all and i felt at the end like i 'd endured over two hours of being hit about the face by a wet fish .		3		0
from director terry gilliam -lrb- brazil , the fisher king , twelve monkeys -rrb- , at the time of release from the clips i had seen i could tell this was n't going to be anything that would get critics excited , i watched to see what i would think . basically the brothers grimm , wilhelm -lrb- matt damon -rrb- and jacob -lrb- heath ledger -rrb- , are a pair of cons who trick people into paying money to get rid of their fake ghosts or witches haunting them , and they travel around germany doing this . however when people believe that they really can get rid of these demons and monsters , they hire them to get rid of possibly real ones , only to be arrested for their crime of fraud by the french army , led by general delatombe -lrb- jonathan pryce -rrb- . he lets them go on the deal that they do rid the villagers of these strange occurrences , including young girls , one wearing a red riding hood , kidnapped and taken into the woods , and a brother and sister following a trail and disappearing . as time goes by , and joined by a female companion , they realise that these creatures are indeed real and create threat towards innocent people , but in the end of course they are defeated , and the wilhelm and jacob go on to write great fairy tales based on their experiences . also starring monica bellucci as mirror queen , lena headey as angelika , peter stormare as cavaldi , mackenzie crook as , richard ridings as , alena as red hooded girl , martin as hans and as greta . damon and ledger do alright with their english accents and good looks , you can recognise the moments from the real brothers ' most famous fairy tales , such as the frog prince , rapunzel , hansel and gretel , little red riding hood and sleeping beauty , and the special effects for the creatures and action seem fine , but that it is all you can say really , it is a pretty pointless and silly film otherwise , a disappointing period fantasy adventure . adequate !		3		0
the fourth `` dirty harry '' installment , and probably the worst one . actually , this must be one of clint eastwood 's worst films in general . in some of his other outings , like `` tightrope '' , eastwood seems to try out new things and to avoid presenting his characters as stereotypes . in this one , you get the feeling that he made the whole film just for the money . aside from being overlong , predictable and repellently violent , this film is also profoundly offensive . we are asked to identify with locke 's character , who is cold-bloodedly killing her rapists one-by-one , to approve of callahan 's methods and to laugh at the `` '' who disapprove of those methods . eastwood really goes over the line in this one , and the ending is particularly offensive .		3		0
`` the messenger '' -lrb- or `` joan of arc '' -rrb- is the kind of film that is difficult to form a solid opinion about . at least i felt that after watching it . it 's a very strange , quite unusual biographical epic , with many good things and some bad things . after a small explanation of the situation of france that time -lrb- the war with england for the french territory -rrb- , the film starts showing a pre-adolescent jeanne -lrb- or joan , as you wish -rrb- confessing in a church of her village . she claims that she has some visions in which a boy tells her what to do . some minutes after , in a field , she has one of those visions and , when she ` wakes up ' the english soldiers are destroying her village . she sees her sister being killed , then raped by a soldier , and after the funeral she goes to live with her uncles in another village . jeanne seems very shocked with everything , but continues having visions . some years pass , and charles vii , who is to become king , is told that a young woman who claims to have visions in which she sees god , is coming to see him in order to be a soldier of the french army . he seems a little confused with this , but the only way for him to become the king of france is to win the war against england , and for that he has to accept jeanne as a soldier . she her mission and faces the english soldiers . in the middle of all that , she continues having visions and things starts to get confusing and dangerous for her . the story is not so hard to follow as in other epic films -lrb- as `` elizabeth '' -rrb- , but the film is quite . the first one hour is very interesting , but then come the battle scenes and these are just tedious . they show many headless bodies , blood , but ca n't escape from being boring . it 's the worst part of the film and i felt tempted to leave the movies . however , the last 40 minutes are very beautiful . the ending is wonderful and lets us with many questions about who was joan of arc in fact and what her visions meant . the acting in `` the messenger '' is great , specially from the supporting actors . john malkovich , faye dunaway and dustin hoffman all give solid performances . and there 's milla jovovich . well , her acting is another thing on the film that is quite difficult to form an opinion about . she shows talent in the scenes of visions , but she can be annoying when she yells . overall she did a pretty decent job . `` the messenger '' has everything an epic should have : beautiful costumes , wonderful art-direction , good music , beautiful photography , etc. . luc besson 's directing is also efficient . but i still think it 's difficult to say what i really thought of the film . for now , i give it a nice 7/10 , because i was n't really disappointed , but of course it could have been much better .		3		0
pretty much boring movie is at all gripping is the on a true story this should be at least something courageous portraying one of the greatest conquerers of the world.but rather than being courageous this was quite ferrel never looked acting is terrible in this than inspiring , alexander -lrb- collin ferrel -rrb- hardly looked a shadow of jolie never looked the mother of kilmer also fails to deliver , looking very much shabby & over-pretentious . rest of the casting is fight scenes are good though specially the epic battle with fighting was quite this movie the effort should have been more on alexander 's battle campaigns but this was more of a drama at all you enjoy this film , truly if real alexander would have seen this he would have been ashamed .		3		0
i saw resident evil i and ii on dvd i would never pay big money to watch this mess . mostly i saw the second and third films for oded fehr . too bad they were stupid enough to kill him off . this movie is all action , stupid action and no plot . but that 's all you can expect from a video game and a model turned actress . too bad the writers refuse to give you anything or anybody to truly like in these movies . and of course they left it open ended . you do n't know whether the others got out of vegas to their final destination and of course alice swears she 'll be bad to finish off the board of bad guys who started the whole thing . well i wo n't be seeing resident evil iv unless they clone carlos . 3/10		3		0
why are seltzer and friedberg still allowed to make movies ? did n't anyone learn their lesson after `` meet the spartans , '' `` disaster movie , '' `` epic movie '' or `` superhero movie ? '' all these movies seriously bombed . just who is thinking , `` aw , let 's give these guys another chance to try and match the wit and style of mel brooks . '' everything these guys create is worst than a failure . none of their movie make any money . they have no idea how to write jokes much less a successful parody . `` vampire sucks '' is just a another major mistake in a long line of major mistakes . it 's full of pointless scenes and references , comedy black-outs , stupid signs , idiot characters and implausible situations in a script especially written to embarrass the actors . thankfully , the movie is cast with mostly unknowns ; young actors who might not see acting jobs ever again . everything they did wrong in every other movie they 've done ... including the world 's worst sara michelle gellar lookalike . bad jokes , jokes stretched thin , tasteless jokes , sophomoric jokes , bathroom humor ... they toss everything in except funny and intelligent , just like seth mcfarlane . it lacks the wit and satire of mel brooks , the style of `` airplane '' and the creativity of the `` the naked gun . '' the biggest problem is that the mere idea of trying to parody the `` twilight '' series is like trying to pin a murder conviction on the mafia , nothing sticks very well . the `` twilight '' films are their own universe with their own vampire rules and laws , and trying to make fun of it makes about as much sense as , dare i say it , allowing seltzer and friedberg to keep trying to write these tasteless movies . there 's maybe a few high points with diedrich bader 's quips along the way , david deluise making an impromptu black eye peas reference -lrb- which is quickly ruined when one character corrects him -rrb- and one ill-timed truck horn . thankfully , there is only one fart joke , but if you want a more superior vampire flick , go rent `` dracula : dead and loving it .

the film has a fine cast and there are some original touches . the american actors speak unaccented english , without as much as a nod to any alien phones , for instance , despite the late 18th-century french setting . and there may be snatches of rococo music but most of the score is electronically amplified rock with , at one point , a singer belting out the old frank sinatra standard , `` fools rush in . '' there are multiple close ups of lavish plates of exquisitely prepared and presented food . and minute examination of clothing , wigs , fabrics , jewelry , and period shoes -- especially shoes . -lrb- the hairdresser who dolls up kirsten dunst as marie antoinette is a fairy and is played for laughs . -rrb- miniature dogs . lots of miniature dogs slurping up charlotte russes or other desserts . okay -- decadence in abundance . it might have taken ten minutes . instead , that 's what the entire film seems to be about . you have to applaud the director 's intent to do something different , something original . the problem is that it does n't work . rip torn 's speech does n't sound too much out of place but most of the rest of the women sound like valley girls . and , boy , they gossip ! in extended scenes , they gossip ! they talk behind one another 's back about hair styles and personalities -- `` she 's so political . '' stuff you could find on myspace . it would n't take much in the way of rewriting to turn this story of self-indulgent aristos at versailles into a handful of high school kids in el . and it did n't need to be directed by sophia coppola . martha stewart could have phoned it in while under house arrest . i do n't know which audience this was aimed at , but i can recommend it for selected groups anyway . those youngsters who , in a recent poll , identified toronto as a city in italy , for example . or the fourteen percent of us who believe barack obama is a muslim . or that majority of high school seniors unable to place the american civil war in its correct half century . at least they 'd gain some familiarity with the dress of the period french court .		3		0
i am not a bond fan . i have watched most of the bond movies , and to me virtually all of them are silly and nonsensical to the point of the preposterous . sometimes they try to put some comedy and satire in there to make the lack of realism more endurable , but this rarely works . it consistently panders too much to the lowest common denominators . and it 's not because i 'm not a fan of far-out action movies - i am ! i happily watch a lot of schwarzenegger , stallone , seagal and jackie chan movies , and i thought mission impossible ii was a better bond movie than any bond movie . and hell , so was the bourne identity . but this new bond movie ? you know , i thought , from the almost uniformly good reviews and the obvious change in style , that casino royale might be different from the other bond movies . and it was : it was bad for a lot of different reasons . well , and a few of the same reasons , too . i admit it had acting . but it had absolutely no story . and it was * incredibly * dull . most of the action was not impressive , and the love story ended up not working . it would have worked if vesper lynd had been in earnest league with the bad guys . but she was n't . she was forced into it . so why does that constitute an immense betrayal that lays the foundation for bond 's `` disposable '' attitude to women ? nope , it does n't make a lick of sense . and this was the only thing in the movie with any chance of making sense , since we do n't know who the bad guys were and obviously are n't supposed to care . this is immensely bad writing . i left the theater with a feeling of having taken absolutely nothing worthwhile with me from it . even as `` empty entertainment '' , this movie had nothing to offer me , and it left me largely indifferent . note that in knocking this movie i 'm not knocking daniel craig . i always thought he 'd do a good job , and he did do a decent one . but he 's not charismatic enough to truly carry a movie as superficial as this , the way it badly needed to be held aloft . and as for mads mikkelsen , of whom , as a dane , i am naturally a huge fan ; his decent performance did little to sway me in this movie 's favor . he was intense in the torture scenes , but the poker scenes were themselves dangerously close to audience torture . and as for eva green - hate to say it , but she 's just not my type . she does n't do a thing for me . she 's kinda pretty , sure , and she can act , sure , but she 's not my idea of a good-looking woman . -lrb- she did resemble ursula andress - who 's not my type , either - a good deal , though . -rrb- she exudes a kind of aristocratic that i just have zero interest in . now , young jacqueline bisset as ms. in the 1967 movie - * she * was a sizzler ! anyway - another problem i have with the new casino royale was the drowning scene . was a disgustingly protracted death scene really necessary ? no , and it was , in my opinion , in damn poor taste . sorry , but my personal experience of watching this movie was that it was almost as dull as drying paint , and had less coherence . the only thing that was remotely well done was the acting and some of the characterization , and that 's not even enough for this movie to approach mediocrity . i am at a complete loss to understand why it garnered rave reviews from virtually all quarters . did the reviewers see a different movie than i did ? must have . to see here on imdb that half of everybody who watched this so far have rated it a 10 out of 10 is the closest i have ever come to suspecting really foul play with the ratings here . i have great difficulty believing that so many people found this movie so good . or maybe this movie is simply seen mostly by people who have no discerning bone in their body , and can only rate movies either a 1 or a 10 . barring a conspiracy , that has to be the explanation . 3 out of 10 .		3		0
... especially if it 's a remake ! and this time or better in this case , the remake might look good -lrb- even on paper , with two heavyweights in the front line - chow yun fat and jodie foster , and some bit players behind them , bai ling and so forth -rrb- , but it 's what inside that counts . and there it lacks ... it lacks the heart and the purity of the original with yul brunner as a much better `` king '' -lrb- with more edges than yun fat -rrb- . the original had another flavor , it played around another time and it worked . although jodie is an excellent actress , you just do n't buy into her . and you especially do n't buy into the `` relationship '' between her and the king ... etcetera etcetera etcetera ! -lrb- had to do that at least one time , for sake -rrb- . so if you want to listen to me , go watch the original instead of this one -lrb- yes the original is a musical , but even i liked it and i 'm not that into musicals ! -rrb-		3		0
once in a lifetime a movie series like alien comes along with a great story , intense action , great acting etc. . and also , someone always seems to get their filthy little , greedy paws on them after they are completed and have basked in their glory . this is one of those movies . possible spoilers , but the movie will ruin itself ... alien : regurgitation is a complete fraud of the alien franchise . it does n't fit with the rest of the films and puts a black mark on a wonderful series of movies . even though alien 3 was questionable and not nearly the same caliber as the first two , it completely blows away this turd . i think one of the many wonders of the world for me is why weaver even read this script , much less decided to accept it . shameful . i wo n't even give a plot summary for this crap . the plot is weak , and the action looks like john `` ca n't make a decent movie '' woo directed it . not only that , what the hell is up with the alien with a sad/happy face ?! i mean , what in the hell ?! not only that , they could n't even come up with a better way to kill it off ... they did they exact same thing as they did in the first two movies !!! lame . movies like this make me hate hollywood and it 's unquenchable thirst for money . for me , this movie does not exist in the alien series and will be the reason why i will never buy the quadrilogy ... i 'd be embarrassed to have this movie in my collection . weak , bloated , unnecessary , and completely gay . 5/10 . < -- it would 've been lower without the aliens in it . it also would 've been lower had i written this before voting ... blast ! do not expect anything of this movie except to see aliens .		3		0
1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen . christine , the dead zone and cujo were all released within a few months of each other . while the dead zone was easily the pick of the bunch , christine and cujo were both pretty bad , and it 's a thing as to which is the lesser of the two . if pushed for an answer i 'd say cujo - marginally - is the weakest . donna trenton -lrb- dee wallace , fresh from success as elliot 's mom in `` e.t - the extra terrestrial '' -rrb- is a mother whose marriage to husband vic -lrb- daniel hugh-kelly -rrb- is hanging by a thread . she 's been having an affair with a local worker , and is now dwelling on whether or not to leave her husband . dragged into the marital heartache is young tad trenton -lrb- danny pintauro -rrb- , son of donna and vic , and a pretty messed-up kid with a chronic phobia of the dark which often leads to severe panic attacks . donna and tad take the family car to a nearby mechanics ' yard for repairs , but as they arrive their car splutters to a halt . things get a heck of a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic , joe camber -lrb- ed lauter -rrb- , is n't there -lrb- he has been savagely killed by his pet dog cujo , a gigantic st. bernard which was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat . -rrb- soon , the dog has them trapped in their car and is trying everything to get inside the vehicle to tear apart these two hapless victims . the weather is hot ; not a living soul knows they 're there ; the car wo n't start ; and the dog seriously wants their blood ... . cujo has potential to be a genuinely taut siege thriller , but it never really clicks into gear . i 've read the book and it is quite disappointing - certainly for king - so it 's hardly surprising that the film version amounts to so little . on the printed page , king was at least able to generate a degree of tension , but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a st. bernard simply is n't very scary . the `` '' of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that cujo is a st. bernard . in the book , it was possible to forget this . in the book , cujo sometimes almost seemed to assume the guise of a monster . even with the relatively short running-time of an hour-and-a-half , cujo becomes a tedious and experience , occasionally unintentionally funny and certainly never as suspenseful as it would like to be . they 've even omitted the book 's cruelly downbeat ending and replaced it with an `` all 's well that ends well '' conclusion so that audiences can go home in a cheerful mood !!! chalk this one down as yet another inferior king adaptation .		3		0
five years has passed since the last movie , laurie strode -lrb- jamie lee curtis -rrb- has been institutionalized after killing the wrong man whom she thought was her brother . michael myers however is still on the rampage as he confronts with her for the very last time , however back in haddonfield a producer named freddie harris -lrb- busta rhymes -rrb- and girlfriend -lrb- tyra banks -rrb- hire some college students -lrb- sean patrick thomas , thomas ian nicholas , bill kay , bianca kajlich , ryan , katee sackhoff , luke kirby daisy -rrb- to do a reality program on the net called dangertainment . they wire cameras in the myers home to do their program which could be very successful , unfortunately michael is back as he terrorizes the reality crew . the worst movie of the series ! some people say it 's `` halloween iii : season of the witch '' but no it 's not , that movie which maybe unrelated was an experiment to turn the franchise into a big screen horror anthology . some say it 's `` halloween : the curse of michael myers '' but that maybe bad but it had it 's moments , now `` resurrection '' is truly the worst and most embarrassing movie in the series . i do like the idea of a `` survivor '' - esque reality show on the internet within the myers house idea but the idea seem to got wasted by the bad acting , some miscasting , some lame killing sequences and a stupid fight sequence with busta rhymes kicking myers 's butt as he quotes `` trick or treat motherf ***** '' . rock rosenthal who gave us the superb `` halloween 2 '' did a poor job of bringing back michael to the screen as this movie nearly cripples the franchise no thanks to this dud .		3		0
it 's amazing to realize how much the rom-com genre has evolved over the last 10 or 15 years . compare while you were sleeping , for instance , with must like dogs . while still hewing to the traditional rom-com plot arc , the latter has subtlety , wit , depth , and a delicate touch . while you were sleeping does not . everything about this movie is predictable , including bullock 's performance . it 's interesting to see the earlier work of someone who 's been in the business for over 15 years . in her case -lrb- as is the case with the bewilderingly overrated julia roberts -rrb- , bullock seems to have developed a set of pat reactions early on and not strayed too far from them . the only redeeming feature of this picture is that it 's not * completely * insulting to our intelligence . plus there are some believable , though stock , performances by supporting players . other than that , it has nothing to offer .		3		0
i 'd like to put full blame on frank darabont for the rubbish i saw , but equal blame should go to stephen king . this is the dumbest story i think he 's ever created . sci-fi is not his cup of tea . after i saw dreamcatcher , i thought that was bad . the mist makes it look award worthy . this film is to horror/sci-fi what the stone temple pilots were to grunge music . the story pilfers from so many of its predecessors , including the mummy , of the living dead , aliens , you name it . praise for this film is misleading . if it is fun you are looking for , stay away from the mist . like all king stories , this one is set in a town in maine . it begins in the living room of david drayton a painter of movie artwork . it is a dark and stormy night , stormy enough to uproot a tree which crashes through the window . the next morning , after he and his wife inspect the damage and decide what to do , david goes grocery shopping at the local supermarket , taking his son with him . as it turns out , everybody at there is talking about the storm , and the damage it has done . but that is only a wrist slap compared to the disaster which is about to follow . all of a sudden , a strange mist engulfs the mall , and in runs a local with blood on his clothes . shaken and panicking , he claims that there is something in the mist , and it has killed someone . the doors are shut and locked in a futile attempt to keep the unknown out . what follows is a boring series of creature attacks causing everyone to , panic , argue , and point fingers at each other . david -lrb- eager to get his son to safety -rrb- must find a solution , before it is too late . the whole movie is a gimmick : badly written , badly acted , unscary , and even incompetent with visual effects . actually , the biggest problem i have with the mist can be summarized in one word ... subversive . the mist has themes which are perfectly fine , but the film takes it too far over the top , which interferes with good story telling . representing religion is harden , whose performance is the worst of the year . thomas jane in the lead role is n't so good either . jane is the wrong actor for an emotional character like a struggling father . he works better as your basic all american hero , which he was in deep blue sea . it is kind of hard to figure out why people praise this movie . what i saw was disappointing and is not something i recommend to fans .		3		0
director taylor hackford 's crackpot boot camp melodrama takes place in the present day , but it has all the musty clichés you 'd expect from such a scenario -lrb- hackford really is a hack ; he does n't even try to revitalize the clichés , he merely disguises them with new-fangled handling , bad language and sex included -rrb- . richard gere manages to escape his rough-hewn , hard-partying father by enlisting in navy flight school , but his drill sergeant appears to hate him on sight . oscar-winner louis gossett , jr. plays the sneering , appalled gunnery sergeant with absolutely no let-up , and with no regard to all the impersonations of this same character from past history -lrb- he 's yet another cliché , who naturally uses the old `` are you a man ? '' line -- only here it becomes `` steers and queers '' -rrb- . debra winger has a threadbare role as a who only wants to land an officer , but she 's merely around to make gere momentarily swoon . the real love story , per se , lies in the masochistic one between the stubborn recruit and the sergeant who wants to break him . it 's a stale throwback without much humor or heart , only sweat . * 1/2 from ****		3		0

boxing day . 2004 . after an underwater earthquake a tsunami hits the shores of east asia . a family of five maria -lrb- naomi watts -rrb- , henry -lrb- ewan mcgregor -rrb- and their three kids : lucas -lrb- tom holland -rrb- , thomas -lrb- samuel joslin -rrb- and simon -lrb- oaklee pendergast -rrb- are blissfully spending time on the shores of a thai luxury hotel . unexpectedly the wave hits them unawares while having fun in the pool . soon the family is torn apart with maria and lucas swept away and henry holding the two youngest sons disappearing in the undertow . juan antonio bayona delivers a spectacular recreation of the tsunami with its destructive currents leaving a destitute landscape in its wake . given this ordeal and its scale it seems obvious that when the water settles the ensuing drama of dealing with the aftermath will take over . at first we follow maria and lucas , who stick together even with the risk of life , thankfully manage to come out alive , holding each other in embrace . grateful at least to have each other , and as they fully realise the miracle of surviving the incident the obvious dawns on them - the inevitability that the remainder of the family is most probably dead . naturally anyone privy to seeing a trailer or even knowledgeable that killing the only recognisable star -lrb- apart from watts -rrb- five minutes into the movie is highly unlikely knows that henry is bound to reappear . couple that together with the title `` impossible '' and soon the obviousness is obvious : the whole family will impossibly survive . thus making the whole rabbit run around the devastation in search of family members a prolonged path to the inevitable conclusion , which makes the tidal wave seem nothing more than a minor time-consuming inconvenience . unfortunately this search for family constitutes the remainder of the story , albeit it also offers sights of chaos and scenes or glimpses of families not as lucky . the whole plodding certainty as to the finale is finally put to ridicule during a comedic runaround at a thai hospital with family members ` just missing each other ' for five or so minutes , which - despite the sombre music - invoked some badly placed laughter . `` impossible '' proved somewhat of a conundrum . the whole event itself is so dramatic , that it is hard to denigrate a heart-warming story connected to it . but the shock factor and then layered sentimentality on offer by bayona is just so overwhelming , that i never really felt for any of the main characters , even more so that the conclusion was apparent once the waves rescinded . given how emotional the premise , i found myself astounded that i just did n't empathise despite bayona 's obvious attempt to milk the audience -lrb- and i am easy person to jerk a few tears out of -rrb- . but maybe that was the problem ? the manipulation of tear glands is just too forced . all in all a bloated cutesy waste of a spectacularly well made catastrophe with an overbearing message : that in such a deadly calamity it 's good to be rich and white ... as soon as the family reunites they are whisked off in an empty private jet to the safety of first class hospital care . shame the movie did n't end immediately after the tsunami ...		3		0
i am not the ideal audience for a movie like this . i 've grown very tired of movies written backwards from the big and this is one of the very . the only one i think was any good was `` the others , '' whose surprise ending did n't cheapen every frame of the movie that came before it . i am not a fan of john cusack , whose appeal escapes me . but i was intrigued that he would take a role like this in a movie like this . but it 's really only interesting enough to be a short tv movie . hopefully this movie is the caboose on the surprise-ending movie train . i do n't hate it , i just do n't think it 's worth your time . i do n't think it 's a sleeper that will gain in reputation . it 'll just be forgotten .		3		0
one of the scenes has kevin 's character accosting the mayor of a to revoke the legislation that barred dancing and any form of that incensed `` sexual tension '' among teenagers . with palpably weird contortions to his mouth , he looked as if he would decorate the room with the most vibrantly colorful he could be compared to a frog , constantly puffing his mouth as if cursed by ron weasley 's cracked wand ! the enigma remains unsolved . it would be too abstruse to figure out . i could n't empathize with bacon 's character at all . his elusive behavior - a stroke of genius or simply amateurish writing and acting ? i incline towards the latter . in the beginning , he looks like a new kid on the block , shy , taciturn . then he plays loud music and is apprehended by the police . every factor in town sort of his obscure passion for dancing , his happiness and acceptance into the society - like karate kid sans much sense . his so-called penchant towards dancing was impertinent - the director perhaps could n't find any good choreographers and this hampered the whole movie . it more felt like a musical , except for an instance where kevin around the factory like `` welder tarzan '' ! that makes it a sports movie . kevin is too young and inexperienced to tackle this fairly challenging performance . he could n't emote well at all - courtesy the daffy script which seemed like excerpts picked from various other cheesy movies that were a vogue in the 80 's . the 80s in hollywood was the beginning of a renaissance - as it gave birth to modern , crass and impetuous ` rebels ' or ` iconoclasts ' . but it was just the salad days , where little cubs pretended to mime lions and puppies yelped at in leashes . it was a bit embarrassing - the barbaric , uncouth of a hair -lrb- seriously , how much hair can a human bear ! -rrb- , fizzed out jokes interspersed with expletives just to sound cool -lrb- saturday night fever -rrb- , appearing buffoonish in front of equally ludicrous looking peers , -lrb- and lots of it -rrb- , established principles of the society , no matter how moral or otherwise , and the most part is the tight-fitting , trousers worn by both sexes that could suffocate a human body . people in that town are hypocrites for sure - they disallow convivial celebrations and merriment while they have no worries about girls accentuating their figures in tight-fitting jeans . does n't that galvanize the lubricious hormones of guys into action ? the writer had imposed so many restrictions , so why not just add another one that forced girls to wear frocks . they could have touched that silly issue too . i can not comment much on the performances since they were too scarce in the film , which is a great worry since its based on dance . even million dollar baby , that took a dramatic shift in the second half at least had a balance of both elements . i could hear lot of sweet cadence though . `` holding out for a hero '' is my personal favorite . anyway , shifting back to kevin , i feel that he should have worked more on his facial expressions and confidence . its not about getting expressive to an overtly theatrical extent , but more of conviction with a pinch of theatricality . rubbing the hair frequently , biting teeth , picking nose often etc are habits imbibed by many from childhood . even repetitive hand gestures in a similar manner - all add to a sense of naturalism . or , if he did want to keep it simple , an endearing performance would have been enough . sadly , he does n't have both . the is fine though as the self-denying pedant who is antagonized by the young blood . two short confrontations , one to bury the hatchet , between kevin and him , were n't enough since they follow different ideologies and should have discussed more about their views with one other . the daughter , also kevin 's love interest , endeavors but sort of falters in her role , even though she 's better than bacon . and her suicidal tendencies were covered in a tacky manner . none of the others are worth a mention . sarah is fine -lrb- and by fine , i mean compared to others in the movie -rrb- , kevin 's best friend is unintentionally funny . the worst part was the short brawl between him and the old man and the focus on sarah and him for about five minutes sitting and watching others dance . it was tedious . another problem was the pacing . the movie is laborious mostly , only mildly -lrb- and embarrassingly -rrb- entertaining in some sequences . the story is downright silly and unnecessarily convoluted . the director took too much into his hands like a bartender trying to juggle starts to sing and dance along and falls flat in all . my verdict performance : 4/10 story : 2/10 direction : 3.5 / 10 music / choreography :5 / 10 overall : 3/10		3		0
so ! what 's all the fuss about ? i was very disappointed with this highly touted offering from director sam mendes and writer alan ball . to be fair , the film does focus well on some of our worst human frailties , and a few scenes are disturbingly close to home . having said this , i find it hard to call the disintegration of the family unit entertainment , let alone black comedy . i am a huge kevin spacey fan , yet i could not take to him in this film . either the role and he were mismatched , or he is only at his best in support roles . annette bening is at her marvellous best as the obsessive carolyn , and thora birch is a major talent on the threshold as the frustrated teenager jane . mena suvari , wes bentley , chris cooper , peter gallagher , sam robards and scott bakula also star . thomas newman produces a familiar theme . what a shame this film lost the plot so badly after a promising , thematic beginning . friday , january 28 , 2000 - village century city walk		3		0
in 1989 you knew rick moranis was going to be in one of the top movies of the summer , but most would probably have said that it was going to be ghostbusters 2 . well they were wrong it was this rather bad adventure movie for the kids . that is n't entirely fair for me to say , it just did not work for me , but other kids may like it . i was also 14 or 15 when i saw it so i just did not enjoy this family film . first of all it came with a really bad roger rabbit short . this was when they were still trying to make him into something , but that ended thankfully . after that we are treated to a rather unfunny comedy adventure about an inventor who develops the most useless of inventions ... the shrink ray . well i guess it does have some uses . well suffice to say rick moranis is the only person in the movie that got off a few lines i chuckled too , but other than that this movie is a pretty standard shrink movie . reminded me of the old tv show `` land of the giants '' i think it was called . the kids end up outside thanks to some house cleaning and there is where some stupid things occur such as befriending of an ant and the deadly scorpion ... an insect that is n't all that common in the back yard of most homes unless this movie took place in arizona or somewhere else west . there is also a bee ride and this makes up all the insects in the entire yard . just not very realistic and i am pretty sure you ca n't befriend an ant . like i said , i really did not care for this one , but it might be good for younger children so do n't totally dismiss it .		3		0
`` hi , my name is jeremy sisto , and i 'm from the census bureau . in other words , i 've come to count you hillbillies . i hear that you have inhabitants and one lame white metal rapper . '' `` that 's correct . we keep fred here because metal fans from all over the world had donated 15 million dollars to us to keep him here against his will . besides , he is so inexpensive and low maintenance : fred is the only one who wo n't be needing a lobotomy . '' `` the stepford wives '' . `` the reaping '' ... ... ... you do n't have a clue yet ? need more hints ? `` dead & buried '' . `` the wicker man '' ... ... ... still confused ? well , then this is the ideal movie for you ! if you still have n't guessed the type of horror sub-genre from these four hints , then you 've either never seen a horror film before , or you 're 9 years old and have never seen a horror film before . however , to figure out not only the genre but even the entire `` mystery '' behind this unoriginal premise , all you need to do is to watch the first 436 seconds of : contained in it is all the most basic information you need to spoil for yourself any kind of major plot-twist `` surprise '' that the incompetent writer and clumsy female director had planned for you . the movie begins like this : 1 . a man gets killed trying to run away from fred durst . -lrb- anyone anyone would run away from fred durst and his music , cop or no cop . -rrb- 2 . a baby is born at the same moment of the man 's death . 3 . the town 's plaque says `` population 436 '' . 4 . even the movie title tells you this . that is what is known as `` information overkill '' . hence , a simple mathematical equation should help even slipknot fans to read the humongous plot-twist miles ahead : 1 + 2 + = the town must be some kind of a religious cult that maintains its precise population number by force . so why watch the rest of the movie ? in the hope that fred durst 's character gets killed ? not only does freddy not get killed -lrb- horror-movie are immortal , remember ? -rrb- , but he even ends up getting engaged to sisto 's rather sexy -lrb- and recently lobotomized -rrb- girlfriend . you might wonder why she 's been lobotomized ... in order to agree to marry durst . duh ! so obvious . the movie 's painful predictability makes it even harder to watch because the cliché story moves very slowly . watching is like watching a snail trying to `` run '' away from a limp bizkit concert . nevertheless , because i 'm the type of person who sees the glass as half-full , i 'd decided not to get annoyed by the obvious flaws . instead of being peeved that fred durst now even infests the world of film -lrb- which is pitiful enough without him -rrb- , i chose to rejoice the fact that he does n't sing at all ! there is n't even a single limp bizkit track in the end-credits . well ... almost . in the barn scene -lrb- at the end -rrb- , when he threatens to kill himself but sadly does n't , he whines almost like he sings in lb . it 's quite funny , actually ... the definitive highlight of the film , as ironic as that may sound . and what modern-day horror film would be complete without the obligatory `` hey , my mobile phone does n't work here ! '' cliché ... iq		3		0
graphic and gross ; super slow and ridiculous ! teeth could 've been executed so much better given its propensity for amazing shock value but its mythological roots was married too clumsily with modern-day black humor . writer/director mitchell lichtenstein should 've learned a thing or two from someone who has perfected this combo , joss whedon . dawn -lrb- jess weixler -rrb- is an abstinence advocate who is privately torn with battling her own awakening teenage desires . it does n't help that her home situation is crazy : despite having the quintessential loving parents , her stepbrother brad -lrb- john hensley from nip/tuck -rrb- is the complete opposite . and , yes , discovering that her vagina has teeth . the exposition is slow ; the plot is super thin ; really painful to watch till the end . my curiosity got the better of me ; i also wanted to believe it can redeem itself in the end but teeth tanked very early on . super creepy old guy at the last scene is particularly disturbing .		3		0
contrary to the generally positive reviews this film has been receiving , i found this to be an awful film . from the perspective of retaining a strong correlation to the authenticity of the harry potter books , this film is perhaps a triumph . however , what it succeeds in from that perspective it totally misses in the sheer boredom the more than two hours of screen time it occupied . harry potter and the half-blood prince was not only exceedingly tedious , it was shoddy . the acting was awfully contrived for the most part , scenes were inane and the general impression from the audience was hardly appreciation for an entertaining evening out . i fail to see how children of any age , let alone adults , may find this subject matter exciting . harry potter 6 may well have sounded the for the series . a word of advice , read the books because the movie simply fails hopelessly to impress - perhaps as a sedative - nothing more .		3		0
ever since 1899 the maid of orléans has been the subject of all kinds of films , most of which are hazardous incursions into make-believe , but only a couple of which have been more or less historical attempts at being accurate . this film ventures into the blown-up so beloved by us audiences , and ends up being an unpalatable `` action flick '' with lots of effects and lots of stunts and lots of blood , ms jovovich destroying medieval english armies single-handed . luc besson should have known better ; next time he should try it with an cast and film it in the beatiful valley of the river loire , and adhere more strictly to historical facts easily available in any parisian archive . forget this rowdy commercialised nonsense , and try another version made the same year : joan of arc -lrb- -rrb- -lrb- tv -rrb- ... aka jeanne d'arc -lrb- -rrb- -lrb- tv -rrb- -lrb- canada : french title -rrb- with leelee sobieski and jacqueline bisset helped along by - unbelievably - peter o'toole and shirley maclaine , in a much more and historically version .		3		0

`` hola ! manuela velasco and i am a tv reporter with rabbit teeth . but do n't worry , those wo n't bite - or at least not nearly as hard as the amateur actors who will be playing zombies in a building that i 'm about to enter with pablo , my loyal cameraman . pablo has no rabbit teeth , and he does n't bite anyone in this movie , but he does have a silly habit of recording everything , even when his life is in immediate danger . is n't that silly ? '' apparently , most people are not only very easily made to laugh -lrb- `` the cosby show '' , `` friends '' -rrb- but also very easily scared by cheap-looking zombie films . how else to explain the ridiculous 7.8 average this movie got ? rec made me laugh in quite a few instances , but was n't supposed to . it is just another zombie film , and my best guess would be that only people who 've merely seen a handful of horror films -lrb- or less -rrb- in their entire lives could possibly have sweated bullets during this rather average movie that lacks atmosphere . there is something goofy about a horror film which is shot on video - for supposed `` realistic effect '' . here 's the problem with that : the fantasy horror genre , as opposed to the thriller horror genre , always struggles in suspending the viewer 's disbelief . hence , in order to make us believe that the supernatural proceedings are real , the visual quality , the make-up and the soundtrack have to be spot-on , otherwise the carnage comes off as a joke , eliciting laughs rather than fright . watching rec , it was close to impossible for me to get into the movie , mainly due to its utterly cheap video-camera visual quality . no , it does n't make the zombies look more realistic , it makes them look foolish . this is the kind of shoddy , uninvolving , flat picture quality you get when you watch your neighbours ' home-made movie about their latest garden barbecue party . the filmmakers , for some strange reason , decided to try and be original by giving the viewer the entire movie through the lens of a tv cameraman and his , blond spanish interviewer . as a result , the film had to look tv-like . however , this is neither particularly original nor effective . it is mostly annoying , what with all the like in a pitiful lars von trier movie . the only two times it became an asset was when pablo secretly filmed the injured zombies being treated and handcuffed , and in the last scene which showed a locked-up killing off the last two survivors . the ending was the closest the movie got to looking truly eerie , but by then it was too late . naturally , you only need two brain cells to predict with ease that the last two survivors will be the cameraman and manuela . ! otherwise the movie would end prematurely -lrb- which would n't have been a bad thing -rrb- . it made little sense that the first infected humans took an hour or longer to start their rampage , whereas the last infected building inhabitants turned to zombies almost immediately . how does that logic work ? who knows , maybe i 'm jaded , having seen dozens of zombie films . or maybe this mediocrity truly has little to offer apart from a woman with rabbit teeth barking orders at her cameraman , and a couple of unconvincing actors covered with blood going `` ! '' . still , unlike `` blair witch '' , rec at least has a plot and a conclusion - as primitive as both may be . press `` yes '' below if you want to see rec 2 .		3		0
the informant ! has an exclamation point after the title for a good reason - it suggests that even the writers and actors as well as the usually superb steven soderbergh had a tough time figuring out how to make this story into an entertaining while quite implausible movie . though based on a true story the movie is basically a running monologue by the hyperkinetic matt damon in a role that suits him not at all . at moments it seems like an outrageous comedy , then at others it appears as yet another appalling exposé of how big business and big politics intertwine to the detriment of our environment and moral deterioration . no one seems to know how to treat this piece , and maybe that is just as well . keep the exclamation point after the title - that sort of tells it all . side step this film if you are a fan of soderbergh or matt damon . grady harp		3		0
after blazing through a fusillade of comparatively igneous stunts in `` ghost rider '' , the flaming motorcyclist grovels back in `` ghost rider : spirit of vengeance '' with an extinguished storyline and spiritless confrontations that defuse the spark of interest ignited by the first installment . the clashes witnessed in this continuation culminate in lifeless chain lashes that obliterate enemies into bright ashes within a few seconds after they have been spawned on screen . the final showdown displays a more creative approach to the vapid fighting sequences initiated erstwhile but unfortunately into an all too ephemeral explosion given away prematurely in one of the trailers . additionally , the comical flare that attempts to shine brighter than the dim glint of action sequences is quickly burnt out with nicolas cage 's rather acerbically torched jokes . overall , `` ghost rider : spirit of vengeance '' the quality potential it lit previously with tediously charred cg craftsmanship , action scenes and humor .		3		0
as a sequel to a remake it was a bad idea . have one character as the sister of one the original survivors go back to the house to try to put her spirit to rest . i loved seeing stephen pacey on the screen again , i have n't seen him since he was in blakes 7 . the sets are all retained from the remake version but their mainly exploring parts of the house that had n't been seen in the remake . all the characters play their roles well enough and it 's pretty obvious whose going to die at the start of the movie , it 's just a matter of when and how .		3		0
after years of hearing this film praised to the skies , i finally got to see this last night , thanks to our buddies at tcm . for the benefit of you budding actors , the following is a blow-by-blow account of maria falconetti 's portrayal of joan of arc , considered by many critics to be the greatest performance in the history of film : goes into mode . then cries . goes into i 'm - mode . then cries . goes into zombie mode . then cries . goes into bobbing head doll mode . then cries . repeats modes like a broken record . then cries . a lot . joan of arc was a female george patton , someone who knew how to kick ass and take names . falconetti 's joan is a blubbering wack job no one would follow into a pillow fight ! oddly , the only time falconetti stops the blubbering wack job bit is when joan is about to be burnt to a crisp . the ending is a stupefying orgy of violence and bizarre camera angles . there is even a shot of a baby nursing , complete with full-frontal boobie ! and the guy in the mountie get-up lording over joan 's execution is a hoot ! where i can score some of that crack carl theodor dreyer was smoking ?		3		0
percy jackson and the olympians : the lightning thief -lrb- , pg -rrb- -- fantasy : supernatural , 2nd string , formula stop me if you 've heard this before . early adolescent -- gawky , bullied at school , crummy stepparent at home , self-esteem -- discovers from wise old mentor that he 's covertly descended from greatness , possessed of amazing hidden powers , and faced with a formidable challenge on which hangs the fate of the world . armed with only a cryptic clue or 2 , a conveniently provided artifact , a few trusted comrades , and moral determination , he sets out on a great quest . there 's a reason that this scenario has become a formula , captivating audiences over the centuries with real-life accomplishments of alexander the great , genghis khan , and jim bowie ; legends like hercules , perseus , and king arthur ; and fictional heroes like frodo baggins , the pevensie children , lyra , and harry potter . the reason is that it can make for a crackerjack story in which you , the reader -lrb- or viewer -rrb- , can readily identify with the hero and thrill along to his adventures . but the formula alone does n't do the job . philip pullman 's his dark materials trilogy is a terrific story , and the movie version of the golden compass -lrb- volume 1 -rrb- was well done -lrb- an 8 rating from me -rrb- , but it cost a ton of money to make , and it did n't grip the audience enuf to generate the word of mouth needed to recoup the investment ; thus no films of volumes 2 and 3 , alas ! so director chris columbus and the producers in the 5 companies behind today 's flick wanted to avoid the same mistake with the lightning thief , volume 1 in rick riordan 's 5 - book series percy jackson and the olympians . and they got one part right : the film looks really cheap . now , i 'm normally pleased to see a hollywood production willing to rely on traditional crafts like costuming , set design , makeup , and stunts , and not so much on all the cgi , but whatever route you take , you still have to do it well , and this just looks shoddy . the greek god poseidon has built a summer home for his estranged son percy , but evidently it would have stretched his too far to provide it with , y ' know , walls ! camp half blood * is where demigod teens ** hang out and apparently do nothing all day but play macedonian war games ; it 's a bunch of shacks in the woods . medusa lurks in a tawdry back - roads gift shop filled with life-sized -lrb- but not life-like -rrb- gray `` statues '' . even the hall of the gods on mount olympus looks as if somebody gussied up the main banquet room at a ramada inn . many aspects of the story are ludicrous : `` we are forbidden from stealing each others ' powers ! '' , poseidon remarks . `` but our children are n't . '' zeus retorts . well , says who ? turns out that it was zeus himself who laid down this particular `` law '' , complete with loophole , but then he 's puzzled that it did n't work out as he expected . upon arriving at camp half blood , percy -lrb- logan lerman -rrb- is immediately thrown into mock battle with what appear to be real swords and armor . he is n't a jock and he 's completely untrained , which should amount to a death sentence , but he manages to defeat his opponent annabeth -lrb- alexandra daddario -rrb- , of athena -lrb- no dad mentioned -rrb- , who has a hundred prior victories under her belt . percy stuffs his backpack with spare socks and sets out for the underworld to confront hades . new buddy annabeth and old buddy grover the satyr -lrb- brandon t. jackson -rrb- insist on coming along . one of them asks `` how do we get to the underworld ? '' . `` did not think of that ! '' our hero replies . no duh ! you see , percy 's suspected of stealing zeus 's thunderbolt , the loss of which will cause the heavens to explode with warfare if he does n't return it by the stroke of midnight on the upcoming summer solstice . to the surprise of no one , he does find it and arrives in the nick of time to find ... what ? massive preparations for celestial armageddon ? nope . all the prospective combatants are standing around in full mode . good acting , believable sets , and realistic dialog might have helped , but we get a lot of slack-jawed , wide-eyed gawking ; bad design ; and way , way too much use of the salutation `` guys '' . saving this production from the bottom of the barrel are a host of really imaginative adaptations of greek mythology , for which i presume we may thank the literary creator , mr. riordan . it 's about all the movie 's got going for it . -lrb- well , that and rosario dawson as a lascivious persephone . -rrb- if the lightning thief rewards frugality by making back its production costs , we 'll probably see a sequel . another cheap sequel . sigh . -- -- -- -- -- * no , no ripped-off title there , no , not us ! ** demigods are offspring of mortals and the greek gods ; the latter are supposedly the only true deities , and they appear to have been extraordinarily horny about years ago .		3		0
wes craven had in image in 1984 , he created a universe where a deceased child murderer fred krueger , tortures the children of the parents that killed him after he was let off his trial . krueger wears a dirty green and red sweater and wears a glove with knives on his fingers on his right hand . the catch to the original fantasy horror phenomenon was that if freddy killed the children in their dreams , they died in real life . over the years there were many sequels , 8 to be exact -lrb- if you include freddy vs jason -rrb- . but if i had to say , this and freddy 's dead : the final nightmare are the worst of the eight . if wes craven knew what this series would become , he might not have even made nightmare on elm street . maybe he made a new nightmare just to save it . this movie is just so dull , the dream scenes are weird as hell , sometimes you do n't even know if someone is dreaming or not , that 's how crazy weird this movie is . and in one scene this girl just walked into a dream . like she was walking , and then she was in a dream . what 'd she fall or some sh * t ? who knows . what i did find interesting was freddy , not on screen , but when the kids were researching freddy and his mother got involved and we find out about how he was born and all that . it was cool and interesting .		3		0

before watching prey , i wrongly thought to the underrated horror 's sub-genus about giant animals or , at least , , it was not like that ; the villains are simple lions from africa not to mention the screenwriters of this crap.the most important fail this movie has is the screenplay with totally stupid characters and absurd scenes.the screenwriters did not know how to make a solid and credible story , so they preferred to create stupid the ending is totally stupid and it also is an insult to the is a totally pathetic movie , very boring and you wan na see a film with a similar story , i recommend you 's stupid but it 's totally fun .		3		0
that people come to praise ` sei donne per l'assassino ' -lrb- 1964 -rrb- as a wonderful movie is totally beyond me . oh yes i understand how their brains work and yes , the lighting is key in creating a stunning visual style . but once you acknowledged mario bava 's work to create this style , there only remains enormous flaws to list . i agree ` la maschera del demonio ' -lrb- 1960 -rrb- was tense so you would n't have the time to notice the flimsy story , poor directing and lame acting . in this trend-setting color flick the style is clearly over the top : the irrational lighting , the vivid colors and the slow pace of the shots , all really create an atmosphere of its own . yet there 's absolutely no substance to sustain this surreal setting . actors are lame puppets brought together or aside in a storyline . the framing of the shots is heavy and monotonous . the interior shots all look the same , which would induce a claustrophobia feeling if there was a real suspense to keep us on the edge of our seats but only adds up to the global film-making cheapness . the worst comment critics can do about a boring movie they despise is compare it to watching paint dry . i would only say that a book of still photographs from this movie must be a real masterpiece . now , those who over-hyped this dull motion picture are certainly proud of their taste , for me they just have zero ability to see beyond the big fat style : they are -lrb- fortunately some are fun enough to find some kind of social commentary in a thoroughly uninteresting yet colorful dud , ha -rrb- .		3		0
the hills have eye ii -lrb- 1985 -rrb- i was not fan of the first movie , at all , i just thought remake was so much better and scarier but still was watchable i thought it was good idea to bring back cast from first movie and dog , i do like that connection to first movie . then they show a lot of flashback to first movie , which i thought were not bad at all but they just kept on bringing even more flashback , then they go overboard by giving dog a flashback . i love dogs but come on ! i did expect really bad movie but it was really poor but i did not expected to be laughing throughout the whole movie . any action scene this movie that were meant to scare just felt so bad that were funny and then at the end with dogs who push mutant from cliff . 3/10 really poor movie but it made laugh so much .		3		0
i was familiar with the michael myers characters , but never got around to watching the movies . i expected something very scary , something unique that would break the barriers that recent michael myers films had found them in . but what i got was awful ... michael myers grows up with a lap dancer for a mother , a abusive father , and a sister who likes to sleep around . he spends his nights secretly killing his animals until the desire to kill something bigger takes over and he massacres his family ... 15 years on , myers returns from his prison to kill ... the neighbours . i thought the film started off strong , it had some good performances from the actor who played the young myers , but as the film went on it became slower and duller ... it almost seems to me that the director realised he was running out of time and just sent myers on a quick killing spree ... the three lead , were brainless ... strutting around naked ... no sense whatsoever ...		3		0
this speculative biopic of the controversial fbi director stars leonardo dicaprio . the story opens in 1970 , as hoover is dictating his history of the bureau ; in flashbacks , we see his pivotal role the case and his battles with communists , the roosevelts , kennedys , and martin luther king , jr. . he was also obsessed with his doting mother -lrb- judi dench -rrb- and his long-time assistant director , clyde tolson -lrb- armie hammer -rrb- . the story is , in turns , exciting and boring , heartfelt and cheesy and has two insurmountable flaws : dicaprio is horribly miscast as hoover -lrb- he still looks and sounds like boyish jack dawson , despite supposedly aging 53 years -rrb- and the terrible old-age make-up used for hoover , tolson , and hoover 's secretary -lrb- naomi watts -rrb- is absolutely terrible . tolson , in particular , looks like boris karloff 's mummy and even though director eastwood filmed the entire movie in dim , half-light , the make-up is distracting and never convincing . i found the story of hoover 's life interesting and came away feeling quite sorry for this sad , tortured man , but the casting and make-up ruined it for me .		3		0
this movie picks up somewhat from where the last one left off and it is not very good . myers having endured the shotgun barrage is found by a dude living in a shack . for some reason he keeps myers a whole year in an unconscious state and when halloween comes about myers shows his appreciation by killing the guy who deserved to die for letting myers stay there without reporting it . he once again goes after his niece who is still annoying , but thankfully at the beginning of this one she ca n't talk . we are introduced to the sister again and this friend who we have never seen before , but apparently means more to the little girl than her sister . the girl is connected to myers somehow and throws fits whenever he is about to kill . unfortunately , this fits save no one as after the person is warned they get away , decide there is no danger and get killed . on the plus side we get to see this real jerk get killed . myers scratches his car then kills him , it was sweet . another scene has the gal we have never seen , but means so much to the little girl get saved by the police , but then she just has to go see her jerk boyfriend . typical gal , everyone says do n't go , but they do . the last part of the film has pleasance using the girl as bait to capture myers . the most absurd part of the movie comes here as myers takes off his mask and reveals no scars from the fire that engulfed him . and what is with the tear on myers cheek ... that was quite lame . how myers gets defeated in this one is laughable too , considering he survived that shotgun attack and being totally consumed in flames . on the plus side this movie did give donald another movie he could headline . and i just have to mention this , but all through the movie you see the feet of this guy . all you see is black boots and a black long coat . that is where the cash reference came in . i have no idea who is , i think it is explained in part six , but i missed that one .		3		0
detective breslin -lrb- quaid -rrb- is after someone who is killing people and hanging them on a contraption with hooks boring into the skin . ouch ! double ouch ! ouch ! ouch ! ouch ! i like horses . i thought this was going to be a horse movie . fooled again . no , it has to do with murders and bible prophecy . ok , but dennis quaid is in it so it ca n't be too bad . fooled again . there is a mixture of quaid 's character detective breslin agonizing over not being there for his two boys after his wife 's death and the bizarre murders cropping up all over the place . the mixture needed more stirring . the murders are gory , bloody , perverse and it 's hard to watch the crime scenes where the victims are hung up on some contraption with hooks boring into the skin . makes your skin crawl when you see it . but , they do a very good job of showing this . are they to be congratulated for this ? i think not . i like dennis quaid . i thought this was going to be a good dennis quaid movie . fooled again . something went very wrong . the story for the most part . the clues are loosely presented to represent the four horsemen of the apocalypse and what will happen to mankind when the veil is lifted . give me a break . the ending is not surprising because the people in charge forgot to introduce other characters who may be the suspects so that leaves ... ... ... ... . well , i 'll let you figure it out . you wo n't like it . you wo n't believe it . you will want your money back . also the ending is incomplete as one can not put oneself onto a contraption with hooks in the skin . so who put this person on the contraption ? the killer or accomplice was n't caught . i like horses . next time i see a movie title with `` horse '' somewhere in the title , i will read the box to make sure i will be watching horses and will try not to be fooled again . violence : yes . sex : no . nudity : no . language : yes , some , not much		3		0
this is a film which featured four different accounts of a rape and murder , seeing it from different . that 's an interesting premise , and was copied , by the way , very well in an american television show a few years ago called `` boomtown . '' unfortunately , `` boomtown '' did a better job of it than director akira kurosawa . however , since kurosawa is one of those `` untouchables , '' meaning the critics always rave about anything the guy does -lrb- a la bergman , hitchcock , etc. -rrb- this movie gets great reviews . this is very slow moving , way too repetitive and extremely boring , even with the short playing time . the only redeemable quality is the cinematography . it 's just laughable to read people calling this snorefest `` a masterpiece . '' what a stupid cliché !		3		0
rachel miner screams and writhes around uncomfortably for almost the whole length of the movie , trapped as she is in her worst nightmare . she and her therapist -lrb- mimi rogers -rrb- are stranded in the middle of nowhere when her therapist decides that revisiting the scene of her mother 's accidental death will be good therapy for her and give her some closure . of course , just the opposite . it 's no closure for the audience either . your enjoyment of this attempt at horror depends on whether you can tolerate watching rachel miner in numerous close-ups unable to deal with her phobia of cars , screaming and whimpering in dialog that consists mostly of , `` somebody help me ! '' , caught as she is in a car stuck between two trees , unable to get out . the best that can be said for mimi rogers is that she makes a wonderful corpse -- never once flinching as she remains seated in the car , mercifully oblivious to the script once she has died . this is the sort of flick that gives horror films a bad name , aptly living up to its title in more ways than one . has to be one of the worst horror films i ever sat through , waiting for a payoff at the end . no such luck . summing up : worth skipping .		3		0
`` the horse whisperer '' is not a good movie . the scenery and the cinematography are great , but the rest ... the story starts with an accident that change an adolescent girl 's life . but the horse which was also involved in the accident is traumatized and needs a `` psychologist '' ... robert redford . kristin scott thomas , the girl 's mother , takes the horse to redford 's farm and they fall in love . well , i think that the main character of the movie is the horse , and that makes it really unsatisfying . kristin scott thomas had a great performance in `` the english patient '' -lrb- one of my favorite movies -rrb- , but here she plays an irritating woman and she does n't convince the audience . i can say the same about redford , but it 's not the first time he does n't convince . it happened the same thing in `` up close and personal '' -lrb- not even the wonderful michelle pfeiffer - my favorite actress - plays her character well -rrb- . `` the horse whisperer '' is very long and slow , and the romance between kristin and redford does n't have a good chemistry . the music is quite good but , in general , the movie is uninteresting . it surprised me a lot its nominee for best dramatic movie in this year 's golden globe . why ? did the american people like it ? -------------------- 4		3		0
this movie is extremely boring and it has a lot of cheap sentimentalism .1 -rrb- i put this movie 3 only for dakota fanning , who has a great performance .2 -rrb- sean penn brings a bad performance and i can not believe how he was nominated to the academy awards as best actor in a leading role for this movie.i thought that it was going to be a good film but i was totally wrong . michelle pfeifer and laura dern are good actresses , so it is impossible to believe that both were involved on this movie.so i do not recommend this boring film which is full of cheap you want to see a good drama without cheap sentimentalism , watch the italian movie la stanza del figlio .		3		0
`` the story we tell ourselves about ourselves in order to account for what we are doing , is a lie . the truth lies outside , in what we do . '' - zizek a near scene-for-scene remake of 1939 's `` the four feathers '' , michael cimino 's `` the deer hunter '' tells the story of several friends -lrb- robert deniro , christopher walken -rrb- from small town pennsylvania . early sequences watch as the gang work in a steel mill , congregate and go on hunting expeditions . cimino 's photography , aided by cinematographer vilmos zsigmond , is grand throughout , but the film quickly nosedives into pretentious , unintentionally funny territory . cimino indulges in a prolonged wedding sequence -lrb- cribbed from coppola who cribbed from visconti -rrb- , filters `` best years of our lives '' through a vietnam era prism , has deniro run about naked like a method actor fishing for oscars , and treats us to a forced sequence in which our heroes play chopin on a piano whilst looking really really serious . this is a deep movie , see . the hell of industrial america then becomes the hell of the vietnam war . here our heroes , now american soldiers , watch north vietnamese savages kill civilians . they 're then captured by the vietnamese and made to play russian roulette . they survive this ordeal , but walken 's character is pushed into madness and begins to play russian roulette for money in a saigon gambling hall . symbolically unable to escape the damage done by vietnam , he spends six years there , gambling with bullets . you 'd think the law of averages would catch up with him , but no . `` do n't leave me over there , '' walken tells his buddy deniro , which leads to deniro having the longest delayed reaction in the history of cinema . eight years later he goes back to saigon in the hopes of finding walken , a missing person 's search which is apparently really easy . they find each other , walken commits suicide -lrb- partially to punish - and prove his love to - `` best man '' deniro -rrb- , the film ends with a funeral and a silly , unearned scene in which our gang sing `` god bless america '' . you can feel cimino straining with every scene to make a great epic . the film won five oscars . like most vietnam war movies , `` hunter '' hinges on romanticised madness . deer hunting becomes a metaphor for `` virtuous , humane kills '' and russian roulette becomes a metaphor for the madness inducing chaos of vietnam . as is typical of racist war films , the vietnamese are portrayed as grinning -lrb- their dialogue is not even vietnamese -rrb- , oriental savages -lrb- introduced with propagandistic scenes showing the nva killing babies and women -rrb- and the `` reason '' for us defeat is sidestepped by making the vietnam war itself incomprehensible . where else but in an irrational country could the us lose a war ? whilst several sequences play with irony -lrb- playing russian roulette etc -rrb- , cimino 's tale is one of solemn tragedy . an account of what evil , sadistic , barbaric vietnamese did to poor , innocent americans , the film , like `` apocalypse now '' , oozes macho self pity with a dash of counter-culture disillusionment and strained appeals to high culture -lrb- conrad , eliot , chopin songs , orthodox hymns etc -rrb- . the film is silly elsewhere , with random helicopter rescues , love triangles , many cheesy `` dramatic '' scenes and exploitative roulette sequences -lrb- why 's everyone in playing roulette ? -rrb- which cimino shoe-horned from another las vegas themed script he was working on . some critics , like jonathan rosenbaum , spotted the film 's hokiness right away . pulitzer prize winner peter arnett would call it a `` simplistic lie '' . as with most war movies , the overriding message is `` look what they did to us '' . cimino perpetuates the racist stereotype that sustained much of america 's involvement in indochina , and hides behind designer madness and much irrationality . compare to pontecorvo 's `` burn ! '' , which offered a clear analysis of imperialist expansion , and `` in the year of the pig '' and `` hearts and minds '' , two documentaries which the cia waged war upon and whose theatres met with bomb threats . in 2012 , the pentagon began the vietnam war commemoration project , a 13 year , 65 million dollar propaganda effort to clean up the image of the vietnam war . what are they covering up ? the fact that the north vietnamese constituted a political movement with near total local , popular support , that the us artificially divided vietnam in disregard of geneva negotiations -lrb- becase eisenhower knew over 80 percent of the population would vote for ho chi minh -rrb- , that the us put in place and backed psycho puppet leaders , that even the south did n't support the us , that the us did everything it could to prevent unification and scuttle elections , that 4 million vietnamese died , that more bombs were dropped than in all previous wars combined , that tens of thousands were assassinated by the cia 's phoenix program , that nukes were threatened 13 times , that us still kill vietnamese to this day -lrb- and counting -rrb- , that millions of gallons of poison , herbicide and chemicals were used , that us campaigns in cambodia were directly responsible for the rise of the khmer rouge under pol pot -lrb- himself supported with 89 million dollars -rrb- and the genocide which took place afterwards , that the first tonkin gulf incident was started by us aggression , that the second never happened , that over five million villagers were forcibly displaced , that political prisoners were in `` tiger cages '' and that 90 percent of northern levees , hospitals , villages , towns and industries were intentionally bombed . the us has similarly over 70 countries in the past 100 years . and yet here 's a film with the nva torturing small-town americans . during and after the iraq war , us soldiers committed suicide at a rate of 1 every 25 hours . this figure does n't include attempted suicides -lrb- roughly 1900 in 2009 alone -rrb- . in vietnam , the number of us suicides totalled about 150,000 . in real life , these vets were trapped in a double bind , unable to reconcile their belief that their conflict was righteous with their actual deeds ; they thus nihilistically self-destructed . cimino wants you to believe the opposite ; that the nva pushed men to suicide . 3/10 -- depressing .		3		0
ok i am not gon na watch this movie again . its boring but picks up towards the end . based on lame and pathetic idea that what happens with you in high school king of stays with you and may haunt you again in your life . very little laughs , you may learn from this movie that you should learn by your past and everyone deserves a second chance . great female cast but not a good story or screenplay at all . jamie and sigourney were nice , kristen and odette were ok , but betty white steals every scene she is in and i kind of liked that guy , kristen 's bro in this movie lolz . you again is often diverting , and has enough elements of realism in it to make you recall your own high school days -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- , but it does n't overcome the limitations imposed on it by its script , or a story that we 've all frankly heard before . story is very predictable and there is nothing else very special about this movie . should have been much better . not recommended but you have nothing else to see then wait for the dvd and see it when you are bored and need some cheesy flick . not for me tough .		3		0
if you can swallow the beautiful and sexy mandy moore as an uncoordinated doofus with low self-esteem who ca n't find a decent guy to go out with her , then you may be able to get into the spirit of `` because i said so . '' however , you 'll also have to put up with diane keaton in a truly grating performance as a neurotic control freak of a mother who spends most of her time obsessing over the romantic travails of her youngest daughter , going so far as to post an ad on an internet dating site seeking out prospective husbands for the unsuspecting girl . the actions of this modern-day yenta the matchmaker set into motion a whole host of sitcom-level complications and romantic comedy hijinks that are somehow supposed to be funny but wind up being merely irritating . the screenplay by karen leigh hopkins and jessie nelson comes replete with a bevy of mother/daughter relationship clichés , with some really lame slapstick routines - keaton getting stuck on an internet porn site , keaton getting run over by a skater in a park , keaton getting a cake in her face etc. - thrown in for bad measure . beyond keaton and moore , gabriel macht , tom everett scott and lauren graham are just some of the other unfortunate actors trapped inside this `` chick flick '' fiasco .		3		0
what a lousy movie ! did the producers ever see the end product ? how could they release this crap . -lrb- spoilers , if this thing could be spoiled , are ahead . -rrb- did n't d'artagnan get shot while in the river . what happened to the wound ? did n't francesca get shot in the chest ? what happened to the wound ? young d'artagnan meets with an old man then 14 years later d'artagnan , as a young man , is still with him though the old man did not age and seemed to be wearing the same clothes . why did the the 4 musketeers have to sneak through the sewers to get into the castle when minutes later swarms of homeless waltz right in . and why did the king and queen have to escape , from their own palace , through the same sewers then appear back in the palace the next day . was sewer time booked and the director just had to work it into the script . how was febre actually killed ? the climatic scene where the really bad guy fights the good guy , the scene anticipated throughout the movie , is so poorly handled that you are n't sure how the bad guy was killed . and the scene of climbing the castle walls on ropes . the batman tv show had more realistic rope climbing . this was a ridiculous movie .		3		0
`` boogeyman '' is about a young man , tim -lrb- barry watson -rrb- , who suffered from severe nightmares as a kid and claimed that a ` boogeyman ' that lived in his closet was responsible for his father 's bizarre disappearance one evening when tim was just a boy . tim decides to face his childhood fears that have been haunting him , by returning the victorian home that he once lived in , and decides to spend the night there to conquer his fears . but he yet again discovers that whatever entity is living within the home is still there , and it was n't just his imagination - its real . a night of terror ensues as tim is thrown in and out of reality , battling with the boogeyman who terrorized him as a child . reading my plot synopsis , you may ask , `` that 's it ? '' . well , yes , that is it , and i was trying to elaborate a little in my synopsis , so it may have made it sound better than it actually is . my biggest problem with this film was that it was just so random and ungrounded . the title , `` boogeyman '' , may put off some viewers from the start , but i decided to give this brisk little horror flick the benefit of the doubt and give it a rent . not so happy that i did , because i found it to be a fairly generic horror movie with weak writing . the entire premise was just kind of bland and empty - not much happened throughout the entire movie . clichés abound endlessly , with jump scare after jump scare , almost all of them being meaningless to the story . creepy little girls who befriend the protagonist , and seem to have a connection to the boogeyman as well - in fact , her character 's existence was supposed to lead to a big plot twist , but i saw it coming from a mile away . acting-wise , i have to admit it was n't bad . barry watson , who gained fame from playing one of the kids on the television series , `` 7th heaven '' , turns in a decent performance as our lead . emily deschanel plays a friend of watson 's from his childhood -lrb- you may recognize her from the television series , `` bones '' -rrb- , and she was good as well . the rest of the supporting cast is decent too , but the actors really did n't have much to work with . and while the acting is permissible , it does n't do much to save the film . as for the blow-out of a conclusion , i found it to be quite ridiculous , and it made the entire movie seem even more unscary and more unintelligent than it already was . i would have opted for a more subtle `` boogeyman '' villain , because the entire thing was n't working . all in all , `` boogeyman '' is a generic horror flick with weak writing and very little going for it . the script goes nowhere , and i felt the entire premise was pieced together sloppily . there 's really no scary material here , and the overuse of the jump scare tactic gets tiresome . more than likely , horror fans -lrb- and non -rrb- will want to pass on this film , because there 's nothing here worth wasting your time on . 3/10 .		3		0
a motocross team backed by tommy , who has invented a super fuel that will change the way of racing , must trek across the desert to compete in a competition . however tommy gets cold feet and rachel -lrb- aka ruby -rrb- decides that she will take the team . while , travelling on the bus they find out that they 're going to be late and so they decide -lrb- by a vote off -rrb- to take a detour and get themselves stranded after damaging the bus on the beaten track . unknowingly to them someone is watching them and waiting for their chance to pounce . okay , so after reading and hearing how bad this flick is . i was reasonably surprised by it . i was expecting an atrocity , but what i got here was nothing more than a rancid slasher vehicle that has more in common with the 80s slasher gruel . that 's not to say i did n't find it insipid , but by its reputation i expected far worst , but its just another routine -lrb- that i found curiously fascinating -rrb- sequel trying to cash on the original with a few amusing sequences . what made the original a successful package , just did n't translate here . it 's not as brutal , aggressive and intense , while the adrenaline levels are very meek and it lacks that rough edge . everything about it is uninspired , but there are a few random moments and ridiculous situations . like oh it 's pointless flashback time ! poor bobby ... poor ruby and even the superstar of a dog beast chimes in . why ? well , to remind just how better the original is compared with this junk . it 's simply a retread of the original with the family being replaced by retarded teens and to up the suspense , one of them just happens to be blind . wes craven wrote and directed this lumbering mess and you could easily tell the creative juices were at an all time low . the most effective scenes occur when it has the blind girl unknowingly stumbling across her dead friends . some of the cast decided to hang around for the sequel . the favourite of the cannibal clan , pluto -lrb- who healed up very well -rrb- played by michael berryman adds a lot the flick . janus blythe who was ruby returns to take on her dwindling family and for a couple minutes at the beginning robert houston reprises his role as bobby . oh and not forgetting beast ! the rest of the pesky cast were either annoying fools or simply plain meat for the chopping board . on the other hand , tamara stafford was acceptable . john bloom is an eccentric comic brute -lrb- no , goose -rrb- in the part of papa jupiter 's older brother , the reaper . while , craven 's mind numbing material -lrb- especially the script -rrb- and direction left a lot to be desired . there was effective location photography put to good use by capturing the impressively foreboding backdrop . everything else is so-so or below par like the music score , uneven pacing , cut-away deaths with big casualty list , goofy stunt work -lrb- where the cannibals seem to lay the smack down -rrb- and a dead-weight story with full of `` come again moments ? '' and a very merry conclusion . a terribly soulless low-grade sequel by craven that i found oddly amusing .		3		0
ralph macchio and pat morita return as teacher and student who travel to okinawa to see 's dying father and it is here where morita must confront a deadly enemy who is looking to avenge his honor . while daniel must end up fighting for the same reason in this excruciatingly dull film . there are many problems with this movie , the number one problem is that the story works better as a sequel to kickboxer than it does to a karate kid . i mean had this been an r rated and harder edged type of action flick that the plot typically calls for , this may have worked . unfortunately though it is treated as drama and all we watch is the interaction between these people , now do n't get me wrong , if a drama actually creates a credible situation and gives us characters worth caring about , then it can be something . -lrb- kill bill volume 1 and 2 -rrb- however when the material is this cheesy -lrb- avenged honor ? -rrb- you need lots of martial arts action . this is not the case and we get too much filler and not much excitement . indeed this is one extremely boring movie . the climax at the end is a to the death fight and well you ca n't do this in a pg movie . not well , anyway . * 1/2 out of 4 - -lrb- poor -rrb-		3		0
this is a very unfortunate movie because it is funny when it really should n't be why a beaver ? really ? most of us know what a beaver can mean so you 're immediately setting yourself up for ridicule from the get-go by having a beaver hand puppet gibson actually has an evil dead style fight with his beaver at one point during the movie , yes it 's the possessed hand scene only this one is supposed to be serious so gibson plays a depressed guy who can only communicate through his beaver hand , that 's more or less the story and he does so in a cockney style accent . . like don logan in sexy beast only without the intended black humour they try to set a sombre tone with a bit of radiohead here and there etc but it does n't work . depression is a very serious issue and one that needs to be approached with some delicacy i just found this movie to be very heavy handed and they miss the mark by some considerable margin maybe watch it if you 're depressed it might make you feel better !		3		0
the simple version : snow white & the huntsman good , mirror mirror bad . or , put another way , charlize theron 's ravenna stuns both with beauty and a fearsome performance while julia roberts ' queen merely scares with an over performance deserving of a razzie . you know the story of snow white so i wo n't précis it here . suffice it to say , mirror mirror attempts to retell it with humour and exotic style from the point of view of the nasty queen . it 's a reasonable attempt that would be passable were it not for the superior version from rupert sanders and the fact that i watched them as a double bill . oh , and it feels seventy years out of date . it 's all so melodramatic with a score and is an absolute chore to sit through . whereas theron , in her film , is pure , beautiful malevolence , in mirror mirror , julia roberts does n't come across as remotely evil but as an unpleasant , spoilt brat . she barks her way through this clunky , awkward , drawn-out film and , though there are moments of brightness and humour , none can offset the rest of her awful performance in this celluloid tripe . she is not alone , though ; virtually everyone feels as though they are acting in a 1920s b-movie . as for lilly collins , she takes melodrama to a completely new level and her annoying is overshadowed only by those great big hairy caterpillars pretending to be eyebrows ; absolutely the scariest characters in mirror mirror . her love interest , prince alcott -lrb- armie hammer taking the easy pay cheque -rrb- , is suitably schmaltzy and they deserve each other , but do we really care ? yes , the cgi sets are fun but poorly produced and the exteriors are so badly lit they accentuate the obvious studio setting of the film . again , the costumes are bold and colourful but they lack the beauty and quality of snow white & the huntsman 's and , for the most part , lilly collins resembles like small , twee child who 's raided the dressing up box in a bid to look like her older sister but with embarrassing results . the closing song leaves us in no doubt that snow white believes in love -lrb- we know that because she repeats it endlessly -rrb- but it is so badly edited that it leaves us in no doubt that she 's miming -lrb- badly -rrb- . it comes across as an attempt to close the mirror mirror on a high note à la slumdog millionaire but it is nothing more than a colourful , ugly , cacophonous mess . at least mirror mirror is consistent to the end . if you see only one snow white film this year , make sure it 's snow white and the huntsman . if you see two , watch it twice ! for more reviews from the squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk like the facebook page : http://on.fb.me/rpitog		3		0
right from the opening i knew i was going to end up hating `` pitch black '' just because i have a unfair lack of interest for the sci-fi genre . so we 're in a space shuttle and everything seems all futuristic and weird , the camera 's making a lot of use out of the hand-held , shake to create a feeling of panic and we crash land on this deserted planet with three suns , creating an extremely off-putting filter , you 'll be wishing it would just hurry up and turn pitch black ! the filters are really awful and in bad taste , the range from an over exposed filter to a strange black and white looking blue filter which does n't really make sense , it 's as if the directors just putting them there because he can . we are then introduced to far too many characters that we lose track of and therefore do n't particularly care about ! the least one being the `` hero '' riddick , played by the lack-luster vin diesal who thinks that he looks cool by wearing swimming goggles in the middle of the desert ! i thought he was about to jump into a pool or something ! anyway , he 's annoying and egotistical there 's no way we can like him especially as the other characters make out he 's the bad guy anyway ! after a long wait -lrb- about an hour -rrb- the film eventually revs up a bit , the planet plunges into darkness so we can get rid of the blinding filters and we 're treated to poorly animated aliens and the film then plays out as one big rip-off of `` aliens '' in the dark ! this swarm of creatures attack the group as we egg them on to , however admit there were times of excitement and some parts were well-paced . but when all is said and done `` pitch black '' is `` aliens '' with a clunky screenplay and just plain weird directing ! it 's full of unlikable characters and an empty ending . although there are times of suspense and exciting action , there needs to be more substance to find it engaging .		3		0
this movie is about a killer in a summer camp , so yes this is a bit of a clone of friday the 13th . this movie is also not very good , if you like it fine , but it just is not my thing . for one i did not find the ending all that shocking as i saw it coming even as a kid -lrb- let 's face it , the movie shows you clearly who survived the crash -rrb- . this movie is the typical slasher for the most part , with a person being killed here and there . if you like slashers it would probably be worth checking out . as for me , i just can not believe how high the ranking of this is here . this site is notorious for being hard on horror films yet this one has a somewhat good score . i do n't know , to me it just was n't anything all that special , even if you could n't figure out the ending and it was a surprise , there was more to the movie than that . this one also tries to be funny here and there and it fails , i absolutely hated the mother 's performance and she is n't even in the movie much . i am betting the sequels were not much better . so check it out if you are a slasher fan you may enjoy it . i just did n't .		3		0
this movie had been on my ` must see ' list for a long time , but now i know i 've been expecting too much . all ingredients seemed to be there , a sci-fi spoof with burton as director and a cast full of stars . comes to show names do n't tell all ... i do n't know what burton really tries with this one ... it 's not funny enough for a spoof -lrb- i actually do n't think i laughed even once -rrb- and not ` real ' enough to be an actual science-fiction flick ... so what 's going on here ? as for the actors , they seem puzzled as well what they are doing here ... nicholson is pretty good in his role and tom jones has a funny part ... that 's about it . oh and i thought of one good joke , when portman says something like ` it was n't the doves ' , when the aliens strike for the second time ... but for the rest , as i said , bleh ... 3/10 .		3		0
a real misfire , superman iii barely works at all , mainly because it has two great ideas for two separate films -lrb- clark kent returning to his home town of smallville and superman turning evil after an encounter with kryptonite -rrb- and does n't explore them in any satisfying depth , while throwing in a most unwelcome third story about a computer programmer who rips off his megalomaniac boss robert vaughn before being promoted so that he can help him take over the world . this element fails thanks to an unexciting , tired script and richard pryor 's intensely irritating performance . richard lester 's comic approach , which found a strong chemistry with richard donner 's footage in superman ii , is allowed to run riot here , and the results are almost entirely unfunny . in fact , the film seems to be a lester film first , a pryor vehicle second and a superman adventure last of all . the film 's single fantastic sequence is a memorable confrontation between clark kent and the evil superman in a junk yard ; other than that it 's a total mess , one that killed the series ' integrity with instant effect , though there would still be another instalment before the man of steel was laid to rest .		3		0
oh yeah , i forgot . it was based on a novel that was n't written by roderick thorpe -lrb- the guy who wrote die hard 1 -rrb- . wow no wonder . i never thought i 'd say this , but i was bored . watching a die hard movie ! i should n't be bored watching a die hard movie ! come on ! truthfully , there was not nearly enough action , the story was not as interesting as the first die hard . and the writers failed to put different characters in a die hard movie . not to say it 's a bad movie . it 's not a good one , but not bad . the action that is in it is good though . definitely the worst of the series .		3		0
edge of darkness heralds the return of mel gibson back to the front of the camera , and it 's been 8 years since he last left a starring role for the director 's chair , having to make films like passion of the christ , and apocalypto . i would have hoped he might have taught martin campbell a thing or two about how to deliver a film that can hold an audience 's interest , because edge of darkness is just so boring , that you 'll find tracing the lines on mel 's face a lot more interesting than to tune in to a bunch of characters that you could n't care less about . mel gibson stars as thomas craven , a lowly boston detective whose daughter emma -lrb- bojana novakovic -rrb- comes to visit during her break from work . in the span of 5 minutes we learn that she 's pretty , extremely smart , and as a nuclear scientist / research assistant who seemed to be poison in spy versus spy fashion , thomas commits a gerard butler 's clyde shelton in law abiding citizen , where opening the front door nowadays means death . daddy 's little girl got dispatched in brutal fashion , and this makes daddy angry . except that thomas spends most of the time walking wounded emotionally and hallucinating , trying to piece together disparate clues in order to find the bastards responsible for his daughter 's demise . also based on a british television series , this is no state of play , which also got itself transplanted across the atlantic into a big budgeted hollywood film , where one would expect thrills , spills and plenty of twists and turns . unfortunately , edge of darkness is not that kind of film , as the narrative is pretty flat with everyone behaving suspiciously or afraid of the shadowy powers that be , as represented by ray winstone 's jedburgh , a michael clayton type consultant who advises his clients just how to get out of the mess they 're in , involving nuclear weapons , terrorism , treason , profits , and corrupt government officials , corporate bigwigs and activists . but seriously , what it became was plenty of shadow play , of punching in the dark , of empty threats of who is in possession of a bigger member . it came to the point of the ridiculous with everyone verbally posturing just where they should be , , or we - , that it becomes the unintentional comedy . the absurdness continues when you know campbell lacks inspiration to direct a lacklustre william monahan and andrew bovell screenplay , where the bad guys all get dealt with in one fell swoop , with again , comedy stemming from stupidity . the conspiracy theory is so full of hocus pocus that will leave you wondering why a simple whistle-blower story , can be told in such an uninteresting manner , with neither a human emotional angle to reel you in , nor with any intelligence to multi-layer it . worse of all , it then decided to go the taken route , which was also about a father 's relentless , no nonsense search for his daughter . here the of time is removed , and thomas just goes about doing his own thing in piecing clues together , and toed the law as compared to liam neeson 's bryan mills who chose to operate outside the system . it was too little too late , and made you wonder just how this could have been summarized into a short film instead . actors were all going through the motions with nobody showing any emotional depth that make you feel for them , and for some reason everyone adopts the low baritone gruff voice when speaking to one another . and boy , do they just talk and talk a lot ! in trying to be smart , edge of darkness falls flat on its hype and exposed its lack of intelligence and wit . it 's amazing just how anyone can make a boring film , and this one is testament that it 's very possible . like one of the characters uttered in a self-fulfilling prophecy of the film itself , with a convoluted plot come a situation where there are no facts . well the truth is it 's also a situation where there 's no substance either . watching paint dry will give you more satisfaction .		3		0
collateral may well be the single most ridiculous and utterly absurd screenplay ever put into production by a major studio in this century - even uwe boll or timbo hines would notice the plot holes and gaps in logic . while the inexplicable critical praise for the film might be expected to result in some failure to live up to expectations , this fails on even the most basic levels of construction for the very dumbest of action movies -- and this certainly is the dumbest piece of hokum i 've seen in the past ten years . i 'm simply at a loss as to how anyone could think this thriller even a competent piece of drama , let alone a masterpiece . one of the problems with people who make more than one good movie is that we very unreasonably expect them to keep on making good movies instead of just being grateful for what they 've given us in the past . so i 'll go on being grateful to mann for manhunter , heat , the insider , the jericho mile and last of the mohicans -lrb- even if he is determined to re-edit the heart out of them if left unchecked -rrb- and mark this one down as a paycheck . it 's just a shame that , unlike terrence malick , nobody set up a trust fund for him so that he would n't have to make movies this bad just to pay the bills . the film starts off with a disadvantage -- the high concept setup is a hard premise to sell , and the film singularly fails to do so . but instead of going off in the ` we know this is stupid , but let 's have fun with it ' route , instead it tries to play it as serious psychodrama and character piece while offering some of the most ridiculous plotting imaginable . cruise is supposedly a top of his game hit-man , but is the most spectacularly inept killer the screen has ever seen , revealing himself to dozens of witnesses , beating up and shooting people in crowded nightclubs -lrb- the film 's utter lowpoint -rrb- and even accompanying his reluctant chauffeur on a visit to his mother in hospital . short of taking over a presidential press conference at gunpoint , it 's hard to imagine him drawing more attention to himself in almost every single scene . by the final reel when he turns into an indestructible relentless stalking the pair , you suddenly start to appreciate the finely crafted plots and elegant dialogue found in the works of dolph lundgren , jean-claude van damme and olivier gruner , none of whom have ever descended to such preposterous lows . it 's notable that jason statham kept his name off the credits in this one , and he had no such qualms over revolver . by the time the unbelievable coincidence of the passenger foxx falls for being -- shock , horror -- the last name on the list is wheeled on , we 've sat through so many much more unbelievable coincidences and idiotic lapses in logic and credibility that it almost seems rational . suspension of disbelief is one thing , but this is just extracting the urine . not that faulty suspension is the only thing wrong with this vehicle . none of the individual scenes ever convince or work on their own terms , with every development or line of dialog not just horribly telegraphed but practically written in the sky . characterization is equally facile and predictable , with only vague moments hinting at possibilities glossed over en route to the next botched setpiece . the performances are variable : cruise , foxx , javier bardem and , most surprisingly , the usually awful jada pinkett smith are fine but not outstanding , but mark ruffalo becomes increasingly laughable as it becomes ever clearer that the depth of his characterisation extends to doing a not very good john palmer impersonation . i take no pleasure in writing off this utter trainwreck of a movie . there could have been a good little straight-to-video movie in this , but the end result is a completely unacceptable effort that goes straight into my all-time ten worst list .		3		0
this movie wins hands down when it comes to rip off : `` peggy got married '' `` back to the future '' the highly superior matheson 's novel `` bid time return '' which was adapted for the screen as `` somewhere in time not to mention clair 's `` it happened tomorrow '' . elements are even taken from capra 's `` it 's a wonderful life '' this one takes naiveté and blandness to new limits : so let us change the world and it will be xmas everyday . i pass over in silence the macho side which barely allows the mother to say ten lines in the whole movie.a muddled serial killer affair which has more holes than a piece of swiss cheese and which badly interferes with the essential : jim and his poppa getting together . a lotta people seems to like this : more power to them .		3		0
the continuation of the star wars saga proves dramatically -lrb- plot wise -rrb- better than the previous film , but is even more wooden and stiff than before . george lucas simply can not direct , he never could and never will be able to turn out anything other than an okay film . fortunately for him , that one okay film , star wars , has been paying his bill for years . lucas seems to think that bigger is better on every level so he cranks things up an extra fifteen notches thanks to the leap frog jumps in digital technology . lucas has now built his entire movie against a blue screen which he fills with many wonderful sights . the locations and the designs are indeed wonderful , the problem is that in a year that brought lord of the rings and harry potter , lucas ' special effects are far from special since its the one film of the three where you know instantly where the real people end and their animated versions begin . the animation in this film is some of the worst computer variety ever put into a film with a budget this big . the failure of the visual effects keeps pulling you out of the story especially when its so badly acted by everyone on screen with the exception of christopher lee , samuel jackson and yoda . star wars as a franchise effectively died with the previous film and despite the occasional flash of life in this one its best to pull a sheet over its head and mourn the loss of a cultural icon .		3		0
in the insensate family comedy , marley & me , a young couple -lrb- owen wilson and jennifer aniston -rrb- buy a labrador puppy that we know the film wants us to regard as `` mischievous , '' `` lovable , '' `` cute , '' but which is , in reality , retarded , for when it grows to adulthood , it still has not learned one shred of discipline and can not control its bladder or destructive nature . i guess dog lovers think this is funny ? like hurricane katrina was funny to new orleans . owen wilson plays newspaper columnist , john grogan -lrb- the same name as the author of the idiotic book of the same name - a special kind of conceit going on there , i 'm sure -rrb- ; jennifer aniston is his writer wife , named ... jennifer , who is only a writer until it does n't matter any more in the script . grogan buys his wife a puppy , names it marley after bob , to distract her from wanting a child ; `` something other than you that she has to take care of . '' dog then creates expensive , insensate havoc , mistaken for comedy by people who laugh at fart jokes : dragging restaurant tables , eating furniture , carpet , clothes , wrecking screen doors , breaking everything , eating jennifer 's necklace , barking incessantly , pissing and shitting wherever it wants to ... that 's the movie . the whole movie . stupid dog destruction piled on stupid dog destruction , with human subplots thrown in to salvage a shred of interest . i suspect alice cooper would especially like the dead baby tangent -lrb- jennifer has a miscarriage -rrb- , and every man who was dragged to this movie by his puling girlfriend will at least get to ogle the bikini chicks who ca n't act . dog-lovers will irrationally love marley & me - all other sentient humans will be edging for a slip of knocker from one of the bikini babes or jennifer aniston that will never come . marley & me is not in the least funny , although in some braindead alternate universe where people regard dogs as more deserving of life over their own primate species , it is hilarious . alan arkin , as grogan 's editor , provides the only levity , without even trying to - just being alan arkin . eric dane is grogan 's successful journalist buddy , sebastian -lrb- look up smug in the dictionary , there 's a picture of this guy -rrb- . kathleen turner as a dog trainer , in her first role since the sex change to hunchback of notre dame . movie tries to provide substance with jennifer 's failed pregnancy . but after she raises three healthy kids , we ask ourselves : what was the point of that sidetrack ? movie tries to contrast sebastian 's womanizing , globetrotting life with grogan 's fraying family rut . at one point , jennifer is so frustrated with two babies and marley destroying furniture and waking the babies , that she requests marley 's ousting . in saying the one sensible thing in the movie , she and grogan get into a fight that spills over into their frustration with their lives . but no one forced them to spawn two kids . no one asked them to retain the retarded dog after its reason for distracting jennifer became obsolete . i do n't get it . and please do n't try to explain it to me . i fail to see how this dog continually breaking things is funny . who in their right mind would find this precious ? the scariest part is , movie is lifted from the chronicles of the real life john grogan and his havoc canine . so upon deduction , we realize the people are the retarded ones . just as kids are the products of their parents ' upbringing -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- , so too must john grogan assume the blame as either derelict in his duties of raising the dog properly , or soft in the head for tolerating the dog 's erratic behaviour in the first place . marley & me gives us no reason to love its canine star . towards the end , there is too little , too late , as grogan gives an impassioned monologue on how marley once stayed up with grogan 's sick kid for eight hours , as an example of marley 's love . you absolutely sure the dog was not waiting for the kid to die so he could eat it ? are dog-lovers so needy they will latch onto any animal that exhibits what they consider `` love '' towards them , when in reality it is obeisance towards the entity that provides them food and shelter ? grogan 's last words , `` give him your heart and he 'll give you his '' are such a laboriously twisted spin on what we 've just witnessed for the last 120 minutes that we realize we are watching some kind of pathological study in denial . evidently , a dog `` giving you his heart '' involves eating your furniture continually , pissing anywhere indoors , humiliating you in public , knocking over your kids , waking your babies , causing thousands of dollars of damage every week ... and remaining untrained all its life until it dies . at marley 's deathbed , when grogan declares his love for marley , we realize that at no point in this ludicrous film did we ever feel that grogan and his wife ever loved their kids as much as their mutt . and the dog only dies to shamelessly tug at the heartstrings of this film 's demographic - the fart-joke lovers ... montage , manipulative music , the tears of children , platitudes - it 's all here . and the dog-lovers eat it up like furniture . constitutes one of mankind 's greatest anyway . it has nothing to do with love of animals or unselfishness or instincts ; it is about - as vincent price once leered on an alice cooper record - the `` inborn need to dominate , possess '' ; the same reason zoos exist . sebastian tells grogan , `` you got a kid , you 're a dad . you got a dog , you 're a master . '' okay - movie , roll over and play dead . -- review by poffy the cucumber -lrb- for poffy 's movie mania -rrb- .		3		0
we have already learned that johnny blaze -lrb- nicholas cage -rrb- sold his soul to the devil to become the ghost rider , a demonic bounty hunter who takes on the appearance of a flaming skeleton in a leather jacket . he rides a motorcycle , also flaming , and carries with him a chain which he uses as a weapon . about midway through `` ghost rider : spirit of vengeance , '' we learn that his powers extend beyond even this -- according to what he tells a young boy , at least . it seems that , when he has to pee , he unzips his fly and lets loose a steady stream of fire , like a flamethrower . all of a sudden , i understand the euphemistic meaning of the word `` fireman . '' never mind the fact that , as a skeleton , the ghost rider would lack the equipment necessary to produce a stream of any kind . of course , this is not the kind of movie that bothers to think along such lines . i was not a fan of 2007 's comic book adaptation `` ghost rider , '' although i would happily sit through it a second time if it meant never again having to see the sequel . on so many levels , `` spirit of vengeance '' is painfully bad . it tells a story that does n't even try to make sense . cage gives what will undoubtedly be regarded as his worst performance , and his costars do n't fare much better . no one is helped by dialogue so excruciatingly juvenile , it 's as if the screenplay was written by with short attention spans . the story and some of the screen writing credit is given to david s. goyer , who can no longer coast by on his involvement with `` the dark knight . '' with films like `` the invisible , '' `` jumper , '' and `` the unborn '' all under his belt , he has officially disappointed me one too many times . on top of everything , the film in no way benefits from its over-hyped 3d effects . we 're not immersed , and we can barely make out that something is flying off the screen -- or even that the person standing closer to the camera has more definition than the person standing further away . it did n't help that the picture was so unpleasantly dim ; day scenes looked like they took place at dusk , and night scenes were barely visible . even the title 's characters blazing skull , which i naturally expected to look bright and glowing , was a murky ball of dirty yellow flames . i would normally recommend you save the extra money and opt for a 2d projection , but in this particular case , i recommend you save your money entirely and not see the movie at all . dimension -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- is only part of what makes it so bad . since the events of the first film , blaze has left the united states and is hiding out in a remote part of eastern europe . he broods over his curse , in which he turns into the ghost rider in the presence of evil and feeds on souls . he 's sought out by his friend , moreau -lrb- idris elba -rrb- , a member of secretive church sect . if i 'm remembering correctly , his job was to protect a boy named danny -lrb- fergus riordan -rrb- and his mother , nadya -lrb- violante placido -rrb- , as it seems danny is somehow involved in some kind of satanic conspiracy . but moreau failed ; both danny and nadya have been kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by nadya 's former lover , ray -lrb- johnny whitworth -rrb- . he 's now in league with the devil in human form , named roarke -lrb- ciarán hinds , replacing peter fonda -rrb- , who wants the boy for his own evil purposes . the connections are a bit arbitrary and rather confusing . it seems that , like blaze , nadya made a pact with the devil -- only in her case , she was pregnant at the time . is danny the devil 's son ? narrative logistics would make this impossible , unless i 'm forgetting something important , which is quite possible given how hard it was for me to follow the story . we do know that danny will gain hellish superpowers when he comes of age and goes through a ritual , the time of which is rapidly approaching . hence , all the chasing across the back roads of europe and the middle east . whatever the specifics , moreau wants blaze and his demonic other half to find mother and son and protect them . in return , blaze is promised a way for his curse to be lifted . at roarke 's behest , ray is transformed into a supernatural being with the ability to make things decay simply by touching them . this does allow for one amusing scene in which he tries to eat someone 's lunch ; after picking up a sandwich and an apple and watching both disintegrate into nothing , he grabs hold of a twinkie , which remains intact . a cute moment , however , does n't excuse the delivery of lines that would n't pass muster in a raunchy teen comedy . this goes double for cage , maybe even triple . there 's a scene early on in which blaze confronts a sleazy club owner while trying his hardest to keep the ghost rider under control ; cage 's lines , coupled with his goofy style of verbal and physical convulsing , make for one of the most embarrassing performances he has ever given . he has made his share of bad movies over the last few years , but `` ghost rider : spirit of vengeance '' is going to be a tough one to live down . -- chris pandolfi -lrb- www.atatheaternearyou.net -rrb-		3		0

this is truly one of the most awful horror movies i 've ever seen . the acting is terrible , the story is terrible , it 's longer than it has to be , and it just gets ridiculous in the end . this movie is supposed to be the story of the family that lived in the house before the lutz 's , even though it 's so far fetched and fabricated , you would n't even know it . it goes so far to prove that the son was possessed , that they actually have him transform into a demon at the end of the movie . this movie is a waste of everyones time , and so is every amityville movie beyond this . 3/10		3		0
my two favorite things in the world are slumber parties and massacres so having both represented in a horror film title was titillating to say the least . slumber party massacre boasting a movie poster that had four scantly clad women viewed from between the legs of the killer was something of teenage pin up fantasy . the phallic killing weapon of choice is a portable drill with a bit the size of john holmes . the victims are a bunch of high school girls that look as old as college sophomores but thanks to the tight form fitting fashions of the time -lrb- the film was shot in 1982 -rrb- they are every bit as sexually stimulating as they were intended . so with the setting established -- a slumber party at the home of one of the girls homes , the characters all exposed as expendable and the killer on the loose after having escaped authorities , we were set for some bloodletting . there is nothing new about slumber party massacre . even in 1982 , the film was a rip of just about every other horror film that was hitting the theatres in rapid releases . even the film 's score was an organ key shade away from john carpenter 's classic halloween winning number . surprisingly directed by amy holden jones -lrb- women directing horror films were not of the norm -rrb- , the film does at least try to use the horror playbook to ensure that all the plays are executed . we have a shower scene that is definitely a press pause and zoom experience . there are countless individuals that are lined up as plausible victims . and there is a killer that has a kill toy of choice even if he does n't have any kind of personality present within the film 's frames . slumber party massacre was originally written with the intention of being a slasher movie spoof . it was reconstructed into the straight horror that it ends up becoming , but the resonating humor is still present throughout the film . one of the worst things that can happen after viewing a horror film is having the details of the film forgotten . this is exactly slumber party massacre 's problem . i remember the shower scene , but just two days since my revisit to the experience , i ca n't remember anything notable about the films plot , it 's characters and most importantly , it 's killing . www.robertsreviews.com www.killerreviews.com		3		0
this had a lot of potential . things are set up pretty well . we have the jail break -lrb- which seems a bit easy to pull off -rrb- , an evil nazi spy , who has forced a nice old man -lrb- who knows the secrets of invisibility -rrb- to work for him because he keeps his daughter locked up in a room next to his lab . there is a buffoon running around with a shotgun , because the spy says he may be able to reunite him with his son , and a femme fatale . the spy is a skinny guy who holds sway in the house , but seems to be gone a lot . the scientist should have at his disposal a lot of stuff to use against this guy . instead he sits and sulks . enter the prisoner , a safe-cracker named faust . he is more interested in robbing banks than helping steal radioactive materials for the spy . he plays a kind of bogart wannabe , full of swagger and gangster lingo . why did they need to pick this guy , such an unstable , unpredictable guy , to do their bidding . anyway , there are a couple of good invisibility scenes , especially one in a bank where faust 's head starts to come back into view -lrb- the guy 's method does n't work so well and eventually kills the user -rrb- . unfortunately , if viewed with the slightest discriminating eye , this becomes one of those movies you can pick apart from beginning to end . i got a kick out of the girl , finally coming out of the room , fully dressed , perky , and ready to leave . it 's as if she had her suitcases packed and was waiting by the door . had the script been handled with a little creativity , it could have worked pretty well .		3		0
american pie 2 starts off its rehash of the first film with the ever-present trailer gag . the trailer gag , of course , is one of the many gags that was played and played and replayed in the film 's trailer -lrb- s -rrb- and is therefore completely without effect when seen in the theaters . the barrage of teen sex of the last decade or so are plagued with trailer gags , and some of those movies -lrb- sorority boys -rrb- contain little else . here , we see jim 's -lrb- the unbearable jason biggs -rrb- father walk in as he and his girlfriend -lrb- if she could be called that , since they evidently have not even had ` friendly hello sex ' -rrb- are having sex . this intrusion is followed by that of jim 's mother , who has the obligatory fit , and then , mysteriously , both of natalie 's -lrb- jim 's ` girlfriend ' -rrb- parents . so within the first minutes of the film , we are given a stolidly unamusing scene involving the exact same sexual awkwardness that was present in every scene that eugene levy -lrb- jim 's father -rrb- and jim shared in the first movie , and we 're left wondering why natalie 's parents walked into the room at all . the rest of the movie is more of the same . in the movie 's defense , however , i must say that seann william scott was just as hilarious in every scene that he was in as he was in the first movie . the characters in both movies are hugely stereotypical caricatures of what , according to hollywood producers , the typical college kid looks and acts like , and stifler is the only one in either film that turns out even slightly amusing . it 's no secret that films of this type tend to feed relentlessly off their original films in order to provide most of the laughs -lrb- austin powers 2 -rrb- , or lack thereof -lrb- scary movie 2 -rrb- , but it can at least be said that that was done at a minimum in the case of american pie 2 . there is , thankfully , no ` pie , ' for example . on the other hand , the film does manage to feed off of other successful comedies . we see , for example , the introduction of stifler 's mini-me , as stifler 's younger brother enters the film , and is literally a miniature version of stifler . for the entire film that does n't contain stifler , however , just about every single comedic scene falls completely flat , as was also the case with several of the scenes that stifler was in -lrb- anything involving urine or , theoretically , lesbians , for example -rrb- . jim is once again cruelly thrown into every kind of awkward and embarrassing situation imaginable , leaving the audience not laughing , but also feeling awkward and embarrassed . there is , for example , the completely tasteless scene in which he is mistaken for a retarded trombone player - did nobody at that damn band camp know what this petey looked like ?! and the statement that jim utters at the abrupt end of his performance -lrb- branding him by far the most moronic character in the film for the rest of the movie -rrb- , will have your jaw on the floor in disgusted shock before you can say , ` oh my good god , you 're kidding . ' and all of the characters are back , too . oz is back with his sickeningly sweet relationship with his insufferable girlfriend heather , finch is back in one of the more amusing roles in the film , having become so obsessed with his reunion with stifler 's mom that he meditates almost constantly , and kevin is back again , having long since broken up with vicky -lrb- tara reid -rrb- . there is a curious interaction between kevin and vicky throughout the film . it 's obvious that there 's a lot of sexual tension and weirdness between them , but it 's impossible to care whether they get back together or not . there 's a scene early in the film in which they almost kiss , and vicky is put off , reminding him that they 're just friends in what i hope to no end is the worst scene that tara reid has ever acted . if it gets worse that that . there is an interesting paradox that comes with movies like the american pies and the scary movies and road trip and sorority boys that , logically , should reduce the films to complete failure almost immediately upon release . they are clearly jam-packed with the kind of humor that amuses 4th grade children -lrb- and even them for no other reason than because they know their parents would hate it -rrb- , yet they appear to be aimed at a late high school or -lrb- gulp -rrb- early college age audience . i was going to say that films like this can be watched just for a little fun , but then i wondered how much fun it is to watch a film in which a girl like nadia falls completely in love with idiot after idiot , and i began to wonder what it is that made the film 's producers and writers develop such an abysmally low opinion of their audience . is it because we made their first film such a huge success ? could it be that they are sending a message with this movie ? if they are , it 's probably something like this , ` you liked that garbage ?! well , take this !! ' there is a clear lesson to be learned here , people , and i hope that everyone has been taking note of it . if we all keep paying to see this trash that is constantly cranked out by hollywood , then we are only asking for more trash to be put on the menu . i think i said in my review of scary movie 2 that it 's a lot of fun even to watch films that are so bad that they are virtually un-enjoyable , if only to tear them down later in my review . i wo n't say that american pie delves to the unspeakably awful level that the scary movies both sunk to , but even writing reviews of the best bad movies gets old . a second sequel in this series is something that i would be more than happy to never see .		3		0
first of all , i am a huge fan of billy bob thornton . he is without a doubt one of my favorite actors working today , but with bad santa he illustrates , unfortunately , that even he is capable of providing a wonderful performance in an awful , awful movie . the abysmal script for bad santa calls for a relentlessly unlikable , distasteful person , and billy bob does more than necessary to fill that requirement . he is a remarkably versatile actor , i ca n't help being reminded of the diversity of such roles as the government official in armageddon , the greasy mechanic in u-turn , the intense racist in monster 's ball , the rather slow brother in the shocking film a simple plan , and the peculiar character that he played in sling blade . unfortunately , the fact that billy bob is among the most powerful actors acting today is not enough to add something to the empty script of bad santa , which scarcely has any more reason for existence than do the ridiculous scary movies , which are abysmally awful films which i am notorious for repeatedly badmouthing - and for good reason - in dozens of my other reviews . -lrb- spoilers -rrb- billy bob thornton plays the part of a dedicated drunk named willie -lrb- who deserves no last name and so is given none -rrb- who plays the part of the shopping mall santa claus once a year , with his sidekick marcus -lrb- tony cox who cleverly gets upset at being called `` you people , '' something which he has n't done since me , myself , and irene . these writers are so creative !!! -rrb- . marcus and willie do not do the job because they enjoy it or because they are interested in earning a little extra cash for the holidays , they do it because being employees at the mall gains them access to the mall after closing . marcus hides somewhere , then jumps out of hiding as the last security guard arms the alarm and walks out of the mall . marcus jumps out and disarms the alarm before it can arm completely -lrb- thus eliminating the annoying need for a code or password -rrb- , and he then lets willie in from where he has been waiting somewhere outside . the two proceed to rob the mall blind . thus enters the premise which allows room for the comedic content , if you can call it that , of the film . willie 's an alcoholic who apparently survives the rest of the year on the money that he steals from one mall after another on his nationwide bad santa sprees . since he makes all of his money from stealing from the malls , it 's not hard to see that he 's not going to really enjoy being surrounded by slobbering kids all day since he is not interested in the hourly wage in the first place . thus follows lots of groan-inducing streams of profanity sprayed at unsuspecting kids and their equally unsuspecting parents . now , the profanity is one thing . it got real old real quick , but it 's still , as they say , just one thing . then you have the fact that willie is constantly falling over drunk , smashing empty booze bottles against fancy suvs in the parking lot on his way into the mall , and a whole array of other hideous infractions of basic decency . when i think about the character of willie from this movie , i 'm reminded of melvin udall from as good as it gets whose communication with the world , as roger ebert noted , was ` limited to insults intended to harm . ' but jack nicholson provided a charm to the character that i believe billy bob could also have provided willie , had this ridiculous script called for it even in the most distant way . i 'm also reminded of billy from buffalo ' 66 , another hideously unattractive and straight-forwardly mean person who displayed the social skills i expect must have been common sometime around the cretaceous period , but billy was an ugly person in a movie that was also deliberately ugly . it was a compilation of cinematic skill that made buffalo '66 -lrb- and billy -rrb- look and act the way did . bad santa is ugly and mean because the humor is simply bad . if i were to summarize , i would just say that if you are entertained by seeing an aging drunk screaming streams of profanity at a preteen boy for a hundred and thirty five minutes , then please watch this movie , you are sure to enjoy it . personally , i think that there are some things that simply have no place in modern mainstream entertainment . mostly all of them can be found conveniently compiled in the scary movies -lrb- which collectively play like a ` what not to do ' list for aspiring filmmakers -rrb- , but there are plenty more examples found here in bad santa . while i did n't hate the movie , i ca n't help automatic feelings of surprise and disbelief whenever i hear anyone say that they enjoyed it , even on a basal level . the movie is so callous and so ugly and so uncomfortable that even the good elements , like the fact that willie supposedly is ` changed ' for the better -lrb- really , could he possibly have been changed for the worse ? -rrb- by the little boy who inexplicably falls in love with him , are not enough to counter the intense ugliness of the character of willie himself . ugly movies can be successful and impressive -lrb- epitomized most recently , i think , in the case of buffalo ' 66 -rrb- , but violence , alcohol , extensive criminal activities , and mass quantities of profanity mixed with the almost constant presence of young children is the absolute extent to which an ugly film can go horribly , horribly wrong . personally , i always find it a little bit sad that filmmakers think that modern american audiences would be entertained by something like this . even more than that , i find it sad that , a lot of times , they 're right .		3		0
in india , one of the top bollywood super stars khan -- amir khan is making a movie . we hear that he is very choosy , selective and does lots of discussion with the director of the movie before saying yes . so when he said yes to act in a movie everyone got interested and we knew that he is re-making a tamil version of a movie called ghajini in hindi for national release . while reading the story of ghajini , i remembered that this story is something i have seen . i thought for a while and realized that during one of my international flights i saw a movie -lrb- and felt asleep half way -rrb- with same story line . so researching on the web -- i found that the story on which ghajini is made is memento . that is when i decided to give memento another shot , determined not to sleep this time during the viewing . the story is about a man leonard -lrb- guy pearce -rrb- whose wife -lrb- jorja fox -rrb- is killed and due to the fight with the killer teddy -lrb- joe pantoliano -rrb- , leonard looses his short term memory . leonard remembers every event till his wife was alive , but after that his memory captures only events for 12 seconds maximum . to remember that he has to take revenge for his wife 's murder -- he has tattooed all over his body the events and facts , and he keeps taking photographs and writes lots of paper notes to remember what he has to do , where he has go etc. . that is the way leonard takes the revenge and kills his wife 's killer . it is a typical revenge story . what makes people interested are two things -- the concept of 12 seconds memory thrown in and the story is told backwards by the director christopher ; meaning the movie starts with the killing of the murderer , and it goes backwards to the scene when wife was killed . this i think is the unique selling point of the movie . the director must have really spent a huge amount of time and energy in scripting this unique concept . why one should say the story backwards is a question i still am not able to figure out . for what purpose and sake -- just for experimentation , just to show that yes a story can be told in this fashion too ? i suppose yes . earlier we have seen many movies of the same genre where the episodes are juggled and presented to the audience , and only through the last episode the real mystery is uncovered . but does director christopher succeed in this experiment ? yes -- in getting audience interested in the concept , and yes in getting nominated for oscars for best scripts and editing . as i told earlier -- during the first viewing i fell asleep , because i could not make head or tail of this movie . my second viewing , i forced myself to see it through the 113 minutes . i saw it . as the movie is presented in reverse , i viewed the movie twice in reverse to get hold of the story better . i must have spent about 250 minutes viewing this movie again and again from all possible ways . my verdict is the movie is badly made because : the director even though experiments with a new concept , but fails to hold interest of the audience . all the actors have acted with stoned faced expressions . the love scenes between guy pearce and carrie anne moss -lrb- another woman natalie -- who helps him -rrb- are too irritating , distracting , clichéd and unnecessary for the flow of the movie . the direction -- apart from the reverse presentation is very poor . the biggest flaw is that it thinks that the audience is stupid and fool . i could not understand when this hero is not able to remember anything more than 12 seconds how come he figures out that he has kept the notes and photographs in his pockets ? every time he pulls them out -- how his memory works then ? the story seems to be said lasting two days in total , during which time -- he solves the mystery and kills the murderer . what happened between the accident and that two days ? how many days have gone by ? i saw the movie backwards too . the precision with which he solves the mystery and leads up to the killer is so simple and like child 's play -- one thing leading to another . the director says that the police do n't believe in the hero analysis and thus have not helped him . the efficiency and confidence with which the hero analyzes and corrects his notes is laughable . how he knows what he wrote earlier was false , just because someone has just said the opposite ? could be the person who just gave him the facts -- must be telling lies . no questions asked -- just a big gimmick by the director christopher -- who wants to prove a point that he too can make an intelligent movie . but according to me he has failed miserably . i would like to give this movie a zero rating out of 10 just to bring it out of the number 28 slot on imdb database , but because of this unique concept and attempt i have to give him ... -lrb- stars 3 out of 10 -rrb-		3		0
at least with `` ginger snaps '' -lrb- 2000 -rrb- it had some underlined metaphor for puberty , but this ? if there were some hidden agenda for female then , sadly or quite rightly , i missed it here . what promised to be an interesting story has only turned out to be a film with more caps attached , to cover its dreadful ham-fisted delivery , than an a-lister at a photojournalist convention . there were comic tensions to be seen , but the timing was all out of place , it just seemed `` so wrong '' , wrong in the sense that it falls flat , continually , and this is trying too hard and failing miserably , hearing that pin drop never relieved the embarrassment of a poorly executed film . with such an interesting concept this has been glossed over as a comedy , sadly , the only comic relief here is the fact that these inserts seem to be wanting to be taken seriously . being fully aware of the predicament that our young protagonist , dawn -lrb- jess weixler , born 1981 -rrb- , is under and her determination to save her most sacred moment , this does at least have its moments too . we see these young adults trying hard not to give into temptation , and with this chosen life style , we see them sullen and with great restraints comes great responsibility and pressure , all due respect and fair enough . the gap between serious overtones of ones belief and the way in which it is handled is wide . a seriously funny film or a funny film of serious consequence ? yes , we have the wanting and the lustful thoughts of these everyday kids shown before us , but to choose the method in which this cross-over from child to adult has been a wasted opportunity . attempting to extract a laugh , except for a cringe , never came , yes , a dog that eats a man severed member is funny , is amusing and `` ouch '' comes to mind , fair play . sadly , though , this is no deep cavity of either horror or comedy . gross-out and tacky is all we get for our money , this film was not done in the private sector but with a state handout , and with a state handout , it 's harder to go and ask for your money back , but easier to see why you did n't want to go in the first place .		3		0
when i was a kid i used to love the spice girls , so seeing this film was pretty obvious . i still love them , but now only for their songs , because this is a pretty terrible film . it is basically just seeing the spice girls , victoria as posh spice , melanie brown as scary spice , emma bunton as baby spice , melanie chisholm as sporty spice and geri halliwell as ginger spice , spoofing themselves both fitting what they are like off camera and their nickname personalities . the film is mainly them touring and meeting fans , with some ridiculous moments in between , e.g. some silly daydream sequences , meeting aliens , witnessing a birth , and a bomb on their bus . also starring richard e. grant as clifford , sir roger moore as the chief , michael barrymore as mr. step , richard briers as bishop , elvis costello , alan cumming as piers , the dream boys , the voice of neil fox , stephen fry as judge , sir bob geldof , jools holland , bob hoskins , barry humphries -lrb- aka dame edna everage -rrb- as kevin , sir elton john , hugh laurie as poirot , meat loaf as dennis , the rocky horror picture show 's richard o'brien as damien , lee evans : so what now 's steve o'donnell as jess , the witches ' bill paterson as brian , jonathan ross , jennifer saunders , simon shepherd as doctor and peter . all the great spice girls songs appear , including `` wannabe '' , `` stop '' , `` spice up your life '' , `` too much '' , `` saturday night divas '' , `` never give up on the good times '' , `` do it '' , `` say you 'll be there '' , `` 2 become 1 '' , `` mama '' , `` who do you think you are '' and `` viva forever '' -lrb- the only good reason to see the film -rrb- , but that does n't mean the film is n't bad , what was simon fuller -lrb- their manager -rrb- trying to do to them -lrb- ? -rrb- , all five girls even won -lrb- quite deserved for acting -rrb- worst actress awards at the razzies . the spice girls were number 32 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons . adequate !		3		0
renny 's directed a few movies i have loved a lot , even some of his flops , but this is maybe the worst one of his i have seen . what could one expect with a talentless wrestler or whatever john cena is . the movie is about a cop who takes down a bad guy and has a casualty and the bad guy promises to get his revenge . he seeks his revenge a year later by teasing him with twelve rounds of a game of cat and mouse . it 's been done in many movies such as die hard with a vengeance . so yea you 're not seeing anything new here . i consider this movie lower than a b-movie myself , although i am sure it had a respectable budget . it is chocked full of explosions and car chases and the like , but the plot is super dry and dull . i was thinking it could have worked as a tv show and maybe been better , something like 24 . the end of the movie had a sloppy directed and edited outcome . it was filmed horribly in fact , i was wondering what the hell was renny thinking at times with his choice of angels and such . cena is a bad actor , i do n't know who he is but hes a sports figure or something that should 've stayed with that and not dipped his toe in the waters as an actor . he reminded me of a buffer , older paul walker and we all know how much he sucks ... i hated the way the black partner was portrayed in this one too . white film makers always portray african americans in the same cliché way in these movies and its insulting . i have to say it does move fast and entertain though , the plot is flawed like crazy , its often shot badly , the acting is beyond crap , but it is watchable if you like action films . i will never watch it again , nor would i recommend it . i give it 3 stars because it is an action movie and it had a lot of action and was worth a viewing . i did n't complain or was n't wishing for it to end , i was at least entertained enough to set through it .		3		0
my title ought to be enough . it baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence -lrb- dumas , flaubert , balzac , maupassant -rrb- would churn out such tosh as the `` nouvelle vague '' cinematic movement . until the 20th century , france had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and clever philosophy . but the minute you hand them a movie camera they start acting like look how weird i can be ! plot ? theme ? ! let 's film an amusement park ride going round & round ! at least this is not as bad as godard -lrb- who has an unhealthy fascination with the backs of peoples ' heads . , quel artiste . -rrb- . no , truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity . but so does the security camera at a . the two are indistinguishable . haha , just as an aside to all you dweeby film school nerds : i bet the vein is popping out the side of your neck right now . but do n't leave without reading the last sentence of my review . anyway , if you like french literature , you will hate this . people who like this movie probably have never read any books other than the ramblings of jack kerouac or maybe `` hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy '' . or maybe they have read the lyrics to the doors songs , and they think that 's profoundly moving . whatever floats yer boat . i find it ironic that this film injects some -lrb- weak -rrb- allusions to balzac , one of the finest and most meaningful writers who ever lived . nice try , truffles . but you 're nowhere near the ballpark . avoid this film like an syringe . if you 're the type of person who likes to think , then stick to jean cocteau -lrb- orphee -rrb- , robert bresson -lrb- pickpocket -rrb- and the japanese masters kurosawa -lrb- -rrb- , kobayashi -lrb- kaidan -rrb- and teshigahara -lrb- suna no onna -rrb- . if you 're an idiot , enjoy your truffaut , godard , and andy . and for pete 's sake push that vein back in your neck . you look like a cabbage .		3		0
`` the dream child '' of 1989 is the fifth film in the -lrb- generally overrated -rrb- `` nightmare '' series , and at the latest from this point on , the series became total garbage . the only good films in the series were wes craven 's 1984 original , and the third part , `` the dream warriors '' of 1987 . the second part was disappointing and boring , and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman freddy krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes . this fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for -lrb- admittedly great -rrb- visuals , and one creepy scene , a flashback sequence to how freddy krueger came into existence . the rest of the film consists mainly of our yelling stupid one-liners , and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses , who desperately try to avoid falling asleep , because good old freddy awaits them in their dreams . lisa wilcox is back in the role of alice johnson , and a bunch of uninteresting crap , such as a ` eerie ' children 's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel ... in short : no originality , just a decline of the old formula , and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes . my -lrb- generous -rrb- rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals , and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel , `` freddy 's dead '' , which is awful beyond belief . in case you 're not a hardcore freddy krueger enthusiast , `` the dream child '' should be avoided , and even if you are , this is more than likely to disappoint .		3		0
this is just one of those movies that continually make you groan and that i wished was over . the problems are many and the good points are few . i feel the main problem with this movie is that it has what amounts to a cheesy plot and they try to make it out to be a epic movie , which a movie about super evil monkeys and smart ones that sign just is not epic , it is cheese . when you have cheese you make the movie more fun . granted , the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and more of things of that nature was needed . instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the movie just has a corny plot amid all the serious tension the movie is trying to set up . the plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex-husband while also searching for some sort of legendary diamonds . she uses these two guys who trained an ape to do sign language and now wish to return her to the wild as cover to get into the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime . the only things that make this movie somewhat tolerable is ernie hudson 's character and the laser attack at the end .		3		0
-lrb- i 'm going to discus the `` twist '' so if you do n't want to know skip this and move on -rrb- will smith gives an excellent performance in one of the most maudlin and wtf unnerving movies of the year . the film begins with smith calling 911 and asking for an ambulance because some one has committed suicide . when the operator asks who it is , smith says its himself . the movie then flashes back in a disjointed manner to tell the story of what happened to put him in the hotel bath tub filled with ice . the long and the short of it is that sometime before smith had caused an accident while texting and driving that killed seven people . in order to make up for it smith has decided to find seven deserving people and give them his organs . yes this is a happy movie that makes you wonder what was hollywood thinking . to be honest i 'm not opposed to the basic plot line being used , i 'm more opposed to the way the story is told . they jumble the story to keep the fact that smith dies a `` secret '' . they then show smith as he tries to pick the people he will help and deals with his is n't fully revealed until his final moments . its bravo for smith as its clear he 's got great acting chops . as for the director and writer i have to ask what were you thinking ? you 've created a film that is almost completely depressing and terribly illogical . if nothing else why would anyone put up with the bullying and brow beating that smith directs toward some people . i 'd have told both him and his horse where to go . what really bothers me is that because of how the film is constructed the air of death hangs over the entire film . its another sub genre of the death porn franchise . ! i could go on -lrb- i never mentioned the clichés yet -rrb- but i wo n't . needless to say this is not a favorite film for me . i 'm sure this is destined for hollywood infamy as a film of some -lrb- ill -rrb- repute . -lrb- hey as they say the best camp films are the ones that are n't made intentionally campy but end up playing that way . -rrb- between three and four out of ten because of will smith 's performance .		3		0
andy kaufman may have been a funny guy , but this movie is a bomb . jim carrey is not good as kaufman , but andy would have said . . '' ï do n't care '' . the movie has so many flaws i really do n't know where to start . mr. kaufman was an `` avante guard '' comedian , which is like saying ... it is kind of art house and you `` get '' it or you do n't . his flaky style of substituting himself with another character was funny ... if you saw it once . but andy used this over and over . he was in the sit-com taxi , and if there was one thing kaufman did have it was confidence in his own material . -lrb- he did n't see his weaknesses -rrb- . the best thing one can say about kaufman -- is that he was highly original . the movie is one long tedious bore , and carrey does nothing to lift the sinking film . if this was kaufmans highlights , i am glad they never showed the low parts of his life . it appears he was vastly over-rated .		3		0
so this is one that i have heard about in the past , but have never gotten around to watching . but since i own it on one of those 50 movie packs , i thought i 'd see what it was all about . and of course , it is a really horrible movie , but it falls into that so-bad-it 's - good class , and is actually quite entertaining . spoilers follow ... a ship 's captain -lrb- james best -rrb- arrives at an island inhabited by a scientist -lrb- baruch lumet -rrb- , his daughter -lrb- ingrid goude -rrb- and his assistants -lrb- ken curtis , gordon mclendon , and alfred desoto -rrb- who are working on experiments designed to shrink the size of the human being to help alleviate overpopulation and its consequential demand on natural resources . however , in this quest , they have accidentally created giant mutated monster shrews . unfortunately , these have escaped from captivity because jerry farrell -lrb- ken curtis -rrb- got drunk and left the cage door open . now the group is barricaded in their home , surrounded by several hundred of these beasts who eat 2-3 times their body weight each day and are quickly running out of food . the situation is complicated by a hurricane which makes it impossible to leave immediately . as things progress , the shrews predictably and progressively attack their livestock , the ship 's crew and finally the group themselves , with resulting mayhem , death and destruction . this is not a good movie , but it is a very unintentionally funny one , and it does not take itself too seriously . the script is corny , the acting is wooden -lrb- and in places , it feels like the actors are actually reading from the script -rrb- , there is little character development , and the plot is predictable . the side romance love triangle and jealousies just add to the fun of this picture . i laughed out loud each time the `` killer '' shrews were shown from a distance , as they looked like friendly little puppy dogs wearing some kind of fur coat . and some of the dialog just cracked me up . -lrb- for example : captain sherman , on finding remnants of his crew mate 's clothes , states `` they do n't leave much , do they ? '' , or after the death of mario by poison from the shrew 's teeth , radford baines states -lrb- and i paraphrase -rrb- how wonderful that the shrews have assimilated the poison , pauses , apologizes and says that he always looks at things from too clinical a perspective -rrb- . i did enjoy this one , and will likely watch it again . it is funny , easy to follow and never boring . despite its many flaws , i am sure it will have a fan base for the foreseeable future . `` dr. milo craigis : in 24 hours there will be one shrew left on the island , and he will be dead of starvation . an excellent example of overpopulation . thorne sherman : you know something doctor ? dr. milo craigis : what 's that ? thorne sherman : i 'm not going to worry about overpopulation just yet -lrb- kisses ann , fade out -rrb- ''		3		0
i 'm hardly the audience for tree of life . i enjoy some of the art-house films but ca n't call myself a big fan or an expert . have n't seen many terrence malick films . i have only seen one third of thin red line before i turned it off . i heard that badlands was good but i have n't got the time to see it . but i can call myself a patient viewer who expects something good out of a film with brad pitt and sean penn in it . i so as you might have guessed , i did n't like tree of life . for it was a tho and a half hours of pretty images blended with poetic , pretentious lines and brad pitt acting . there are two good things in tree of life . the cinematography by emmanuel lubezki and brad pitt 's performance . the film is shot beautifully and with great love , providing this film an otherworldly atmosphere . the rest was just pointless , `` poetic '' dialog with detestable main character , annoying mother character played by even more obnoxious jessica chastain . she joins the elite club of actresses that sink good films : emma stone , juliette lewis , kristen stewart , angelina jolie and jessica alba to name a few . also i found tree of life very clueless and and without any clear goal or intentions . yes it somewhat explored childhood and looked at the family but it lacked anything meaningful to say and what it did say was just wrong . i wo n't go into any specifics because i hardly care about this art-house garbage . the tree of life is only worthwhile if you are a terrence fan or a film critic . general audience should stay away from this film unless you are really into art-house cinema .		3		0
the big red one strikes me as a realistic view of the war , but what it lacks is a coherent goal . it seems just like a slice of life of the soldiers who travel from place to place , enduring conflict and battle . i will say that it is a success for its depiction for war , but it is n't a success in any other way . touching and emotional are some of the scenes - like the break in the battle when they visit the civilians and when , at the end , the jewish boy is finally given some food and dies in the soldier 's arm at the end of the war . unless you are really interested in world war 2 and war movies in general , i would not recommend this film .		3		0
superman iii is not considered to be the worst of the superman films but now that i 've seen superman iii and the abomination that is superman iv , i can happily say that superman iii is simply far worse than superman iv which is by no means a good film apart from the fact that it has a few good factors to it such as the returning cast , the character of superman and the superman like moments and the overall short duration of the film that ensures us that this film is n't as horrid and stinky as superman iii superman agrees to stop the launch and use of nuclear weapons and begins to put an end to it but by a complete accident , he creates a man of nuclear referred to as nuclearman whose one task is to kill superman , under orders from a returned lex luthor . superman is an iconic movie character , respected and even worshipped by some and often labelled the greatest superhero ever made and one of the all time great movie characters . thanks to christopher reeve and richard donner , superman is a worshipped character from the magic of the first two superman films which portrayed him as an honest , courageous , courteous , brave and determined fighter whereas superman iii did n't really take the character anywhere and explore his sudden evil side . whilst potential , terrible overuse of slapstick humor and a horrendous story destroyed the film to a point beyond repair . thankfully , superman iv got two things perfectly right about the film and that is the character of superman and how is loyalty to metropolis as well as reeves ' portrayal who absolutely nails it once more ! it was almost a joy to see everything about superman recovering since superman iii and this is quite simply , the only good aspect of the film i 've never criticized special effects in films and normally , i do n't intend to . when you consider how great the effects in the first three superman films are and how superman ii had a budget of over 50 million and that the latest instalment , which was produced seven years later , has less than $ 25 million , it is so definitely clear that this film was not to ever be made considering the box office and critical failure of superman iii . the effects in this film look beyond horrendous , even unwatchable especially sequences involving superman or nuclearman flying through space or metropolis . it looks like a terribly edited version on photoshop where nothing looks realistic enough to take seriously . sequences involving flying around in metropolis , especially a scene that ruins superman in two ways involving superman taking lois for yet another fly around metropolis is not only hard to take seriously , it completely destroys the magical moment from the first film and makes superman a rather hard character to understand . i guess it 's time to get used to him in superman returns but thankfully , this is the only instance where superman is portrayed as a douche . having taken her for a tour , he gives her a mind erasing kiss -lrb- which still makes no sense -rrb- in order for her to forget that he is superman . simply , the special effects looked horrendous . even monty python and the holy grail , being a 1975 picture , had better effects of god ! whilst christopher reeve is outstanding as superman and gene hackman is as usual , good as lex luthor , the rest of the cast simply are n't interesting even marc as lois lane , who simply does n't show the same enthusiasm and passion as she did in the first two . clearly a bad sign ! the acting comes off rather horrendous especially the voice of nuclearman done by hackman , who completely makes it truly ridiculous to take seriously . the new characters in this film are n't interesting . the entire story evolving around the daily planet is simply stupid and how the story unfolds there is completely ridiculous and to top it off , more and more annoying and one dimensional superman characters are introduced . even lux luthor himself is uninteresting throughout the film and nuclearman is a complete waste of some potential . the story , whilst having potential , simply does n't turn out to be anything special or even remotely , interesting . much of the film is simply boring and thankfully , clichéd slapstick is not thrown into the film to make it worse ! it definitely has a superman feel to it and in some ways , had some great sequences such as the scene involving kal-el 's kryptonian ancestors where they warn him to stay away from human affairs . however , this scene is completely betrayed later in the film and much of the individual scenes taking place in the film are completely unnecessary and are rip offs from the first two films . overall , in some ways i can not understand how loathed this film is yet superman iii is allowed a free pass . it just shocks me to see how this film is the most hated of them all but honestly , whilst a terrible film is made to be a great film when watching immediately after superman iii . a lack of stupid slapstick and a computer villain make this a better film than its predecessor but still not a good film by any means .		3		0
`` you 'll recoil and shudder as you witness the slaughter and mutilation of nubile young girls - in a weird and horrendous ancient rite ! '' does n't the tagline say it all ? considered to be the first ever film , `` blood feast '' from herschell gordon lewis - the ` godfather of gore ' as his following has coined him - does n't fail in what it sets out to do , and that 's to create a complete gore-fest with many a hacked off limbs and gory murders . all well and good , but it just does n't work , or pull it off , when it is atrociously made , poorly written , and the acting is below terrible . a cult film by today 's standards , my general take on the reception of this is that people who enjoy it are simply just enjoying the camp feeling , and tipping their hats off to what really was a fine achievement for 1963 , as some of the scenes in this are pretty stomach-turning and well done . limbs are hacked off with a machete , a tongue is cut out of a woman 's mouth , there 's a decapitation and lots lots more , including a pretty nasty flogging scene which i 'm sure did n't go down too well with the censors back in ' 63 . a series of brutal murders and mutilations have a town in the grips of fear - especially it 's womenfolk , who are vehemently encouraged to not step outside their doors alone after dark . the obvious pattern to the murders , the police in charge of the investigation - detective thornton and captain frank - are completely baffled and do n't have a notion whatsoever as to where to even start looking . the murders are being carried out by a psychopath with bushy eyebrows who takes the body parts into a cellar below his shop where he is creating a blood feast to honour some ancient egyptian god . conveniently , since his shop deals in all oddball accessories such as ancient food from times , he has been hired to organise a special party for a young woman who is obsessed with the ancient gods of egypt and is studying them in college . conveniently yet again ... she is dating thornton . but will he solve this oh-so difficult case in time before his woman ends up being the next victim of the ... blood feast ? filmed in less than ten days on a budget reportedly as low as $ 25,000 -lrb- i guess that would buy you a lot of red paint and fresh meat from the local butchers -rrb- , and although it certainly did break a lot of taboos , and established a landmark in horror - which it can not be denied - it 's still a pretty bad film , and despite its very modest length of 67 minutes , it 's very boring and feels so much longer . why i think this is so popular amongst a certain branch of horror fans , is because it 's gore effects still hold up reasonably well today , and it is really unintentionally funny and a guilty pleasure for some i 'm sure , to watch . however , i do not fit with this branch , because i just found this to be almost unbearable to watch at times , and had it not been for the brilliant gore and special effects , i would have given this a burnt-out rating of 1 . it does n't even achieve a decent atmosphere - it 's really all just hacking and screaming and watching some of the most stupid characters running around on screen . the first movie to ever be just labelled and advertised for it 's violence , i think its no surprise that the violence is all that can be credited ; the acting is possibly the worst acting you 'll ever see on screen -lrb- and i 've seen the works of ed wood , and the god-awful `` the beast of yucca flats '' -rrb- . the majority of the time , the actors are completely ott , and the best example of that is in the scene with the boyfriend being comforted by the useless detective thornton and captain frank . this pair were the predecessors to dumb and dumber , here 's a fine example of their expertise , this one when they finally realise that the feast going on at thornton 's girlfriend 's house is n't what it appears to be - `` call the , fast ! and for pete 's sake , do n't let them eat anything ! '' what really got me was that thornton attends an seminar with his girlfriend , where the lecturer is conveniently discussing the very god that the psycho killer is worshipping , detailing exactly what a certain lunatic would do to pay tribute to this god , yet thornton fails to see the connection , and just sits back grinning like a damn fool when the answers are right in front of him ! it all builds up to a hilarious ending with the dumb cops chasing and shooting at the killer . unsurprisingly , this made it onto the list of 72 video nasties outlawed by the bbfc , and being made in 1963 , it has the honour of being the oldest film to make it onto that infamous list . well , unlike many of the other movies on that list , i can see why this made it onto it . gorehounds , fans of the bizarre and occult , and just extreme movie buffs like myself , will be compelled to track this down and watch it , and i 'm sure i wo n't be the only one who ends up laughing all through or finds themselves counting down the minutes . `` blood feast '' is one artifact that should remain buried .		3		0
the incredible hulk is a film with a lot of `` non-stop '' action sequences and decent special effects , but is there really much more to it than that ? my answer would be a simple `` no . '' it is nothing more than a typical summer action movie . iron man was amazing with an awesome storyline , brilliant acting , awesome special effects and bad ass action sequences . seeing this film after iron man was destined to leave me disappointed . i had heard so many good things about it that i was let down . i 'm just gon na come out and say that i thoroughly enjoyed the 2003 version of the hulk as i thought it had a really good storyline and a very good vision . i liked the whole artsy feel . take out the art , add the film adaptations of the fantastic 4 , only with the hulk and you have this movie . it 's fun but there 's nothing else to it . the only things that really keep me from rating it lower are the acting which was phenomenal and the ending which i thought was pretty good . other than that , it 's just mindless fun . do n't go into this film expecting another iron man and you should be okay . it 's a fun summer , popcorn movie , nothing else !		3		0

ah , the joy of straight-to-video movies . i really can not believe anyone could get any enjoyment out of the hangman 's daughter . a gratuitous concoction of tacky sex , graphic violence and juvenile gore , it homages day of the dead and the exorcist but wholly without charm . maybe the only thing stopping dusk till dawn 3 being such a bad film is the fact that it 's slightly superior to the abysmal dusk till dawn 2 : texas blood money -lrb- 2 -rrb- , surely one of the worst films of all time . no , hangman 's daughter is slightly the better due to the fact that p.j. pesce is a better director than scott spiegel , and álvaro rodríguez is a better writer than scott spiegel & duane whitaker . but only just , and , as i say , there 's not much in it . frights in this movie are produced not through genuine terror but through loud musical crescendos that crash in over the action at appropriate moments to make the viewer literally jump out of their seat . there may be some people that believe they 've just been scared , most of the audience will realise it 's more akin to being deafened . acting - save for , perhaps , temuera morrison as the hangman - is strictly third rate , and when you 've got to the end of this excessive , mess of a movie you feel the urge to take a shower to wash away it 's effects . hangman 's daughter , then , is a `` 3 '' , though it 's perhaps not helpful that the original movie which spawned it was not a classic either . from dusk till dawn -lrb- 6 -rrb- was a script which quentin tarantino adapted from a treatment by bob kurtzman and john esposito in 1990 . completed as a favour for just $ 1500 , it was blown up to a $ 17 million feature when friend robert rodriguez became attached as director and quentin agreed to . there are nice turns from harvey keitel and george clooney , and it does recall similar elements in natural born killers -lrb- the beginning , at least -rrb- , though it 's ultimately a throwaway movie . if you were going to make a trilogy based around a tarantino movie , then this would probably be your last choice . but , goodness knows why , dusk till dawn 's sequels are now taking up space in supermarket `` bargain bins '' the whole length of the country . i do despair the things quentin willingly attaches his name to , almost , it seems , without thought . at a time when he 's only had two truly great movies - and two lesser ones - to his name , being attached with lacking projects means the good-bad ratio of his output is becoming extremely strained . generally , quentin 's writing skills can not be faulted , coming in to such great demand that they earnt him $ 1 million uncredited dialogue rewrites on the enjoyable crimson tide -lrb- 6 -rrb- and the rock -lrb- 6 -rrb- . less successful was the apocryphal four rooms -lrb- 3 -rrb- , and then there 's the acting . since jackie brown in 1997 , the only things quentin 's been associated with are executive producer credits and acting . it 's been reported that quentin sees himself as an actor first and foremost , an unfortunate view that detracts from his writing . he is passable in reservoir dogs , where his small role is kept in the background , as he debates madonna and his name of , sounding like a film nerd younger version of woody allen . however , constructing a whole film around himself , as with from dusk till dawn -lrb- 6 -rrb- is a mistake . quentin is an excellent writer , a fantastic director , and , if i must be honest , not really very good as an actor . for great , see orson welles , or even woody himself . but quentin should stick to the bit parts , or concentrate on his writing . so where next for quentin ? does his career still have legs or has a promising talent already shot his bolt ? certainly , i think he should branch out to avoid being pigeonholed . science fiction films , maybe ? possibly , though it 'll be hard to fit a scene with the boot of a car into a sf movie . yet the coming year will see only his fourth feature as writer/director emerge , 40 lashes . i hope that this will be a return to form for quentin , as he has achieved far greater things than being executive producer of this lame movie in the past . though that 's another story . the time ...		3		0
please do not think for a moment that i feel `` save the last dance '' is some cinematic epitome of greatness , because it is n't . what is it , however , is a film that was pretty useless all around , but had enough good `` stuff '' in it to make it very entertaining . `` step up '' not only lacked all that `` stuff , '' but the dancing was horrible too ! last time i checked , if a movie is going to be about dance , the dancing part should be impressive , no ? i am not one to diss films for being formulaic or overly contrived , as i love many movies which are just that , but if you are not going to add anything new to a medium , it should at least be done well . this film is almost like a terrible remake of `` save the last dance '' gone wrong . the story was completely ridiculous , if not totally implausible . the dance sequences were boring and uninspired , like a bad week on `` so you think you can dance . '' even the music was predominantly made up of really horrible , generic rnb . they hit on way too many clichés -lrb- including black man with gun , non-understanding parent , mom -rrb- and not once in this film would anyone begin to care about these stupid people so when there is the obligatory dramatic death of a young one , all it does is make you roll your eyes at how mundane every aspect of this movie is . even the editing was terrible with so many bad cuts and continuity problems , i wondered if the director was even awake sometimes . channing tatum stars and i was hoping to see him show some acting chops , but all he did was prove he can play a white boy wannabe really ... badly . and he 's not that great of a dancer . there is no doubt that the model is gorgeous , but even that was n't enough to really make this movie worth sitting through . if he is going to have any future , he 's going to have to stop appearing in crap films like this and `` she 's the man , '' learn to act and not think that his perfectly sculpted face is going to get him anything more than a few more fluffy film roles until he fades away and regrets giving up modeling .		3		0
by the fifth installment , new ideas were in short supply for this once towering franchise . michael comes back -lrb- again -rrb- . ok , this guy has been stabbed a lot , shot numerous times , french fried in fires , crushed by boulders , blown up , run over by cars and trucks , fallen from heights , flushed down toilets , been forced to watch tom cruise marathons , and so on . and he 's always back for more . yet dopey cops and vigilantes try to fight him ; hello there ; he 's kind of indestructible you guys . like a bogey man creature . that makes money for movie producers every time he shows up . you might have trouble killing him , you know ? i know , i 'm wasting my breath . horror movie extras are dumb . and suicidal . so he still wants to croak his sister . and anybody that 's anywhere near her . or if they 're cops . or if they 're teens who forever laugh about him . or a couple on a date that say stupid stuff . any of that sound familiar ? he robotically saunters around a town that everybody probably would have moved out of by now if they had any brain power . but nobody does , especially whoever concocted this mess . mikey still has his trusty knife , and does n't say much . sometimes he likes to stand there a while before killing somebody . sometimes he does a jump scare murder to wake you up . if you just want to see blood spraying around , there 's plenty of that . at all times , the acting makes the kills almost seem merciful to the audience . there 's a pitiful attempt to showcase michael 's world , and that goes predictably nowhere . nothing new , just endless horror movie clichés . michael is currently hunting down the people responsible for this movie .		3		0
naive blonde gets drunk with notorious lothario , staggers home with him , fights him off with a fire poker , passes out , and runs away without her shoes . before fleeing , she neglects to check if he 's dead , alive , or anything in-between . he 's found slain the next day so she just assumes she 's a killer . we have to slog through some highly improbable plot twists to get to the truth . i quickly tired of the trio of look-alikes at the center of this tale . their dialog is strained and cutesy , as if to foreshadow sitcoms . ann baxter 's sweet and virginal persona , and the wisecracks of ann sothern , grated . baxter and richard conte giggling over how to eat a burger ? i guess they were invented in the fifties , but gim me a break -- did anyone buy into their attraction for each other ? not even the eponymous nat king cole song helped much . if there is any doubt , i did n't like this !		3		0
after having seen numerous deaths , dozens of decapitations , dozens of dismembered body parts , impalings and gallons of blood spewing from bodies with the aid of cgi , my jaw dropped with anguish . this is the kind of anguish you get when you 've lost hope in something that tries so hard to be grand . do the makers of `` 300 '' understand anything about ` subtlety ' , and the effectiveness of when to show constraint on jarring violence and bloodshed ? i could care less if this is adapted from a comic source , from a another story and loosely based on some historic fact . this movie in no way represents anything that is plausible , realistic or even thoughtful . we have a bunch of shakespearean actors clad in skimpy warrior clothing fighting , blurting idiot dialogue , and behaving like brain-washed . this film is somehow capitalizing on the popularity of the technical waves of movie making in the post 2000 era . but if that is not all , it 's shrouding itself in a form of pretentiousness whilst pouring on the visual effects , combining unrealistic carnage and relentlessly showing non-stop war . the music is also execrable . what this film achieves in technical merit fails in character development , story , and believable acting . you know this story is threadbare when it has to be narrated 60 % of the time . the narrator 's voice proves annoying after 90 minutes and the meaning of his dialogue should be presented to 3rd graders listening to a library oration . it 's real stupid . i highly doubt any of the costumes were authentic . i took a class in historical costumes in college and these garments resembled something more suited for a gay costume party . butler plays his king big , by ranting and raving with his histrionics . this is a good talent that was put to waste in such a moronic movie . all the other actors are weak and one-dimensional which just adds to the poor storyline . my biggest peeve is that there are people who are stupid enough to believe this is respectable and dignified art , when in reality it 's nothing more than a violent cartoon espousing virtues of killing , war and murder . in an age where we have attained a heightened sense of moral balance , this film ideologically takes us back to a primitive state . it 's frighteningly preposterous , because it takes itself so seriously , you have to wince at it 's heavy-handed boldness . it tirelessly expels its convictions without letting up . there is nothing humorous or lighthearted about `` 300 '' . i think this movie relied solely on hype and a showy marketing trailer . as the king of sparta leads his 300 spartan best on a revolt against the persian armies , we see how a cartoonist illustrates a very fantastic and overblown depiction of how wars were fought . the result is that the battle scenes are redundant with far too many slow motion sequences . none of this looks remotely realistic . the result is that everyone and everything looks ridiculous . 300 borrows shamelessly from other movies such as braveheart , lord of the rings , hunchback of notre dame , sin city , gladiator , too name a few . but that is what 300 is , a ripoff . it 's a completely plagiaristic attempt to scatter every major box-office hit into one two-hour hodgepodge of a flick . i would be merciful to this disaster if it had humor , sensuality , or likable characters . unfortunately it does not contain few redeeming qualities other than its blatant impudence to ripoff an unsuspecting public .		3		0
a thriller must be logical all the way down the line . it has to be very well-thought out from a writers standpoint . if the early scenes are referenced later in the movie , they must be treated logically . if peoples ' lives are on the line , as an audience member you realize that their main purpose in the movie is to move that plot along , that they are devices for the writer , not actually people in the best possible sense . in this way , the movie got it fairly right . no one on that bus is anything more than a stereotyped stock character , taken from many an irwin allen disasterous background . the villian should be colorful , have a variety of snide remarks with which to arm himself against the hero , and have a bone to pick with humanity as a whole . the hero should have at least one expression other than anger , and the leading lady , if there is room for one in the budget , should be asking the illogical questions most of the audience wants an answer to . it should all add up at the end , it should be accountable to itself . this is not that movie although it got some things right . bullock was not yet a star so had little to lose by just being herself . keanu is so one-note that he looks constipated . casting dennis hopper as a villian is as original as casting meg ryan as a new yorker with a laptop and a haircut , who has a lot to give the right guy . unfortunately , jeff daniels , glenn plummer and joe morton , previously thought to respect their craft , are along for the ride , too . one question - how did the bus still run after the gas tank was punctured ? just curious . i have two dozen similar questions , but need an answer to that one first . if that has a decent answer , then maybe its just me alone that expects it all to make some sense . 3/10 .		3		0
nine months is about an expectant couple . to borrow a tagline from a jeff goldblum movie : be afraid . be very afraid . if the inanity does n't kill you , the stupidity will . nine months opens with samuel and rebecca -lrb- hugh grant and julianne moore -rrb- on a beach , assessing their , samuel deciding he is happy , rebecca intimating she is dissatisfied . -lrb- so what 's new ? she 's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with `` dissatisfied .

'' and he left out the part about his baby being a maggot . when rebecca falls pregnant , she tells samuel she gets a kick out of `` something living inside her . '' -lrb- was she talking about samuel 's english pinewood during intercourse ? maybe she should talk to geena davis during that dream sequence birth . -rrb- for the record , girly , nothing is `` living inside you '' - your baby is a part of your metabolism . it is you until it is birthed . if you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism , think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi . got tapeworm ? why not a gerbil ? message comes through loud and stupid : pregnant mothers are the best people in the world . the expectant father is always wrong . and getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy . and the sworn monster bachelor ca n't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with `` breasts like , calves like and crazy about sex , '' because bachelors are men and men are pigs . and though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the earth , though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing , though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology , whenever a women plops out an infant human being , it is somehow always - a miracle . and then there 's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant , she has to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth , because heaven forfend if they 're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-christ or a maggot or something ... give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she 'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again .		3		0
french connection ii is one of those sequels that should never have been made , like the exorcist ii and the two matrix sequels . it is absolutely abysmal as william hackman -lrb- minus partner roy scheider from the original -rrb- chases around france , pursuing a drug dealer -lrb- fernando rey -rrb- . here 's the problem : director john frankenheimer , god bless him , is no william friedkin , director of the original , and gene hackman without scheider is simply not that interesting here . also , the film appears to have been largely shot with no sound , with sound effects and large gobs of dialog added in post-production . and worse of all , even though this may have been an american production , it was shot in france with a european cast except for hackman and ed lauter . if you think ronin suffered for being a euro flick disguised as an american flick , with one american star -lrb- deniro -rrb- , you have n't lived until you 've seen this . i saw this in the theater when it was first released and could n't believe my eyes and ears . it was essentially a `` silent film '' minus the usual american production values . the action sequences go on too long and use the same gunshot ricochet sound effect about 200 times , and the prolonged chase at the end goes on so long , you will wish hackman 's character had suffered a heart attack and died along the way . he almost does , his longish but thinning hair flopping all over the place . also , and i hate to say this , but rey , at the time an aging european star little known here , is not terribly convincing as a drug lord . without a good villain , where are you ?		3		0
i thought space jam was a good idea for a film , mixing animation with live action , especially looney tunes . unfortunately this sequel from director joe dante -lrb- gremlins -rrb- is the most corny and hardly funny animated and live action film i have probably ever seen . basically brendan fraser as dj drake dreams of having an adventure and being a professional stuntman , then he discovers with help from bugs bunny and daffy duck -lrb- both joe alaskey -rrb- that his dad , damien drake -lrb- timothy dalton -rrb- is a spy -lrb- obviously -rrb- . he also discovers that the chairman -lrb- steve martin -rrb- plans to do something evil . the only really funny bit i remember is the bit where bugs , daffy and elmer fudd run through that melting clocks painting , and they melt , like the picture . also , it is nice to see some favourite looney tunes/merrie melodies characters , but it is still a very corny and not very good sequel to space jam . daffy duck was number 50 , looney tunes/merrie melodies number number 20 and bugs bunny number 10 on the 100 greatest cartoons . adequate !		3		0
a big friendly saint bernard gets rabies and begins to turn into a vicious killer . this only makes life even more difficult for some local people who are already facing problems with their families , job , etc. . . this is a pretty boring movie . there is no way around that . the development is slow and not much really happens . in fact this is more of a domestic drama with a slight horror element , than just a horror film . the book was pretty much the same , but at least the book had many more details and far better , if also slow , development of what is going on . the pain and discomfort of the characters was displayed so much more effectively that you actually care to a degree what happens , but not here . the visceral element is also all but totally gone here with hardly a drop of gore . then to top to all off , the director adds in a touchy feeling ending , which is essentially the opposite of what happened in the book , and that makes the film sink below what is even mediocre . the screen adaptation of ` pet sematary ' was far superior and the book was even better . 3/10 rated r for some violence		3		0
shutter is another disappointing horror remake from director masayuki ochiai who does a decent job with this film but the lack of real scares , suspense , and an original ghost is what weighed down the film the most . the cast for the most part are okay in their roles but nothing memorable including joshua jackson , rachel taylor , and john in a brief extended appearance . this film was really lacking inventive scares , suspense , and a scary villain who seemed to be just a rip off all the other vengeful woman ghosts who can be found in many other horror movies out there . the eventual surprise dealing with one of the characters i sort of saw coming and the ending was n't the greatest either but then again when do most horror films have a happy ending . there was a little suspense but no real scares fortunately they kept this movie to a trim 85 minutes but after watching it you still feel like that was a total waste of time . overall shutter has an interesting premise but little suspense , no real scares , originality -lrb- villain wise -rrb- , and it does n't offer anything new or exciting to the genre . even the cast who put in an effort ca n't save shutter from joining the long line of disappointing re-makes coming out these days . if they amped up the suspense , scares , and a more original villain the film shutter would 've been that bad but it ended up being a disappointment .		3		0
rather than listen to the desperate pleas of millions of star wars fans worldwide , george lucas ploughs ahead with attack of the clones in precisely the same manner that made the phantom menace a disappointment of star destroyer proportions : there 's even more boring political subterfuge , even more dreadful cgi , even more ridiculous ott action sequences -lrb- worst bits being obi wan and anakin in pursuit of an assassin and the very silly droid factory sequence -rrb- , and even more bloody jar jar binks !! and if all that does n't make you want to hurl yourself into the nearest available pit in a fit of despair , then the badly written , poorly acted , sappy burgeoning romance between anakin skywalker and padmé amidala will probably do the trick . about the only things that lucas does right are to cast hayden christensen as the now-grown up anakin , because his lousy acting perfectly complements the wooden performance given by jake lloyd in tpm , and to get natalie portman out of those bloody stupid queen outfits and into something a little sexier -- i 'm not particularly a fan of ms. portman , finding her to be ` classically pretty ' rather than smoking hot , but i have to admit that she does look rather delicious in her tight white outfit with impossibly toned midriff on display .		3		0
this is a very odd , sort of sick movie . a group of teenagers ends up on an island , run be a psychopathic hunter who is bored with animals and hunts humans instead . since `` the most dangerous game , '' this tired old plot has played out many times . even the original `` star trek '' did an episode like this . that said , how do you make it work . first of all , we have all these goons running around the island , working for the boss . they probably would have had numerous chances to bump the jerk off at some point . they are obviously violent men . instead , they do his bidding . maybe they are n't so smart . they giggle and drool most of the time . meanwhile , even after the plot is hatched by the big guy , the people to be hunted are allowed to get together and figure out what they are going to do . there are also people being skinned in the basement and mounted in some kind of trophy cave . there is a woman floating in big aquarium . what is the motivation for this guy . even general zaroff in the original had a code he lived by . he was willing to face the possibility that he would be killed . in this one , one of the hunted is given a gun , but when he tries to use it , there is no firing pin . it stumbles on to its idiotic conclusion -lrb- suddenly one of the guys ca n't be stopped by bullets ; where did that come from -rrb- . it does n't work under any sort of scrutiny .		3		0
who else wanted to hold penny 's computer book for just one moment in our lives ? was i the only one hoping to one day catch a glimpse of dr. claw 's face ? if you are chanting `` yes . yes . yes '' along with me , then you are already aware of my feelings with disney 's debacle of a feature film presentation . now , this is n't to say that there were n't elements that i found entertaining -lrb- gosh , am i saying this ... -rrb- , but overall this seemed to forget the foundation that it was built upon -- even the perverse cameo at the end sent shivers up my spine . where did the creators go wrong ? let 's begin by saying that this was a concept , a cartoon , that disney had no right placing their expensive hands into . i was hooked at the beginning surprisingly . why ? i wanted to see the birth of gadget and the reason why claw and him were always pitted against each other . i wanted to see the creation of good and evil , but after twenty minutes , i saw disney do what they do best . matthew broderick nervously steps into a role that he obviously was n't ready for . he plays gadget himself , a bumbling security cop who dreams of being a police officer . due to rupert everett 's whining and obvious lack of knowledge of who dr. claw is , the two find themselves crossing each others paths at a lab where a new form of artificial intelligence is being designed . there is a pretty -lrb- played by joely fisher -rrb- whom john brown -lrb- broderick , -rrb- pines for , but can not win because he does n't have the confidence to win her over . well , we all know where this is headed next , and disney lays it on thick as broderick uses every torturous gadget in his disposal to eliminate ... not dr. claw , but a clone that is demolishing the city ... can he win ? i ca n't give it away , though it would make you better film viewers if i just blurted the ending ... who would pay money for this plastic form of entertainment . alright , characters -- there was no commentary on this film , so i only watched it once -lrb- thankfully ! -rrb- , but broderick was the obvious stand out . he tried , i know i feel bad saying this , but he did try to bring some depth to this character . gadget is a bumbling idiot -- but he has a good heart . i thought broderick was a good choice personality wise , but he never took gadget to that next cinematic level . i wanted to have the foundation of the cartoon , but then grow into a feature film that had heart and dedication . in this mere 78 minute short film , there was nothing . so , on one side we have gadget -lrb- broderick doing his best -rrb- , then on the other side we have the worst hollywood idea ever -- rupert everett as dr. claw . this was a hazard . this was disney thinking they could take a enormously popular villain and give him a soul . this was rupert needing to ham it up more than broderick so that there was a share of the screen . there was no evil , there was no corruption , there was nothing that even faintly resembled the `` claw '' that we grew up with . the henchman seemed more in tune than everett . he was n't funny , he was n't sinister , he was n't diabolical in any way . he was fluff , and that was n't the dr. claw that i attempted to pay money to see . his portrayal was a disgrace to anyone that has ever even glanced at the cartoon . arg , it makes me mad just to mention it in this review . rupert everett ruined dr. claw . penny -lrb- michelle trachtenberg -rrb- seemed to follow the everett style of `` '' , but not following her character at all . should n't there have been a prerequisite to see the cartoon prior to making the film . oh , filmmakers , how i shun thee . i guess if one could literally pull themselves away from the hideous acting by everett , the rest of the film just seemed raced and pushed . i was happy to see that it only lasted 78 minutes , and they did cover quite a bit of ground , but it just felt like they were n't willing to give the credit due to the cartoon . this was a cult cartoon , and to see disney play for a younger audience , care nothing for the pre-existing older audience that grew up with gadget , make jokes that seemed cliché , and bubble the bad guy . it was hard to watch . i was pleased with the script , the director tried to go dark with a really random broderick attempting to play a darker , more fun character as gadget 's clone -- but overall this film just lacked the spunk from the cartoon . i wanted animation , i wanted excitement , i wanted an adventure that would befuddle adams himself , but instead i had a story that seemed like it would be in the dollar bin within the week of its release . overall , this film was n't horrid . the story itself was n't anything i could watch again , but their ability to not overextend the plot , made it for simple viewing . it was 78 minutes of filming that i did n't mind , but could n't get myself to watch it again . i will forever hate everett for what he did to dr. claw , i think dr. claw will forever hate everett as well . his portrayal ruined this film . it knocked it to the ground with no opportunity to pick it up again . broderick was watchable , but i do n't think he was what this film needed . `` inspector gadget '' is a perfect example of what happens when disney puts their hands into a project and is determined to ensure that children get laughs from physical humor . this was a sad attempt of a film , but a part of me is happy that i watched it -- now the cartoon seems better than ever ! grade : ** out of *****		3		0
i had heard a couple of people tell me that this film was rubbish , so naturally i wanted to see it for myself , and boy did i agree with the opinions . it is n't the absolute worst film i 've seen for a while , but it certainly is n't good enough to see again . anyway , basically years ago miners opened up a long buried dragon , and as the years pass , earth has become an incinerated wasteland with who ever 's left alive doing everything they can to survive , and find a way to kill the fire breathing beasts . leader of a northumberland medieval castle is quinn abercromby -lrb- american psycho 's christian bale -rrb- , and his whole group of survivors , including friend creedy -lrb- 300 's gerard butler -rrb- , are hoping the dragons will die out and go into hibernation , but their running out of food . one day , american dragon slayers arrive , led by denton van zan -lrb- edtv 's matthew mcconaughey -rrb- , with pilot alex jensen -lrb- goldeneye 's izabella scorupco -rrb- , and they are all now working together to bring down the beasts . that 's about it ! also starring scott james as jared wilke , david kennedy as eddie stax , alexander siddig as ajay , ned dennehy as barlow , rory keenan as devon , terence maynard as gideon and alice krige as karen abercromby . the special effects are worth looking at , but the performances are all woody -lrb- not just from mcconaughy -rrb- , the story is lame , well , it 's just a lame film . adequate !		3		0
imagine dodgeball , one of the funniest movies in the past five years , then imagine it done again , but with the sport changed , some different actors in it , and make it not as funny . yes ladies and gentlemen that was blades of glory , now imagine some stupid film producer sitting there and taking blades of glory and repeating the process , that unfortunately is balls of fury . a movie that is not a tenth as funny as it thinks it is and so unoriginal it makes your eyeballs scream in agony as you watch it ! balls of fury unfortunately was the first movie i saw of 2008 , hopefully i just made a poor choice and this is not a reflection of the quality of movies i will see throughout the rest of the year ! anyway balls of fury is a limp fish of a comedy with a couple of funny set pieces and christopher walken on delicious over the top form . but the majority of the film is just very poor slapstick , the lead actor , dan fogler , acting like a prat , and he really is the most annoying actor i have seen in quite some time , and just some jokes that aim for funny but end up being more irritating than anything else . the jokes range from very average to pretty much hateful , i mean how many jokes can you make about a blind person walking into things ? according to this movie a lot more than you could ever hope to imagine . my other big problem with this is the fact the first half hour is n't even remotely funny , at least the middle and final act seem to be trying , the first act just seems pitiful , in fact the first act rivals epic movie in terms of badness ! so let me get onto the performances . firstly there is dan fogler , now i find adam sandler an annoying actor , but nothing could prepare me for how hateful i would find fogler . the last movie i saw him in was good luck chuck , which i forgot he was in though looking back on it i hated him that as well . well in this movie he seems like a very poor man 's jack black , with not a millionth of the charisma nor the comedic timing . the script does n't help fogler , but personally i think that only thing that could make him less annoying is perhaps a or perhaps a bullet ! maggie q plays his love interest , yes unfortunately you read that right . maggi q has been decent enough in mission impossible 3 and die hard 4 , but here she is so bland and lifeless . plus you can almost see that she does n't want to be in this movie , despite fogler 's annoyingness he at least looks like he 's enjoying himself , maggie q just seems half asleep . and the pairs romance is never , ever believable ! so its down to christopher walken as the chief villain , feng to steal the movie , as he always does . walken seems to be having a blast , and he delivers some killer lines . but i was more confused by him being in the movie than anything else , he 's a great talent , so why is he wasting his time in this rubbish ? anyway he has the best lines and the movie at least makes you a bit more alert whenever he is on screen . a shame then that the final ping pong match involving him is pretty poorly done . george lopez is pretty poor as the fbi agent along for the ride and to be honest lopez even seems aware his character is n't funny . my biggest problem with balls of fury is the fact it just is n't very funny . while the movie is honourable in the fact it keeps references to genitalia to a minimum , surprising given the tag line and title , the movie instead relies on heavy slapstick and poor fart jokes . fogler is hit in some way at least one hundred times in this movie , not once is it funny , not even worthy of a slight smirk . the movie also relies too much on the blind master bumping into things , or perhaps in the most misjudged joke of the past year , him having a sex with a man thinking its a woman , a scene that aims for hilarity but seems closer to cruel . thankfully the script is funnier when walken arrives , or at least he makes things such as `` hurry up , we 're missing the antiques road show ! '' a bit funnier than they would be when said by a lesser talent . the movies fight scenes are admittedly above average , but they only really arrive towards the end when the movie is already too stuck in the mud its stuck itself in to be rescued . the movie also has no originality , the strange sport idea has been obviously taken from dodgeball , and the movie aims to be a funny enter the dragon when it so obviously is anything but funny . so unfortunately balls of fury is a very poor comedy enlivened by one actor . in fact had walken not signed on this would head for 1/10 territory and stand firmly alongside epic movie . thankfully with him , and perhaps the mad german ping pong champion , the movie has a tiny bit of life in it . still this is n't worth a recommendation , more a warning . and be very afraid everyone if fogler ever hits it big , because i swear to god i am going to avoid every movie he is in for a long time after this performance !		3		0
`` ice age '' out of all the 3d animation franchises boasts the least intriguing characters . where madagascar is saved by the militant penguins and king julien , or shrek by a certain talking donkeys and a host of fairy tales , `` ice age '' has to fall back on scrat , who unfortunately has grown stale and repetitive with every new outing . `` ice age : dawn of the dinosaurs '' manages to recapture some spirit through scrat 's love affair and the introduction of the swash-buckling weasel buck . manny , diego and co offer limited appeal , mostly functioning as dramatic outlets for plot development , leaving only sid to be a somewhat colourful , if goofy character . this time around scrat is back to his quest for the and acorn , while buck makes a appearance . as manny -lrb- ray romano -rrb- tries to control her hormonally challenged daughter peaches -lrb- keke palmer -rrb- , the earth starts another epic change when continents split . as a consequence peaches and ellie -lrb- queen latifah -rrb- are split from manny , who finds himself adrift in full ocean with the sabretooth diego -lrb- denis leary -rrb- , sid -lrb- john leguizamo -rrb- and the latter 's granny -lrb- wanda sykes -rrb- . manny will do anything to return to his family , but in order to do so he must first confront the first sea pirate on earth : prehistoric ape captain gutt -lrb- peter dinklage -rrb- and his crew of misfits . despite some new characters like granny and the inclusion of extremely talented dinklage , unfortunately the story did n't work for me and the excess of characters meant none were really focused on , as each of them compete for stage time . overly contrived and lacking pace or charm this lazy instalment of `` ice age '' drifts along waiting for end credits , cold in delivery , despite best attempts to warm up the audience -lrb- mostly through pretty standard laurel and hardy type jokes -rrb- . ultimately a sequel too much for what was already a strained idea . by far the least successful of the series , showing that this franchise should be heading for meltdown . hopefully no more global events await the `` ice age '' , thus no further stories to be painfully churned out .		3		0
i love action flicks , even the big macho one 's . sometimes you just have to have a senseless violent action flick to escape reality . i was kind of looking forward to `` under siege '' . i 've never seen a film . but seriously this was just way way way too predictable , which a lot of macho flicks are , but at least they have some comedy or fun action sequences to it . first off , the girl who played miss july , goes from a stupid naked blonde bimbo to a rambo street smart strong woman ? uh huh . then siegal , he tries his comedy jokes , but they were too dry . and the villain , tommy does good , but he 's not too convincing of a bad guy . over all , i just thought that this was beyond predictable and not that enjoyable . it just copied off of die hard , only at sea . this is one action flick i would not really recommend . 3/10		3		0
i did n't really care for this movie . it was n't entertaining enough ; nothing more than a silly video game . some how this guy , sam , goes into a video game -lrb- which i still do n't understand how he got there -rrb- to find his father , kevin . it seems many years ago , kevin invented this video game world and got trapped there . clu is the alter ego version of kevin and he oversees the games . the games use motorcycles and frisbees that are used to defeat the opponents . the opponents shatter when hit because they are n't real . some girl whom was supposed to be special some how rescues sam and takes him to his real father . from there , sam devises a plan to escape through a portal . final verdict : it was too confusing for me . there are many better sci-fi movies then this : do n't waste your time .		3		0
just go with it vacation destinations offer free services for children because screaming brats encourage alcohol consumption . amazingly , it 's not the kids that are in this comedy , but their chaperons . after he gets caught in a lie about being married , dr. danny -lrb- adam sandler -rrb- convinces his office assistant katherine -lrb- jennifer aniston -rrb- to portray his soon-to-be ex-wife in order to woe a woman , palmer -lrb- brooklyn decker -rrb- . matters worsen when palmer insists on accompanying danny , katherine and their two children on their last family trip to hawaii . their fake marriage is further tested when katherine runs into her old rival devlin -lrb- nicole kidman -rrb- at the resort . this interpretation of the original stage play is a mockery of comedy : the jokes are pap , the plot is completely predictable and the point is evasive . besides , why take your mistress on your family vacation , when you could just as easily rent a fluent whore when you get there ? -lrb- red light -rrb-		3		0
-lrb- -lrb- -lrb- -lrb- -lrb- spoilers -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- i do n't think that i have made an effort to like or , at least , respect any movie more than i have alfred hitchcock 's vertigo . i have seen it maybe half a dozen times on the big and small screens , read reviews and analyses of it , as well as essays about it in a couple of hitchcock biographies . i recognize just how it fits into hitchcock 's filmography and how it details his notorious obsessions . it is an important film as far as the study of hitchcock is concerned . but , in the end , vertigo is just not a very good movie . i do n't see why it is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time ; indeed , i would n't even place it in hitchcock 's top twenty . instead of appreciating it more each time i view it , i find myself resenting the way it distracts from hitchcock 's better efforts . the premise -- basically a variation of `` frankenstein '' by way of a dark and brooding `` my fair lady '' -- involves a man 's attempt to reshape a woman into the image of a woman he thought he loved and lost , not realizing they are the same woman . the concept is intriguing in theory , but largely unbelievable in execution . the film is told in two halves , the first being a detective story . it involves the type of ludicrously contrived murder scheme that only works in old self-mocking whodunits -lrb- '' ` you see , ' explained nick to nora , in between sips of his martini , ` gavin had to use scottie as his patsy , because a man who was not deathly afraid of heights might have climbed to the top of the bell tower and discovered ... ' '' -rrb- you get the idea . almost like a trial run for the far superior psycho , hitchcock concocts a convoluted thriller storyline which ultimately only serves as a set up for the psychological drama in the second half . this may be the only aspect of the film that shows hitchcock 's genius : using a far-fetched mystery narrative as a way of luring the viewer into the murkier melodrama that is the real center of the story . but , it seems hitchcock was so fascinated in elements of the latter part of the story that he was n't concerned with the plot holes and dubious logic that make the first half largely unbelievable . and , unfortunately , part two is hopelessly entangled in the clumsy web spun in part one . it is part two of the story that also fascinates the film 's admirers -lrb- who tend to ignore or forgive the sloppy set up of part one -rrb- . having established that james stewart as scottie , has fallen in love with kim novak 's madeline , only to see her apparently commit suicide , the film introduces judy , also novak , who is a dead ringer for madeline . on meeting judy , one would think that a trained detective like scottie would immediately be suspicious and begin to investigate her past , instead he starts playing henry higgins and begins training judy to again look and act like `` madeline . '' judy , who should realize that scottie can implicate her in a murder , plays along , presumably because she has fallen madly in love with scottie . but basically , no one does anything logical in this film , everybody being hopeless enslaved by the rather silly plot , rather than by obsessive love or psychological turmoil . the film just does n't stand up to close scrutiny , either dramatically or psychologically . okay , films , especially hitchcock 's , are less about plot than style . but even so , the film is substandard , especially for a hitchcock film . there are a few clever shots and striking images , but that is overshadowed by slow pacing , a very hokey dream sequence and stilted dialogue . and there are some odd choices involving the use of color that prove particularly annoying . at first , i thought the muddy , muted look of the film was the result of badly aged prints , but seeing the restored version proves this not to be the case . and for some reason , jimmy stewart 's face seems bright orange in every print of the film i have seen . the look of the film is so annoying , that the last time i watched it , i turned the color off on my tv set . the film actually plays better in black and white , reflecting its pulp film noir elements . it seems that the reason the film 's reputation has skyrocketed over the years has less to do with hitchcock 's skill at making it , than that vertigo represents a convenient checklist of all his phobias , fetishes and obsessive visions . those who have laboriously defended the film seem to skim over the gaping holes in its logic , dwelling on the film 's paper-thin psychology : the film 's protagonist scottie representing hitchcock and his not-so healthy desire to control and abuse women of a certain type . okay , maybe that is so . but a psychological profile is not necessarily the same as a work of art -- or even passable entertainment . hitchcock may -- or may not -- be revealing his psyche more in this film than in any other he ever made , which makes it for discussion of his entire career , but that does n't mean vertigo stands up on its own . rather than representing the epitome of what the name hitchcock stands for , vertigo should represent some sort of embarrassment . the story is poorly plotted and poorly told . novak and bel geddes give solid performances , but stewart is just terrible in the central role ; it just may be is worst screen performance . and hitchcock 's stylistic touches seem self-consciously obvious , detracting form the drama rather than underscoring it . but , as a dress rehearsal for what he would soon accomplish , vertigo works decently enough . the red herring first act , the unexpected death of the leading lady , the psychologically scarred protagonist with necrophilic leanings -lrb- played by an actor with an established boy-next-door image -rrb- , the denial of a one woman 's death by creating the illusion she exists in another person 's body ; these are all elements that would rise again in psycho , hitchcock 's true masterpiece . psycho realizes the vision that vertigo only promises .		3		0
the trailers for pleasantville were compulsive . this was going to be big hit material - clever cinematics , nineties know-how trashing fifties , but old-fashioned feel good triumphing in the end . well , yes and no . initial reviews in the uk were lukewarm , certainly not scathing , but two weeks after opening and in the aftermath of the what 's ` it awards , i had to travel outside the temples , where life is suddenly beautiful and shakespeare is in omnipresent love , in order to find a screening . it really was n't worth it . the visual jokes - you know , single beds , perfect sports players , milk everywhere - made me smile , as no doubt thirty minutes of the tv series would have done , but the dark undertones of book burning and racial segregation did n't sit well . and as for joan allen 's sexual awakening in the bath ! the bergman school of comedy all of a sudden ? luckily i had recorded coronation street to come home to . back to reality .		3		0
shooter -lrb- 2007 -rrb- review : i have always wondered about wahlberg . can he be a leading man ? who knows . this is his next attempt . shooter is not what many have given it . this was said to be an action , action , and action movie . this is not . this is more of a drama with some action in the middle of it all . wahlberg has gotten better at acting , but this is underwhelming to say the least . the plot is rather weak . they spend to much time talking about the evil of the bad guys and lose focus on the action and drags along ... a lot . there are some exquisite sniper action sequences here and there and are satisfying . the action is here , but not as much as you may think . this movie became frustrating as hell as i continued to wonder when will this pick up ? that 's what were dealing with . this reminds me of another wahlberg flick , `` the corrupter '' , that had promise , but little action and to much drama that can choke a horse . the difference is that `` shooter '' has a little more action . the action sequences are well done , but are so few and far between . there are far too many obvious plot holes here and a predictable ending . i was not too fond of the anti-american stuff either . just hideous . at least one thing is for sure is that the locations and scenery are eye candy . from many beautiful locations across america are breathtaking ... not to mention the babe kate mara is nice . the last word : terrible . i would not even recommend saving this for a rental . do n't expect a thrill ride . this is not an action movie .		3		0
what an incredibly bad movie . this could be tom hanks ' worst movie . everything aspect about the story was contrived . tom hanks ' performance was contrived . the whole premise of the movie was contrived . the idea of anyone being stuck at an airport and then living there is completely implausible ; no way could that happen . literary license can stretch just so far and in this movie it went way beyond what the rubber band can bear . every character in this movie was uninteresting , most uninteresting being the played by tom hanks . his character has to be one of the dumbest hollywood contrivances in cinematic history . the character is part stupid , part clueless , part hapless and completely unlikable . this movie should have been over the moment his application for a visa was denied . that itself would have been a red flag for airport personnel . that tom hanks ' gives a sloppy performance can be forgiven . after all , he was working with substandard material . but that a production company actually felt this was a movie worth making is sad . people get stuck at airports all the time ; it 's one of the drawbacks of traveling . planes are late , delays occur , bad weather , unanticipated events , but no one ever actually lives in an airport , no matter how egregious the situation , except a man named victor in a movie called the terminal .		3		0
another winner from director jane campion . she was the one who gave us `` the piano '' in 1993 . this `` in the cut '' is equally bad . painfully slow moving , this tells the story of a promiscuous writing teacher who lives near a recently committed murder and begins an affair with a police officer , mark ruffalo , who is investigating the killing . she begins to suspect ruffalo as the killer . she meets with her half-sister and in a scene totally unrelated to this bomb of a film , recounts to her how her father got dumped on a skating rink by his fiancée and immediately proposed to another . this is totally off the wall . then one of her students is arrested for the killing . her own half-sister winds up dead , and then eventually we realize that ryan has made a mistake in thinking that ruffalo is the killer . who the real killer is is no surprise . the only surprising thing here is how bad this film really is .		3		0
this overstated hodge-podge of debauchery is neither fascinating nor entertaining . like director baz luhrmann 's earlier romeo and juliet , this one leans very heavily on style . and when one leans heavily on something with little substance , one falls firmly on one 's face . which is what this unfortunate movie does . it tries hard not to be dull and boring , and in doing so eschews any semblance of nuance . everyone and everything in this movie is loud , boisterous , screaming to be heard about the maddening din . sure , this might be 1900 paris , but if it was , i bet they had a run on the following morning - if there ever were following mornings . i do n't doubt people were as debaucherous as this ; they surely are now in some circles . a naive young writer -lrb- ewan macgregor -rrb- enters the world of the artists in paris at the turn of the 20th century and quickly falls in love with an alluring chanteuse -lrb- nicole kidman -rrb- . that 's great . a love story is fine . but sadly , macgregor and kidman have less romantic chemistry than a can a tuna and an angry kitty cat . each is a respectable thespian in his or her own right , but such talent is completely overwhelmed by the roar of the madness . kidman can be very effective in much quieter roles , such as dead calm , malice , and to die for , but really most anyone could have played this particular role -lrb- provided they were tall and had 7-foot legs -rrb- . macgregor 's been in some good films , both small -lrb- trainspotting -rrb- and large -lrb- star wars episode 1 -rrb- . both would have been much better off passing up on this junk . the original was an inspired musical featuring some fine tunes . this one is a mish mash of pop hits from the 1970s to the present , often sung at inopportune , inexplicable times -lrb- and sometimes not even in the song 's entirety -rrb- . there 's plenty of visual goings-on , however , for the viewer to forget the music sucks . admittedly , the cinematography is superb , eliciting images upon images ; there really is some magician behind the camera for this one . but rather than being a masterpiece in and of itself , the camera artwork merely overwhelms everything else about the movie . if i wanted to do nothing but see compelling images , i 'd go to an art house and gaze at monet for a few hours . or , in the case of this flop , peter max or perhaps early andy warhol .		3		0
i was trying to watch the movie as though it was still 1988 , my childhood years even , but i still did n't like it . the blob was just soooo corny . i think the only thing cornier would be the attack of the killer tomatos . i mean , who thought a gelatinous mass of red goo would be a credible monster . when i think of a good horror movie i think , `` will thoughts of this monster keep me awake at night ? '' and after having thought that , the answer was a resounding `` no ! '' . the blob would n't even make a cameo appearance in my mildly unpleasant dreams . i 'm just not frightened by the idea of my cherry jello eating me or dissolving me . apparently this was a remake of a 1958 film with the same title . maybe in 1958 there was a story going around of a kid whose chewed up bubble gum came alive and ate him so the movie had some type of credibility . but in 1988 , after having seen nightmare on elm street , halloween , friday the 13th , the exorcist , poltergeist , and a host of other scary movies , the blob just does n't belong .		3		0
a gruff governess has been fired , yet again , and has no job and nowhere to live . the agency refuses to help her anymore , but she steals a piece of paper off the desk of her old boss for a governess position and heads on over . seems the young woman who called was asking for a social secretary and got herself a nanny instead . -lrb- ditz alert . -rrb- but this was just what the ditz needed . someone with wisdom and insight to make the `` brat '' see the light . basically it 's a nice story and mcdormand does a good job at an english accent and being a proper , religious and english woman . adams just got on my nerves , as she has been lately in her last few movies -lrb- that i have seen -rrb- . but what gets me is that more and more movies spoken in english i have had to click on the subtitles as i can not understand a lot of the dialogue -lrb- sexy beast for example -rrb- . either the actors are mumbling , which is occurring more and more , talking too fast -lrb- adams is a champ regarding this one -rrb- , there is too much background noise -lrb- music , special f/x -rrb- , or the actors talk too softly . i do not think english-speaking people should be required to have english subtitles for what is being said -lrb- for hearing impaired as well -rrb- when they watch a movie in their own language . maybe this is just a peeve of mine . it kind of ruins the movie for me . but what ruins this movie is adams and her flitting about , talking a mile a minute -lrb- yes , i know it was the trait of the character -rrb- , but after a few minutes of it one just gets worn out trying to keep up and we want more of the real story and not some bimbo who needs a lesson on life . die-hard adams fans will love it though .		3		0
i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together , the talk is not of the master 's great films like `` north by northwest '' or `` strangers on a train '' , but a lesser-known effort like this one from 1931 , obscure and seriously flawed , which showcases the great director in fledgling form . emily and fred hill -lrb- joan barry and harry kendall -rrb- are a middle-class london couple scrimping to stay ahead . he begrudges their lot ; she accepts it . change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle , saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . they make plans for a world cruise . but their problems have only begun . just ask richard hannay , roger o. thornhill , or marion crane . well , marion 's indisposed at the moment , but you get the idea . travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight , setting one up for a perilous journey at best . this is perhaps hitchcock 's earliest foray into this theme , and not his most successful or memorable . hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element , in this case domestic drama rather than suspense , but the two do not cohere , at least not here . the hills are a dull , flat couple , with no chemistry or personality . when they find themselves at the folies bergère , in the form of cross-cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film , they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers . `` the curtain 's gone up too soon ! '' gasps emily . `` they are n't dressed . '' when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise , it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing , even if the people they partner off with are drips , too . emily 's man , gordon -lrb- percy marmont -rrb- carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs , which he suggests be filled by emily . fred 's girl `` the princess '' -lrb- betty amann -rrb- has clara bow 's eyes and wallace beery 's five o'clock shadow . there 's also an obnoxious fellow passenger , a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . subtlety was still to come . everything is shot in an abrupt manner , with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that does n't come off , and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears . when fred and emily break off , they are seen being jostled on a pair of rickshaws , one of many clunky attempts at symbolism . emily 's the only vaguely sympathetic character , in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon , but mostly because she 's among the first of hitchcock 's many magnetic blondes , her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film 's conclusion . matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set-piece for the protagonists to come to grips with , and presumably repair their relationship . only they are n't active participants in the resolution , and except for the fate of a friendly cat , nothing about the ending resonates . at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s , and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food . `` rich and strange '' is hitchcock paying his dues , and learning his trade , one for scholars but not casual film goers .		3		0
as a story premise , the witches of eastwick held enormous promise - after all , who better to play the devil than jack nicholson , and when backed by such respected and charismatic actresses as michelle pfieffer , susan sarandon and a well renowned pop star such as cher playing a trio of seductive witches , how could it possibly turn out as anything less than a wonderfully witty comedic success ? upon viewing the film , it 's hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong , but by the end , it 's very easy to see the result for what it is - a hackneyed and ill conceived mishmash attempt at a romantic comedy thriller which ends up being neither romantic , comedic nor thrilling in any way whatsoever . while the movie boasted an excellent premise , it took screenwriter michael cristofer and happy feet director george miller to mangle their source material , managing to turn an intriguing story into a patronising , imbalanced and out of control mess . the film ranges from dull and yawningly predictable to just plain surreal , never once managing to draw the audience in in the least , apart from certain moments of utter bewilderment . but if the shoddy helming was n't enough , the film also inputs some bad early attempts at cgi , -lrb- most memorably a ` devilish transformation ' which would have been far more effective if it were simply implied , devil 's advocate , rather than garishly thrust on screen -rrb- which lose the film even further credibility . even john william 's score , which would normally be a high point of such a film , is far too over-dramatic to fit the tone , and simply seems out of place . it 's hard to decide if the film 's central weakness comes from the seeming indecisiveness as to whether to turn the film into a horror epic or romantic comedy , or simply shoddy directing and writing - either way , the result is excruciating to behold . it is tragic indeed to see such a tremendously capable cast put to such waste . jack nicholson is a master at playing sly and devious , imposing and dramatic , and witty and humorous , all without breaking a sweat . the role calls for all of these qualities , but he achieves none ; resulting in an overly goofy and unconvincing performance , complete with a cringe-worthy and immensely distracting hairstyle . cher is simply a deplorable casting choice , seeming constantly flat and emotionless , and never once convincing in her role . susan sarandon and michelle pfieffer -lrb- especially the latter -rrb- try their best , but their characters are so poorly written that they are given little of interest to do except undergo painfully contrived seduction attempts by nicholson 's character . both are capable of far superior work , and they appear to know it . the supporting cast almost unanimously overact to the point of hysteria , only adding to the viewer 's overall feeling of disdain . all in all , the witches of eastwick may have started out as a clever idea and a superb cast , but ultimately the film falls short on essentially all fronts , mainly due to the shoddy , uninspired directing and weak , imbalanced script . it is truly tragic to see the legendary nicholson reduced to such a level of mediocrity -lrb- though tiny traces of enjoyment can be obtained from him time to time , overall he is still a colossal disappointment -rrb- and sadly enough even the highly talented pfieffer and sarandon also fall short of their true potential . all parties involved are capable of far superior work , and it 's highly disappointing to see such a talented array ending up with a film as poor as this . -3 / 10		3		0
after wrong turn 2 single-handedly told me that direct to dvd horror sequels could be very good , i decided to give this one a try . my renewed enthusiasm was quickly diminished . i had hopes for return to house on haunted hill , but i was a fool for being optimistic , as this cardboard cliché-ridden sad excuse for a haunted house movie was awful for all the wrong reasons . the story , be that what it may , revolves around ariel wolfe , the sister of the girl survivor from the first film , being informed of her death , and going to the house on haunted hill under duress when shes taken by some thugs who are looking for a statue in same said house . tediously dull the film soon becomes a chore to sit through as there 's no chills , no tension , and virtually no excitement whatsoever . sure a copy gory kills are scattered here and there , but even they are lacking . the hd-dvd version has an option to choose alternative paths for the characters to take -lrb- a la final destination 3 -rrb- which in theory is kind of cool , but quite frankly i only could make it through two choices until i grew bored again . skip this film . my grade : d eye candy : oksana goes full frontal , provides the t & a ; and gets topless after the end credits		3		0
decent animation and some workable character development keep this animated horse fable from dreamworks at least watchable ... however it remains somewhat slow paced and the storyline is a bit on the silly side . . it is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and indian roles , but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision . grade : c		3		0
beyond reanimator is a boring , obviously cheaply made follow-up to re-animator and bride of reanimator -lrb- 2 far better films ... -rrb- . this one has the infamous dr. west in prison and experimenting on rats since it 's all he can get a hold of in terms of `` patients '' . i 'm not really gon na bother explaining any more of the film , because by about 20 minutes into it , i lost all interest . not enough gore , a few silly scenes - nothing of any real merit . i was really disappointed with this one . i know a lot of other re-animator fans seem to like this one a lot , maybe we did n't see the same film . for what it 's worth , i say stay away from this one ... 3/10		3		0
wow ... were there really racial stereotypes as bad as that in the movies less than ten years ago ? probably the most offensive thing out of many offensive things in species ii , mykelti williamson plays a man who ca n't utter a single sentence without it being a reference to himself as a `` brother '' , or how much he wants some `` bootie '' . there 's even a reference to him having large genitals , and of course when he gets the girl , she has to be black . god forbid he should actually date a white girl , right ? i 'm actually amazed they did n't just stick a mop and bucket and a bowl of kfc in his hand and have done with it . an absolutely risible representation of black man in a trash movie . naturally , this being hollywood then the strong -lrb- ie . white male -rrb- survive to dominate the picture . sure , the women can talk about science , but they 're there to be told to shut up and sit back so we can concentrate on natasha henstridge 's breasts . of course , in these sort of films the makers forget that someone gets to be an alpha male by brains as well as testosterone , so we get the thick as bricks patrick -lrb- played by justin lazard -rrb- walking around doing whatever he pleases . hey , he 's a red blooded , wholesome american - he gets to do what he wants , right ? that includes having the exploitative titillation of the entire premise -lrb- alien propagates via sex -rrb- subverted with an attempted rape . there 's even a delightful cut scene instated on the dvd where he kills a transvestite . lovely stuff . in the opposite corner as the tolerable face of masculinity is michael madsen in a `` what the hell is he doing in this ? '' excursion . i see from imdb that two straight-to-video sequels were released . as i ca n't think why on earth i watched the first one , let alone the second , then i think i 'll give them a miss . truly repulsive film-making . oh , one last thing - look out for the glass when eve -lrb- henstridge -rrb- breaks out of her cage . it actually shatters before she touches it .		3		0
give `` the '' credit for being a pretty good period piece , which seems to recreate hapsburg austria pretty faithfully -lrb- notwithstanding the fact that there was no `` crown prince leopold '' - a character apparently loosely based on the real-life crown prince rudolf -rrb- and also for having some pretty strong performances - especially from edward norton as eisenheim , and from paul as inspector uhl . those couple of positive notes , though , were n't enough to save a bizarre and confusing story which tries to mix a magician 's tricks with a murder mystery . essentially , eisenheim gets entangled in the murder of sophie -lrb- jessica biel -rrb- , a woman engaged to the crown prince but who , in the past , was passionately in love with eisenheim himself . she ends up being murdered , and eisenheim is convinced that leopold is responsible . the movie never explicitly identifies leopold as the murderer , but it is clearly implied . significant parts of the movie are told in flashbacks , especially near the beginning as the past relationship between eisenheim and sophie is portrayed . i thought the story was weak and lacked any real sense of excitement ; anything that would grab a viewer and really pull them in . because of the positive points i mentioned at the beginning , i 'll rate this as a 3/10 .		3		0
` highlander ii ' is constantly derided as a prime example of a sequel that ruins the original , but to my mind there 's no drop in quality . like the first film this is a poorly acted load of old rubbish , a disjointed series of disconnected scenes and headache-inducing action sequences barely held together by a diabolical screenplay . it seems quite faithful to me . michael ironside and john c. mcginley are usually worth watching but here they ham it up to no avail , while sean connery somehow manages to make himself the film 's saving grace despite putting in next to no effort . i 'm sure that director russell mulcahy could bash out a decent film if only he was given a script that was n't a load of garbage , but he never has . mindless drivel .		3		0
technically flashy , but a shitty script : there is hardly a brief statement that better summarizes what 's been wrong with american cinema in the past decade or so . one would think , or at least hope , that anno 2011 big-budget movies would have moved from unintentionally comical low-budget 50s fluff such as `` the brain from planet arous '' ; far from it . little -lrb- and large -rrb- spidery alien parasites are on yet another filmic tour of the human body . destination : brain . misson : kill kill kill . they might as well have called this silly flick `` spider aliens from the moon vs. nasa '' . at least it would have been honest , instead of feigning seriousness by giving this silly story a documentary feel . as if `` realism '' can make a bunch of sneaky alien spiders seem any less absurd than they 'd been back in the 50s . in fact , would have worked much better had it adopted an honest , goofy , down-to-earth -lrb- -rrb- `` mars attacks '' approach . that movie is pretty weak too , but at least burton did n't try to present a decidedly low-brow idea in a high-brow manner . in spite of it being cloaked in fancy visuals , is nothing more than a cheesy movie . you can paint a turd blue , it still remains a turd . the fact that the filmmakers had the balls to drag nasa through the mud by portraying the entire space program as some kind of devious scheme run by cold , devil-may-care scientists and engineers who put no worth on human life -- this does n't exactly help matters . it 's very easy to be cynical about great achievements of others -- especially when you 're a loser hollywood writer whose own intellect is dwarfed by that of the `` dumbest '' nasa scientist . the true paranoia of does n't stem from the brain of the astronaut nate ; it 's in the heads of the conspiracy-theory obsessed morons who wrote this absurd drivel . i 'd like to use this opportunity to address the cliché issue of alien cover-ups by governments . once and for all , let 's get this myth of the little round ship being hidden away from the public . if either the or the americans had discovered alien creatures on the moon -lrb- or anywhere else for that matter -rrb- , the last thing either would have done -lrb- or do -rrb- was to keep it a jealously guarded top-secret . regardless of whether they 'd found an alien bacteria , an alien vegetable , or a blood-sucking spider that latches itself telepathically onto the brain of its human victims , any world power would have been more than happy to boast to the rest of the world of the amazing discovery -- particularly the fact that it was their side -lrb- hence their political system -rrb- that brought about this discovery first . the two opposing cold-war sides were in engaged in competition , remember ? it was a propaganda war . whoever discovered an alien would 've been the `` winner '' -- for all practical purposes - in the much-touted space race . and yet these , almost totally braindead conspiracy theorists -lrb- i.e the various ufologist cretins out there -rrb- always take the position that if any government ever discovered an alien species , this discovery would be kept away from the public at all cost and forever . why would they ?! this defies all logic , and negates the essential psychological profile i.e. essential characteristic of top politicians : i.e. the `` look what i 've done '' mentality . not to mention the fact that it would have been close to impossible for both sides to keep this under wraps for decades and decades . no , not because of brilliant investigative journalism -lrb- because those exist only in movies ; the vast majority are morons -rrb- but because such an astounding discovery would eventually leak into the public . besides , the more people are involved in a large conspiracy the harder it is to keep it secret ; doubtlessly , an alien cover-up would have to involve quite a few people . the very idea that apollo 18 was sent to the moon `` secretly '' is utterly laughable . rocket launches were a rarity in those days , so i do n't see how such an event could have gone unnoticed by the press . it 's not exactly like a firecracker going off . press : `` hey ... look at that ! did n't they launch a rocket just now ? ... nasa , what are you guys doing over there ? '' nasa : `` oh , um ... nothing . it was n't a rocket ... it was a ... um ... a large pointy thing that only ... er ... looks like a rocket . '' this is 's bizarre conspiracy theory in a nutshell : americans find out that the soviets had encountered aliens on the moon -lrb- either through espionage or cooperation -rrb- , and decide to send a team of guinea-pig astronauts -- totally unaware why they 're going up there in the first place -lrb- ! -rrb- - just to see what happens when the aliens start harassing them . do they suck their blood ? do they chew on their ears ? eat their bellies perhaps ? moronic . it would have made far more sense for nasa to inform the public , then get even more funding , and launch numerous expeditions with crews that know what to expect , equipped and trained to deal with the unknown , that way giving nasa and the government a better chance of gathering more useful information . was n't the gathering of information one of the primary objectives of every mission ? not according to morons who consider `` ancient aliens '' to be a documentary science series . when i saw the names of the weinstein brothers in the end-credits , it all suddenly made sense . not only are their names usually a guarantee that a filmic product will stink , but if there 's a pair of decadent left-wing anti-capitalist hollywood hypocrites , it 's those two . trust them to ok this crap , and then invest in it . i 'm quite glad turned out to be such a pathetic flop . still , at least the casting is vastly superior to those `` astronauts '' in `` apollo 13 '' . no bacon or hanks here .		3		0
i will be honest and say that i did n't think much of the original jamie lee curtis version , but it is rated three out of five stars and liked by most people , this remake was rated one star , i was interested to see why . basically donna keppel -lrb- brittany snow -rrb- spent three years haunted by the memory of her deranged high school teacher richard fenton -lrb- johnathon schaech -rrb- murdering her family , having a nightmare almost all the time , but she may be getting over it at last . this comes just in time for her high school prom night -lrb- the same night her family was murdered -rrb- , but she wants to remember all of it , so does n't bother taking her calming pills . while she goes with her boyfriend bobby -lrb- scott porter -rrb- and two couples of friends to the grand hotel , killer richard has escaped from the prison which he was never to be released from , and he obviously wants to get donna . the police have found out about the psychopath 's escape , and know that he will be going wherever donna is , so they make their way to the prom , while richard has mingled his way into the hotel and found a room near her 's . donna is obviously having fun with her friends , completely unaware of the killer being in the building , but she a few jumps from the fact that she is not calming herself . one by one , her friends and some of the hotel staff members fall victim to richard 's deadly blade , and donna realises that he is there , and now she and everyone else is in danger . but everyone including her naively sticks around , and when it looks like the psycho is gone , he manages to get away unnoticed back to the home of donna , but do n't worry , he gets killed by the end . also starring jessica stroup as claire , dana davis as lisa hines , collins pennie as ronnie heflin , kelly blatz as michael , james as detective nash , brianne davis as crissy lynn , idris elba as detective winn and kellan lutz as rick leland . this has a pretty different plot line to the original , which saw three friends accidentally kill someone , and that someone wants revenge , i could almost say that this version was an improvement , but i know that i would n't watch this or the other one again . this one is completely predictable most of the time , the characters , apart from the smart killer of course , and thick and easy victims , there are stupid fake jumps , it could have been bloodier and made itself different to the original , and it just was n't very scary , a silly horror thriller remake . adequate !		3		0
sad but good for thirty seconds was anne bancroft on her death bed getting her son nicholas cage to promise never to marry . this scene is followed by two minutes of running the credits over a cutesy cartoon sequence like something retro from the late fifties or early sixties . sure he 's never going to marry , especially when his girl friend is sarah jessica parker , pretty girl with very rounded tush and gams of steel . this is a low-brow flick , stupid enough to be campy , or at least that was the idea . elvis impersonators are always good for a laugh , right ? and james caan as a sleazy vegas gambler , that 's good , huh ? and a guy losing his wife in a card game ? you got ta love it ! not . as in not funny , not clever , not interesting and not worth watching . i gave up after about fifteen minutes , and i tried , i really did . -lrb- note : over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book `` cut to the chaise lounge or i ca n't believe i swallowed the remote !

` salem 's lot aspect ratio : 1.78:1 sound format : dolby digital whilst researching material for a new book , a writer -lrb- david soul -rrb- returns to his home town and finds it infested by vampires operating from within a creepy old house overlooking the area . mikael salomon 's ill-advised remake of tobe hooper 's classic tv miniseries tells much the same story , but fails in almost every respect . peter filardi 's script takes fewer liberties with stephen king 's novel than the original , but salomon demonstrates no great empathy with the material , and the results are turgid and uninvolving . there 's very little urgency in the depiction of a creeping menace which threatens to overwhelm the eponymous town , only a sense of indifference as salomon consistently fluffs many of the ingredients which distinguished the original : the to the marsten house is resolved in a perfunctory manner ; marjorie glick 's return from the dead occurs too quickly and lacks even the most rudimentary elements of suspense ; the climactic showdown between good and evil inside the marsten house unfolds in routine fashion , etc. . on the plus side , rob lowe is an inspired choice for the role originally taken by david soul -lrb- his love-hate relationship with the marsten house is clearly established this time around -rrb- , and there 's a memorable scene in which an unpleasant school bus driver -lrb- andy anderson -rrb- gets his comeuppance at the hands of his former ` victims ' . elsewhere , andre braugher essays the role of a gay teacher whose sexuality fuels his first encounter with the living dead -lrb- beauty christopher morris -rrb- , a huge turnaround from the original version . but the movie is labored to the point of redundancy , and seems to last an eternity . with his white hair and beard , donald sutherland 's villain comes off looking like a demonic santa claus , and rutger hauer -lrb- anne rice 's original choice for the role of lestat in a film adaptation of her novel ` interview with the vampire ' -rrb- is barely on-screen long enough to make an impression as the lead vampire , though his portrayal is thoroughly undistinguished . production values are fine , and ben nott 's photography makes a virtue of the bleak landscape and wintry locations -lrb- the movie was shot in australia , doubling for new england -rrb- , but the characters seem totally disconnected from one another , and the film is n't remotely frightening . it does n't simply fail in comparison with the original miniseries , or even with the novel ; it fails on its own terms , and has few redeeming virtues .		3		0
in the words of art bell just after the kreskin vegas fiasco ... lame , lame , lame . the action jumped around like a rabbit on crank , not spending nearly enough time with many of the scenes for a complete telling of the story . the dialogue was tepid and all those rambling songs were just dull , empty filler . the producers managed to take one of the best novels of the 60 's and butcher it without mercy . it was fun seeing some of the old players however this film was anything but a keeper .		3		0
you know that you 're in trouble when only two people in the whole theatre are laughing at the jokes . i , robot is the latest hollywood action movie . though i loved will smith in mib , id4 and even enemy of the state , his acting in this movie was less than memorable . or maybe is was just the really , really bad dialog . except for will 's movie grandmother everyone else was forgettable at best . the plot was more than poor it was juvenile and having will be angry because a robot saved him instead of someone else was silly , especially when we find out that he has benefited from robotics . most of all i hated the ending . human pride took over , so will gets to save everyone inspite of the fact that we know that sonny could have done it just as well . no imagination whatsoever on the part of the writers . a better ending would have been for sonny to have saved them both . i liked the terminator robots take over the world movies better .		3		0
the huge success of `` scream '' in 1996 enabled to launch a new trend in the horror movie . this trend is based on a so-far peaceful universe but destroyed by the arrival of a disruptive element which is epitomized by a serial-killer . i would also add that since `` scream '' and another `` i know what you did last summer '' , anything goes to shot horror movies whose topic deals with a serial-killer . here , saint valentine 's day is used as a pretext to shot a new opus with the quoted topic . the result gives a movie that barely shines by the originality of the directing , the paucity of the script , the impression of `` déjà-vu '' in several moments -lrb- murders -rrb- . `` valentine '' brings nothing new to an already threadbare topic . you may skip this movie without remorse .		3		0
george romero directed the classic dawn of the dead in 1979 ; eleven years after his classic , night of the living dead . shaun of the dead is a parody of romero 's horror film . shaun hangs out in a pub every night and breaks up with his girlfriend . along the way , he also fights with his mother and stepfather . suffering from a hangover , he and his friends are attacked by zombies . the violence is typical and the comedy repetitive and tiresome . i do not understand the 8/10 rating on imdb . i usually am a fan of british humor ; but not this time . i would recommend zombieland as an alternative . it is far superior movie with an outstanding performance by woody harrelson .		3		0
although this movie has a lot of heart , and was well directed , and especially casted and acted ... it leaves you wondering what the point of the film was . this story was centered around five irish immigrants coming into the u.s. illegally and `` finding themselves '' ` in america ' . it 's not at all absurd of an idea , because i 'm sure that this happens every day almost . however , i completely disagreed with the message they were sending in a lot of different areas . first off , they make it seem romantic and exciting sneaking into another country illegally . secondly , they make the idea of living in a drug infested apartment complex , with criminals and drug dealers , alright and no big deal . as if nothing bad would ever happen to them , or their two young girls . i found the movie boring and quite slow , and although i understand that different people have different tastes in film , i for one found it dry and hard to swallow . it was dull and made very little sense at times . but , if you are looking for a more emotional , and artistic piece in the process , you might like this . again , the acting was very good , and some of the story was interesting ... however , i personally will never watch it again .		3		0
from the trailer this movie did n't seem like it 's going to be anything special , but it seemed like stupid fun . first scene that takes place is in a.d. and started off a bit lame and should not be taken seriously at all . but i had hopes that it would at least be stupid fun and for the most part it was only half right . than the movie flash-forward to a.d with crusaders in the 14th century but the two main character are nicholas cage and ron perlman . anyways these crusaders look super hypocritical in this constantly getting drunk with women . than go off killing more people in a brutal manner , now i do n't know if crusades worked that way but it just seemed like the creator of this movie really do n't like christians . anyways after a bunch of killings nicholas cage 's character realize this is going the wrong direction . which i found to be humorous how it lead to that scenario after the beginning few minutes of him drinking laughing and killing . nicholas cage does n't seem to take acting or even himself seriously anymore , especially in this . his acting and actions are just laughable literally . this is a b-movie at best from nicholas cage and i do n't know if some seems was intentionally suppose to be funny but it did n't seem like it , and yet it 's funny . i did n't know this was suppose to be a comedy , from the trailer it is n't suppose to be one but sometimes it does seem like it . well at least it 's a fast paced movie that is close to a hour and 30 minutes . i do n't know if it 's because nicholas cage do n't care much about his acting career or something , cause i have no idea how they convinced him to take this role . maybe it was just the money issue . there is nothing much in the story either , the two main characters and a group of other are on a mission to transport a girl who is persecuted for being a witch or from just a intuition of being a witch , from point a to point b. just watch `` black death '' which is a different story but similar premise and is a better movie . 3.8 / 10		3		0
seeing naked lunch again takes me back to the autumn months of ' 92 . every thursday some friends and i would grab a takeaway and a rental from the local video store , taking it in turns to choose the evenings ' movie . normally i would consider myself a reasonable judge of what looks to be a good film , yet each time it was my turn to choose i would inexplicably pick a stinker . john lithgow in a dress , murdering people in confused flashbacks with `` raising cain '' ? what was i thinking ? keanu reeves as an englishman abroad for coppolla 's `` dracula '' ? oh , how can i ever live down the shame ? the star of robocop as an agent for insectoid , alien lifeforms in the form of talking typewriters ? how can i show my face again ? naked lunch was my third and final choice on these sojourns . not necessarily because i was forbidden a further choice , but after three clunkers in a row i could n't face the potential embarrassment of another . naked lunch was the worst of the three , a cinematic rendition of a wordy , stream-of-consciousness novel that is heavily and completely fails to work on the screen . an exterminator who injects himself with bug deterrent suffers hallucinations -- or are they , to be honest i did n't fully understand it all -- and becomes a writer that indulges in espionage and homosexuality while getting high from the juices of alien lifeforms . i realised when watching the movie a second time -lrb- or the first , as i 've never made it to the end before -rrb- that i 've seen an unhealthy amount of david cronenberg films . this only struck me halfway through as naked lunch is not typical of the director and i did n't initially realise it was the same man . set in new york , 1953 , it 's drab surroundings and sepia are quite unlike anything the director has attempted before . ironically , the elements of a cronenberg movie that you consider detracting -- the juvenile need for excessive gore , the shallow characterisation and frenetic pace -- are sorely missed here , as naked lunch is a film without dramatic conflict . it just goes along at it 's own meandering pace , with a monotone weller to pretentious events and telling anecdotes about talking . -lrb- yes , really -rrb- . i think it shows a lack of sophistication to label any film as `` boring '' , but if i were to do so then this dull offering would be it . on a shallow note , it has already dated , it 's puppetry misplaced after less than ten years with cgi . i 'm not a fan of computer-generated effects , but at least they could have done it for the mouths to make their lines in synch . looking at it positively , although this film is n't successful , it did show a growing ambition in the director that lead to the extremely controversial `` crash '' . naked lunch , then . the cronenberg with an adult pacing and plentiful dialogue . such a pity it 's a perfect antidote for insomnia .		4		0
this is another dot com failure ! . the premise for this film could have worked if the characters were developed , and if stephen rea -lrb- he is very good in `` in dreams '' another dark film with annete bening as a psychiatric patient -rrb- was actually given a chance to act . he is a very good actor who sometimes transcends the material . not so in this case . as it starts out it seems suspenseful ; people are being it 's related to a website . remember `` the net '' ? . `` they have my information ... oh , no '' ... sandra bullock screams to dennis miller -lrb- good for a laugh , today -rrb- . if you want to see something truly frightening and well acted , rent `` session 9 '' or `` ju-on '' the original `` grudge '' . much more original . 4/10 .		4		0
the film armored represents a clear case of hollywood 's negative influence in cinematographic : in 2003 , hungarian director antal found a good answer with the excellent film kontroll , an exotic hybrid of urban thriller and comedy , which besides of telling us a fascinating story set in budapest subway train , it also included wise commentaries about the unpredictable development of hungarian society in the post-communist environment .4 years later , antal was seduced by hollywood and he made the mediocre , but moderately entertaining horror film more recently , he made armored , a horrible , hollow , full of clichés and unsatisfactory action film . i found the screenplay from armored to be deplorable ; the plan from the criminals does not have too much sense , nor it seems credible in the 21st century ; and in order to cover some of those holes , screenwriter james v. simpson decided to leave some significant elements from the story in the darkness -lrb- is it that easy to disable the electronic system from an armored truck ? i may may try it some of these days -rrb- . however , a good director such as antal could rescue the movie with the help of his cast and a bit of energy , can not he ? fortunately , the answer is is one of the most boring and passive action film i have seen in a long time.the situations this movie portraits did not make me feel suspense or any emotion -lrb- is the boredom an emotion ? -rrb- , even with the help of the distinguished character actors who appear on it.i almost felt pity for matt dillon , jean reno , laurence fishburne and fred ward , because they brought such good works in other movies that it was demoralizing to see them as sleepwalkers on same applies to skeet ulrich and milo ventimiglia , but instead of pity for them , i felt the confirmation of the antipathy they have always provoked on me . so , armored is an absolutely tedious action film because it lacks of originality , the story is bad , blah blah blah ... i do not need to repeat my long list of worries to me is that antal is currently working on predators , the fourth sequel ? `` re-imagination '' ? remake ? of predator , under the supervision of robert rodriguez , whose work i usually like , although i can not deny he has made some big false moves in his career.i truly hope that franchise is not ruined , as it happened with the atrocious aliens vs. predator : requiem ; however , the precedent created by armored is not very encouraging , because it is needed a genuine `` '' to waste four excellent actors , and to make a chase of armored trucks to be boring instead of it happen something similar with the predators ? i hope it will not ... but the best thing is to have low expectations .		4		0
`` tron : legacy '' is a beautiful mess . packed with state of the art visuals , from the striking blue and orange neon oasis of a computer world to the disquieting de-aging of jeff bridges , it 's just a shame that a decent script had n't been hammered out beforehand . `` legacy '' could have been a stunner . instead , it 's merely supermodel entertainment -- gorgeous but vapid . you 'd think a movie about a brainiac hacker would be a little smarter . granted , there 's enough techy gobbledygook to choke a computer processor , but it has the opposite of the desired effect . incomprehensible and long-winded expository scenes make clear that `` legacy '' is the worst breed of hand-holding blockbuster -- characters formulate and execute plans in ceaseless sequence until they reach end protocol . structurally , the film is like a bad sonnet . probably the single most egregious problem with `` legacy 's '' screenplay is its entirely uninteresting characters . reluctant hero sam flynn -lrb- garrett hedlund -rrb- is the son of bridges ' character from the 1982 original . perhaps it 's fitting that the character is cast adrift in an artificial world , because he 's the least dynamic human being on earth . a living soul should stick out like a sore thumb when compared to anthropomorphized computer programs , but though sam gawks and cracks wise , the truth is that his character is as lifeless as a filing cabinet . i ca n't think of three adjectives to describe him . bridges does n't have much to work with either as the elder flynn ; the man is a bottomless well of exposition peppered with antiquated colloquialisms -lrb- `` dig , '' `` jazz , '' `` man , '' e.g. `` i do n't dig that jazz , man '' -rrb- leftover from his overzealous performance in `` tron '' prime . olivia wilde plays quorra , the last of a super-advanced cyber species with whom personality certainly died . and then there 's martin sheen as zuse , who has enough eccentricities for the four of them combined . he plays the role of an opportunistic bartender like a greek bohemian , giving a bizarre and unrestrained performance that feels more than a little out of place . he 's in the movie maybe a combined six minutes . unfortunately , the story that binds these characters together is just as forgettable . even as they bolt through its interminable second-half , it feels as though nothing is happening . their motivator is literally `` get to the portal , '' which means `` legacy '' is essentially a chase film . the only method employed to break-up the razzle-dazzle action sequences are paunchy bouts of dialogue that beget subplots that beget more chase . there is never a moment to stop and admire the world around them , or even to understand it . the universe of `` tron '' never feels alive -- it is merely an eye-candy coating over the bland events that comprise this tasteless narrative . i do not mean to undersell `` tron : legacy '' on a visual or technical level . the production design is superlative , and the digital wizardry -lrb- re : the ` curious case of jeff bridges ' -rrb- could be revolutionary . `` legacy '' is a beautiful film , but none of that changes the fact that its screenplay is a disaster . it 's never a good sign when you have six writers attached to the same piece of material , and the sequel to `` tron '' is an open and shut case of too many cooks . outside of the aesthetic artistry and a memorable soundtrack by daft punk , there is little to remember `` tron : legacy '' for . its characters are cardboard and its plot is paper-thin . and without substance , all the cosmetics in the world ca n't save you . sorry , supermodels .		4		0
i already gave this movie bonus points for daring to be small and actually shoot some scenes on location in japan . it dawned on me how the x-men franchise went the opposite direction as the avengers . x-men began as an ensemble then broke the characters off -lrb- magneto and xavier as part of x-men first class & the first wolverine -rrb- . avengers introduced the main players on their own before combining them . the problem with the x-men franchise is that the wolverine character on it 's own leaves something to be desired . it feels like the wolverine set out to be the antithesis of the standard super hero movie . but i think they swung the pendulum a little too far the other way . i fault the motivations of wolverine in this smaller film . he is supposed to be always gruff and not interested in helping anyone . but he is somehow convinced to go to japan based on a man he helped 60 years ago but never maintained contact . i think he should have been someone a bit more deeply connected to yashida and his life was in danger , not just a visit to his deathbed . i do n't require a summer film to be non-stop action , but the pacing in this film still could use some spark . the time spent setting up the characters in japan is too sedate . you can spark the story along by learning about these characters while taking action . i think of the pacing in the bourne movies . wolverine 's exposure to the yakuza threat should have been through confrontation , not exposition by his designated sidekick . the slow cooking plot is just not tautly edited to create any real momentum . the story itself lacks any real surprises , and wolverine 's tepid involvement just gave the whole movie an emotional detachment . i will credit the female lead , tao okamoto , as being both attractive and a credible actress . i found her somewhat a sympathetic character , but in the end , the clumsy setup did n't allow her important opening scene to transpire with the gravitas the movie wanted . i think of the gravitas thrust upon us in the latest bond film `` skyfall '' , and it all seems to come back to wolverine 's detachment with yashida , the person he dispassionately is supposed to say goodbye to on his deathbed . we needed another scene after the exciting nagasaki bomb sequence , where wolverine and yashida bond after saving his life . i was thinking perhaps yashida taught martial arts to wolverine and we see logan for once have a home -lrb- playing into the whole samurai and master relationship -rrb- . maybe a subsequent flashback where logan parts ways with yashida , perhaps over a dispute that could resonate in the present day . so much more punch was possible in the storytelling . alas , there is generic exposition , despite the attractive oriental setting . as for the new mutants , i found the sidekick yukio a lame mutant , but a terrific character nonetheless . straight out of tarantino 's fun `` kill bill part 2 '' or rodriguez 's `` sin city '' , the innocent schoolgirl with deadly fighting skills made her by far the most interesting character in the film . her supposed special talent is to foresee someone 's future . but yet she never demonstrates that ability . the other is the actual villain of the movie , viper . she is an intense young woman who can blow poison gas , or train insects to burrow into your heart , or something . her evil powers were pretty lame as well . as for yashida , the industrialist who wants immortality , that also seems half-cooked . the third act throws in some special effects that frankly seem out of place for a film that quite deliberately made a point of not being that type of film . the pacing of this film should have taken more of a bourne approach , and let wolverine show a little more empathy for other humans , instead of wallowing in his depression of jean grey . wolverine could have been like the new bond in his motivations , and not perpetually detached . i 'd wait for the dvd .		4		0
balls of fury is a movie that takes the mickey out of martial arts movies , throwing in a few cheap laughs , and nothing more . like bad movies with plenty of cheese that adopts martial arts like mortal kombat and doa , balls follows the usual formula of having a prodigy fall from grace , only to be thrusted into a mission that involves prior intense training , and meeting with an adversary who in turn is skilled by the same martial arts teacher , so that the finale is a fight of values . often there 's a secret weapon involved too , and there 's no other direct reference i can think of except that this backtracks all the way to bruce lee 's enter the dragon , which the other two movies probably had traces of too . there 's a tournament organized for the best of the best to pit their skills in , and the gladiators come from all over the world -lrb- so that you can include some poor geographically based comedy , in this case -rrb- . like shih 's character in enter the dragon , you have an enigmatic megalomaniac as the chief of the tournament , held in a mansion , and in no time , our hero -lrb- hey , just for another bruce lee related reference for the heck of it , jason scott lee 's in this picture as well , though only as a supporting cast member -rrb- will discover its dark secrets , and kick the living daylights out of everyone to escape . except that in balls , it is a ping pong / table tennis tournament , and the master of tournament is feng -lrb- christopher walken , and i have no idea what 's he doing here too -rrb- , with assistance provided by cary-hiroyuki tagawa , who is relegated from a similar head honcho role in the mortal kombat movie . and leading the charge to break into the tournament , is one time table tennis child prodigy randy daytona -lrb- dan fogler -rrb- , a disgraced player now a fat shadow of his past formidable self , persuaded into the competition by a secret agent fbi man agent ernie -lrb- george lopez -rrb- for the purpose of some serious federal investigations . the comedy here is a bit tired , and most of the best bits were already included in the trailer . you have the usual sexist jokes involving sexy female characters , like the conveniently named maggie -lrb- maggie q , doing so little and wearing even less -rrb- , tired fat jokes , and plenty more from the blind sifu master wong -lrb- james hong -rrb- , whom i thought had probably the best lines in the movie , nevermind that most of them consists of faux pas martial arts philosophy full of sexual innuendos , and plenty of politically incorrectness coupled with slapstick physical comedy . but what went into effective overdrive , were the increasing attempts of sleight-of-hand moments in misdirection , which were spot on and timed perfectly . other attempts though fell flat , especially those trying to recreate the spirit of nonsensical moments by the comedies , such as the inclusion of the sex slaves . however balls turns out to be pretty bland overall , and the storyline already well summarized in the trailer . do n't expect too much , and you might enjoy a chuckle or two . otherwise rent this instead .		4		0
how odd to find a film that tries to combine several light-hearted things at once : humour , ridicule of an apparent loser , sex appeal , high octane chase sequences , large and loud black women who either yell their lines or say them in a fast and sarcastic manner and equally ; how not so odd to find that it all just implodes on itself . taxi is not a funny film , it 's not a smart film and it 's not really that entertaining either . the fact the funniest parts of taxi occur during the end credits in the form of outtakes allows the old gem ` the film was so bad that the best bits are the end credits ' to come to the surface but it also says a lot about the film overall . if a film is listed as a comedy , i sort of expect it to be funny and funny this is n't . some examples of the ` humour ' come in the form of silly voices , a police man 's badge getting fried to a crisp and then having it handed back to him as well as queen latifah doing her best with a weary script as she cracks dumb jokes and silly one liners whilst haring down a new york street at , wait for it : . i know that films are n't supposed to be ` real ' as they 're set in an entirely different world but half the things that happen in taxi should never have even occurred in the first place . we are led to believe that a group of attractive brazilian women -lrb- who are models in real life -rrb- are able to rob new york banks , use sophisticated weaponry and get away pretty easy -- it 's up to new york 's stupidest cop and most annoying cab driver to foil them , which of course they do and they make a lot better job of it than the normal new york police service whom it would seem could n't catch a cold . this brings me onto the ` good guys ' and ` bad guys ' . the ` bad guys ' are n't actually guys ; they 're pin ups and in fact they 're not even characters ; they 're objects -- they do n't even need to speak english . now the ` good guys ' ; the character of washburn -lrb- fallon -rrb- is that of a complete moron . he lives next door to his constantly drunk mother -lrb- another attempt at weak humour -- alcoholism is meant to be funny !? -rrb- , he in a silly and unfunny manner and basically manages to cock up everything he does : he ca n't drive or even hold up his badge to tell people he 's a cop without having it pinched from him . his efforts to get it back resemble that of a ten year old trying to get something an adult 's taken away from them . if taxi does have a redeeming feature it 's that the chases , albeit often abrupt , are entertaining if you just sit back and watch and although it sounds terrible of me to say so , looking at the four brazilian women work their stuff as they either rob banks or drive fast cars or even just standing there is entertaining merely due to the fact they 're pretty to look at . but that ca n't be held against me as the film 's made that way -- remember that they did n't have to be stunning women but that 's what the writer wanted and that 's what we get . if you watch taxi your brain really does need to be off the entire time since chases , weak humour and pretty girls is about all you 're going to get .		4		0
silver bullet -lrb- 1985 -rrb- was another bad adaptation of a stephen king novel . the book was originally based upon an idea for a calender . but the original concept was expanded to novel size . like any book that was printed during the eighties , it was seized by dino de laurentis -lrb- a major stephen king movie backer -rrb- and optioned for a film release . the film would star haim -lrb- one of the two infamous -rrb- megan follows and the `` new '' look of gary busey -lrb- re-inventing himself as a nick nolte wannabe -rrb- . the film makers did n't know if they wanted to be serious or a cheesy parody . the sad results are on the screen . i was expecting more when i first saw it . but i was disappointed . it would have been a great spoof but i guess that was n't in the cards . who or what is stalking the residents ? why did gary busey change his image ? what is the silver bullet ? you 'll have to find out for yourself when you watch silver bullet ! not recommended -lrb- unless you 're an eighties horror fan -rrb- .		4		0
a transport plane flying north of greenland with a pilot , a co-pilot and a three-man crew freezes up and makes an emergency landing in frozen , desolate northwest canada -lrb- we 're told that `` ice is an airplane 's enemy '' -rrb- ; all area pilots hope to lend their support despite the weather conditions because stranded pilot dooley -lrb- john wayne -rrb- is something of a legend in his own time . though directed by william wellman and written by ernest gann -lrb- from his novel -rrb- -- both flying aficionados -- `` island in the sky '' does n't work as a melodrama nor as a solid adventure story . filmed in a square and straightforward way , it often resembles a training film for pilots , and wayne struggles with his one-dimensional character . gann 's source novel probably did n't need passages of human conversation to propel the story ; yet , when transcribed for the screen , the actors are left spouting technical jargon for over 100 minutes , and all we have left to ponder is the rescue . ** from ****		4		0
first of all , i absolutely love the cartoon , it is a classic , and great fun for adults and kids alike . unfortunately , while there are some redeeming qualities , inspector gadget , came across for me as dull , uninspired and disappointing . but it is not the worst movie ever , i did think disaster movie and home alone 4 were much worse . there are some bright spots . one is the special effects , they were very very good and the best part of the movie . it is true that the film is a tad low on laughs , though the part when the thumb turns itself into a cigarette lighter does raise a chuckle or two . there are some terrific scenes involving gadget 's robot self , a car chase and a helicopter . and joely fisher is lovely as brenda , and rupert everett , ever reliable , makes an entertaining doctor claw . unfortunately , that 's where the positives end . i am in complete agreement with anyone who thinks that it could 've been so much better . matthew broderick struggles to make a convincing enough title character , but i do think it is to do with the fact that the role of inspector gadget is badly underwritten . having said that , the script is very weak , and lacks any sense of plot and drive , and the plot is rather slow moving and does n't make much sense . plus the editing was rather choppy . overall , a disappointing film , that could 've been so much better . had it been more faithful to the show , and had more of a sense of fun , it could have been a great film rather than a mediocre one . 4/10 for trying . bethany cox		4		0
this film is about a once successful car dealer who becomes increasingly solitary and helpless through his actions . what is there to like about `` solitary man '' ? it has a strong cast that is put into good use . michael douglas carries his unlikable character well , he is very believable and convincing . however , everything else seems to be unlikable . the plot revolves entirely around a unsympathetic and unlikable person , which gives me no reason to like the film . everything ben kalmen does sends him further down the bottom . just when you think he can not mess up anymore than he already has , he messes up again . this continual provocation is not fun to watch . as for the ending , i find it almost condescending to have a debriefing of the plot , and then an ambiguous ending . after sitting through 90 minutes , the viewers really deserve better treatment than that .		4		0
ronald chetwynd hayes is a very underrated author . his horror stories often feature a twist ending mixed in with lots of black humour . i read his tales of fear and fantasy short story collection as a sixteen year old and can fondly remember the stories featured . hardcore horror fans who enjoy gore will probably consider his stories quaint but as an entertaining read i recommend him . unfortunately i find it difficult to recommend the monster club to anyone john carradine plays the author who goes to a club only to find it populated by monsters and meets a vampire called eramus who describes different types of bloodlines of monsters and relates three short stories . there 's two serious problems with the film 1 -rrb- director roy ward baker does n't know whether to make the film serious or amusing and decides on embarrassing camp 2 -rrb- the stories themselves are pretty dire . baker can defend himself in that he does n't have much of a budget and much of the make-up is dire , especially the werewolf in the nhs glasses . that said however it 's the way the werewolf is played that leaves a lot to be desired . baker however does pull out a chilling sequence done via drawings where a vicar relates how he found a ghoul in a graveyard . the sequence is very well done but seems completely at odds with the rest of the film which is a badly judged jokey , camp affair . and the revelation that the human race is the worst type of monster is n't a revelation at all		4		0
when i saw it i could not decide if it were good or bad . actually i found it very weird . when i was in the video store and wondering which film i should rent to me and my friends . this was the movie which catched my attention . the story looked interesting and it seemed lika a very exiting film . it begins awful and many parts in the film makes you just wan na turn off the television . but the film has very exciting scenes and is well done . i think that this is the kind of action movie you watch and two hours later you forget almost everything . there were two things that really make me feel that it was not a good film . first of all i felt that the characters had no depth at all . one old trained man that could everything and one sick soldier that had gone mad . it did not explain much more than that . the other thing was that it was not realistic at all . if it would be realistic i think that they could not have done this film . what has happened to the action genre ? the last two new action films i saw was this and `` basic '' -lrb- which also was a pretty bad film -rrb- . for a couple of years ago i saw a loots of good action like `` face off '' or `` the rock '' . i hope that some great director soon will do a stunning masterpiece with both a great story and great action . personal i think that this was a pretty silly film and i only rank it a :4 / 10		4		0
and that 's `` ghost ship '' . high computer effects , good amount of gore , and a dash of over acting . do n't you just love it ? i finally watched `` ghost ship '' with same expectations of `` thirteen ghosts '' . i loved `` thirteen ghosts '' , but `` ghost ship '' is mostly a rip off of these horror movies that have been released in the past 4 years . the movie starts off strong with awesome effects and kills . then the plot comes . if you can even call it that . as usual `` greed will imprison us all '' . i am getting a little sick of it . but at the same time , yes , i did enjoy `` house on haunted hill '' and `` thirteen ghosts '' . and it 's the same message , so for that , i give it a : 4/10		4		0
1st watched - 4 out of 10 -lrb- verbinski -rrb- : action-packed sequel to the original in an obvious 2nd out of 3 movies in this series . we follow our favorite anti-hero pirate , jack sparrow thru his goofy exploits on the sea as he tries to recover a key to open the chest that houses the actual beating heart of the un-dead computer-animated `` davy jones '' . his reason for recovering it is to pay him back on what he owes him . jones is the leader of a ghostly gang aboard the floating dutchmen that terrorizes the ocean seeking souls to join his undead crew . there are , i think , another 3 or 4 people looking for the same object for different reasons -lrb- all for their own safety i must say -rrb- . the action is definitely almost non-stop with a couple of humorous sets and a couple of good lines from the rolling stones impersonating pirate , played by johnny depp . the problem with this movie is that we know who 's going to make it out of every hair-raising situation so there 's no suspense . and as far as drama , forget about it ... instead we have a few people searching for an elusive trinket to help them out of their own particular predicament and people getting into situations way over their heads for the sake of their own interests . but of course , everything will work out for all of our most popular swashbuckling characters , as long as you keep watching even through the 3rd movie of course . there was definitely a lot of money put into the computer-animated special effects and the choreography of the fight sequences had to take some work , but who really cares ?? in my opinion , this is just another hollywood money-making machine so let 's all join the cause and wait until the 3rd one is available for free somewhere before we watch it ... who 's with me ??		4		0
you know kevin smith did not write this movie , and it shows , because when he does write a movie , there is vulgarity , but there is a charm and purpose behind it , in cop out there is none of that . and the movie could n't decide if it wanted to be a buddy cop comedy or a parody of a buddy cop comedy . the story begins with two cops named jimmy and paul -lrb- bruce willis and tracy morgan -rrb- who have partners for nine years . and are both suspended after a bust goes wrong . but jimmy wants to pay for his daughters wedding , so he tries to sell a valuable baseball card , but then murphy 's law comes in , and he gets robbed himself . so jimmy and paul set off on a mission to get the card back . i hope kevin smith has n't sold out , i really think he will get back on the band wagon . tracy morgan is just awful here , i say give him the right jokes and he can be very funny , but they just do n't do it in this film . it 's like he is just making up his lines up as goes along , he is trying to get the level of charm that eddie murphy had in beverly hills cop -lrb- 1984 -rrb- , but just does n't do it . bruce willis 's annoyance is what i was feeling sitting through it . but this movie had two funny scenes , and that is why i 'm not giving it a totally low rating . but it was still bad .		4		0
wong kar-wai 's first english language film . nora jones stars as elizabeth a young woman who walks into jude laws cafe after her boyfriend dumps her . after several nights there eating blueberry pie she heads off on the road where she meets a cop in memphis and a gambler in nevada . a decidedly uneven mix of a movie that does n't add up to much . kar-wai 's beautiful camera work produces some great images but his some time use of slow motion is over used to the point you 'll want to hit the fast forward so you see something at normal speed . how the film is shot also produces an overly cramped sense . much of the jude law sequence seems to have been shot through the windows of the café and from one angle . the memphis sequence is like that as well . the story about relationships rarely springs to life in more than in fits and starts . its all moments not a whole film . i have no idea why elizabeth goes traveling other than as an excuse to meet the people we meet . it fragments the film and takes us away from the most interesting thing in the film the chats with jude law . the cast is good with the up and down natalie portman in up mode as a gambler who meets norah jones -lrb- fair at the start but gets better as it goes -rrb- in nevada and travels around with her . rachel weisz as the wife of the memphis cop is far from english herself as a woman with a thick southern accent . the joy of the film is the music . this has a stunning soundtrack that drives the film when the writing lets everything else drift . i kept going just to hear the music . the weakest of kar wai 's films i 've seen . there is a good movie in here but it needs to be remade . -lrb- i 'd love to see the jude law bits in a different context -rrb-		4		0
just like heaven finds its audience because of the stars . reese witherspoon , who actually can act as we have seen in vanity fair and walk the line -rrb- , here falls back on her commercial blockbuster successes like legally blonde 1 & 2 , etc. . doubtless films like this one are something she can do in her sleep , and the box office results make it worth her time . but it is a bit disappointing to see mark ruffalo step out of his usual proclivity for choosing films of substance to spend time on fluff like this . the plot is one seen many times before -lrb- ghost , heaven can wait , etc -rrb- : witherspoon is the perfect physician who on the eve of her promotion in the hospital is in a fatal car accident . mark ruffalo is a down and out architect who sublets her apartment only to find witherspoon is a cantankerous unable to believe she is dead , providing lots of banter between the two over who owns what . funny to a point . then the plot twists become even more ludicrous and the story proceeds down the path of romantic resolution , becoming a bit preachy along the way . were is not for the genuine talent of the two stars the film would be a sure cure for insomnia , but witherspoon and ruffalo wring the best parts out of a weak script and actually make the film entertaining in spots . grady harp		4		0
this is a perfect example of why the whole `` war on drugs '' is a total failure and why `` just say no '' and `` dare '' are wastes of time and money . the government believes that we all are total idiots and can be scared into believing their crap . anyone who has ever tried marijuana knows that this film is pure bunk . knowing that the government feels that they can lie to us with impunity , we are less likely to believe anything else they tell us . this is dangerous to those who might try harder drugs as they have been lied to once , and will not heed the warnings given by the same liars . it also means we would tend to ignore things like terrorist threats as the government lies about that also . this film is important as it shows the government can not ever be trusted . other than that it is pure camp and totally hilarious to see how far they will go to lie to us .		4		0
badly dated teen party flick that might have played better in the 1980s . ethan embry goes to a high school graduation party in a private home where he encounters jennifer hewitt , whom he has loved since childhood . he spends most of the movie trying to find a way to approach her . she , on the other hand , has just broken up with the class jock and is besieged at the party by an army of guys looking to hook up . why she stays as long as she does is a mystery , but it makes for a convenient finale when embry finally catches up with her . dullsville . . a more interesting storyline has seth green getting stuck in a bathroom with chubby classmate lauren ambrose . they have never been particularly fond of one another . so they argue and fight , then they make out , then -- well , you will have to see the movie for the rest . but frankly , i would n't bother .		4		0
a novel -lrb- original is far too good a word -rrb- idea that could have made a very good , spooky , mysterious film has instead made a very average , run of the mill horror . `` a nightmare on elm street '' is a real been their before excursion from writer-director wes craven . the cast including heather langenkamp and robert englund can not help the cause . truth be known , all the performances in this `` nightmare '' are hopeless and craven can not even manage a single scare with this lame effort . the only horror achieved is horrific predictability . how on earth did this nonsense become a cult classic ? tuesday , september 17 , 1991 - video		4		0
i was looking for zombie films and came across this . i could n't resist the title . a film from a director that gave us such classics as billy the kid versus dracula and bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla . i ca n't wait to see those . the sound on my copy was terrible . lips moved out of conjunction with words , and sometimes it sounded as if a woman was speaking when it was a man . when the sound got better , it was out of sync with the picture by several minutes . terrible , but i suffered through it for art 's sake . jesse 's -lrb- john lupton -rrb- friend -lrb- cal bolder -rrb- gets shot and he is searching for a doctor , while running from the marshall -lrb- jim davis -rrb- . guess who he finds ? what it 's the granddaughter of dr. frankenstein -lrb- narda onyx -rrb- . also stars spitfire estelita rodriguez as juanita . she dies mysteriously a month before the film was released . she and maria frankenstein are both after jesse 's affections . after sending jesse on a wild goose chase , maria kills his friend and turns him into igor -lrb- the zombie part -rrb- . a sad ending for a truly horribly funny picture .		4		0
this film reminds me of conan so much but is no where near as good . the acting is okay but nothing to scream over . the fight scenes are pretty cool so if you are an action junkie you would definitely like those . it has some really funny scenes also and that is the main thing i like about this film . if you are bored one night take a chance on this film and it will probably remind you of conan too .		4		0
i ca n't hardly wait to take this back to the video store and forget about it . gather ` round your wacky friends , serve up 250 cans of coors , and enjoy this trashy flick until you drop dead on the floor and it 's all over . the life and times surrounding the gen-x culture ignites a spark , and jennifer love hewitt sparkles on occasion , yet she does fairly good , and so scarcely . this movie is beyond ridiculous , overall . making special use of our time is the term `` movie '' that has no definition . it 's a detailed in-depth examination of a night in the life of and perverted young people at a house party doing endless rounds of dumb activity that never blesses the all-important plot . what a terrible shock to see cute , lovable melissa joan hart -lrb- `` clarissa '' , `` sabrina '' -rrb- wasted in something so raucous ! the idea of featuring popular stars in uncredited appearances is n't working , i 'm sorry to say . reality bites is far better , although showing its age . ca n't hardly wait has a couple of good qualities , but nothing really impressed me except for the final fifteen minutes . party 's over ! sony , i have you now ! you 're all mine !		4		0
so , jonny lee miller is an excellent actor as he showed in trainspotting , a movie which gets better every time you see it , but in this thing , he shows that you ca n't make bad material seem good no matter how good you are . dracula 2000 has a cheesy title , a boring , stupid and fairly unsuccessful star -lrb- vitamin c -rrb- in a role which seems to have been designed for her to be seen topless , no suspense and stupid actions scenes . the fact that , to make dracula seem like a tougher foe , the legendary vampire seems to react to none of the traditional anti-vampire products makes it even less fun . what makes this movie almost worth thinking for a few seconds before saying `` oh it 's boring anyway '' is a surprisingly clever twist on dracula 's origin . but since the rest of the movie is pure garbage , you should avoid it anyway , except if you simply need to see every vampire movie ever made . if you want a good vampire movie , see 1992 's dracula or interview with the vampire . and , one last thing ... why is this movie such a shameless add for virgin records ? i mean you see virgin 's logo every minute at least twice ... anyway , the important thing is you should not see this movie if quality is a something you like . 35 %		4		0
having run the gamut of comic heroes from jerry lewis to woody allen and back again during his career , steve martin seems to have settled in this movie for a cut - rate bill murray persona , the faux sentimentality without the sharp edge . as the eponymous bottom - feeding hustler trying to cobble together a movie about an invasion by aliens disguised as raindrops mr martin is in the gutter but looking at the mr eddie murphy cast as a megalomaniac box - office giant with an entourage the size of several small countries who sit around all day laughing at his jokes . clearly this role is not intended to resemble any person , living or dead . he is in thrall to a cult that is also clearly not intended to resemble any cult , living or dead . `` bowfinger '' suffers from trying to ride off in too many directions at once : at the same time it aims for satire , slapstick and social comment . this would be a neat trick indeed if it could be pulled off but sadly the movie 's reach exceeds its grasp quite considerably . mr is to be commended for trying to think outside the box to bring new life to a plot that is less well - worn than many , but ultimately , like most movies about movie making , it 's all a bit like coming upon an isolated community where intermarriage has weakened the strain and mocking the unfortunates living there .		4		0
why keep bothering . just leave the tall man alone . he 's only after the death anyway and it 's not like he 's trying to take over our world our anything like that . besides , it seems to me that he only goes after you once you try to cross his path . but no , the success of the first movie caused this sequel to be made , as well as 2 more . it 's a pretty late sequel , that got released 9 years after the first movie but yet the movie decides on featuring the same child characters from the first movie , even though they are grown ups now and look nothing like the characters out of the first movie , even though they are being played by the same actors . this time the movie had a significantly bigger budget to spend but the movie still remains just as messy to watch as the first movie . i still have no idea what is going on all the time and things seem to happen very randomly . i was just never taken by the story , or any of its action and excitement . also as an horror movie this really falls short . never understood why this movie is being liked so much by horror fans but i guess i 'm just not that into the director/writer of this movie-series . i just found out he also wrote and directed `` '' , which is also a movie that has a real cult following and is being much appreciated but is a movie i just never could get into and did n't enjoyed watching all that much . to me it also really does n't help much that he keeps borrowing heavily from other movies . guess that in don coscarelli 's he is paying homage but to me it just comes across as some lazy writing . also the story as a whole for this movie is being pretty poorly written . like i said , i could n't even understand what was happening half of the time and the characters in this movie just never seem to have a plan or any clear motivations . it makes this movie pretty bad to watch . no , i 'm just not a phan . 4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/		4		0
a man -lrb- sewell -rrb- wakes up in a bath tub , receives a phone call from a stranger -lrb- sutherland -rrb- hysterically urging him to depart the premises pronto , runs out into the night-time streets , and is pursued by mysterious figures in black fedoras and long black overcoats , as well as a detective -lrb- hurt -rrb- who believes him to be a serial killer . later he runs into a woman -lrb- connelly -rrb- who claims to be his wife but he has no memory of her . -lrb- i 'd remember her . -rrb- sewell , in fact , has no memory of anything at all from his past . out on the shabby city streets , surrounded by ominous and immensely tall buildings , sewell is astounded . he ca n't tell what time period he 's in because the cars are from the 40s and 50s . there are a few other people about but they all fall asleep at the same instant , no matter what they 're doing at the time . it 's always night . the sun never rises . and he runs through the alleys , hides in niches , clambers over roof tops , always pursued by either the cadaverous men in black clothes or by the relentless and humorless cop . later , he 'll see the buildings reshape themselves in a few minutes , the city changing its face . i do n't know if i want to give away what 's going on . it would be difficult in any case because the plot is so full of twists and turns and so many of the events inexplicable . i 'll say it has something to do with aliens experimenting with human reactions to staged circumstances . it 's all the product of a wild imagination -- alex proyas was the director and writer of the screenplay . i gather he 'd opened the film with an explanation of what was up by kiefer sutherland , the mad scientist . it might have made for a less surprising but more comprehensible movie . as it is , all those dark scenes and paranoia depressed me . it was like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle , only the individual pieces were all drawn from different pictures and did n't fit together . even at the end -- after the earth-shattering cgi confrontation , considerable doubt was left about what had just happened and what was going to happen . i kind of like stories about the mysterious transformation of people , events , and things , but i prefer them to be rooted in some kind of reality i can get hold of . imagination is one thing ; chaos is another . when literally anything can happen at any time , there is no longer room for surprise . give me `` the invasion of the body snatchers '' or `` being john malkovitch '' . and i hope i never live to see another exploding head .		4		0
i saw independence day twice in the cinema during the summer of 1996 . the first time , i thought it was action packed , with stunning special effects with fantastic set pieces like new york and washington d.c. being blown to pieces by the invading aliens . then i had to see it again . this time i went with some friends . when i walked out after the second showing i realised that the film was disaster rubbish with sit com comedy dominating the entire feature . the proof is in the daft stereotypes . jeff goldblum takes the film seriously for about five minutes -lrb- during the arrival of the massive ships over the new york skyline -rrb- after that as far as goldblum 's concerned its laurel and hardy time with will smith 's fighter pilot when they team up at the end to take on the mother ship . then there is will smith . the director must have just said to smith ` just be yourself ' meaning fresh prince of bel air in a military uniform . smith is much better in men in black -lrb- a real comedy -rrb- and the excellent i , robot so it is a shame he just made his character into a complete parody of the hero . special mention must go to randy quaid for playing one of the most annoying characters in movie history . rand 's character is to this film what jar jar binks was to the later star wars prequel the phantom menace . the potential to make a great invasion thriller with measured humour and stunning thrills and chills is lost amid silly comic capers and daft one liners between insipid characters . id4 made a lot of money but for me -lrb- and my friends -rrb- it was one of the biggest letdowns of 1996 .		4		0
grotesque effects and the star presence of christopher lee do little more than salve the wounds these `` scars '' will leave on the average audience -- for gothic horror fans equipped with a dose of patience only . a few moments are exciting , but the script is not subtle , its characters unconvincingly foolish . dracula 's servant does a bit to lighten things up with memorable acting . the plot and story are very predictable -lrb- basically the only `` plot '' is a series of people coming and going from dracula 's castle , in search of the first missing visitor -rrb- . ok direction , but more care should have been taken in editing out the boring parts -lrb- perhaps before production began -rrb- . poor results .		4		0
universal at some point figured out the way to cash in on their established horror franchises was to do a mash-up of them . so they come up with some contrived reason for the wolfman and the frankenstein monster to have not only survived their previous demises , but somehow managed to meet up . what we get is the first of three movies with lawrence talbot -lrb- played by an increasingly alcoholic lon chaney jr. -rrb- whining about how he wants to die . the monster is given the short shrift in this film , becoming less important in sequels . here , he 's played by bela lugosi , who had refused the original role and allowed boris karloff to get greater stardom . the casting almost made sense . lugosi played ygor in the previous two films and ygor 's brain ended up in the monster at the end of the last movie . in the original script , the monster had dialog and was blind , just like he was in the previous film . all these elements are lost . the good guy doctor in this movie for no good reason decides he needs to bring the monster to full power . this sets up the short , uninteresting fight scene between a recharged monster and a wolfman .		4		0
when watching this movie , with it 's deterministic cause and effect , wall-to-wall clichés and hackneyed sentiment , can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how barrie 's life played out ? you watch it in a posture of disagreement . hollywood biopics are n't based on the individual lives anymore , they 're just rewrites of previously successful biopics . if hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you 'd barely recognize your own story . any personal complexity would be obliterated by some , simplistic backstory . your story would resemble `` rocky '' because it 's the only hollywood knows how to produce anymore . we could n't leave the audience pondering anything left open-ended as they exit . this movie does n't trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them . i perceived the captain reference eons before the movie it for me . i could see the 25 kids twist coming for days . this is a completely average movie . not horrible but not great . hence it 's likely to be showered with a few oscars next year . there 's nothing the academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years . from the new yorker article `` lost boys '' by anthony lane : `` arthur llewelyn davies , also adored his boys , and it may be unfair of `` finding neverland '' to omit him , for streamlining purposes , from the scene ; by the time that johnny depp meets kate winslet , she is already a widow , whereas arthur was very much alive when barrie first entered the consciousness -- and , little by little , the home -- of the llewellyn davies family . `` finding neverland '' is a weepie . from the moment that barrie met george and jack , and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal , the story is sad , but the reality is even more dismal : 1907 -- arthur llewellyn davies dies from cancer of the jaw . 1910 -- sylvia dies of lung cancer . the five boys are orphaned ; barrie is made their guardian . 1915 -- george is killed in the first world war , fighting with his regiment in flanders . 1921 -- michael , an undergraduate at oxford , is drowned while swimming with a friend . the two bodies , when recovered , are found clinging together . on april 5 , 1960 , peter llewellyn davies , by then an esteemed publisher , threw himself under a subway train in london . we should not presume to read a mind in torment , but we may note in passing that , if he had lived another month , he would have reached the centenary of barrie 's birth and thus , one imagines , a fresh flurry of interest in `` peter pan '' -- `` that terrible masterpiece , '' in the words of peter llewellyn davies .		4		0
is this supposed to be a comedy ? that appears to be the intention of director , ben stiller , and jim carrey the principle actor . but the movie is not funny . not because the jokes fall flat , jim carrey does some insanely funny schticks , but because the subject matter is not laughable . in the movie , carrey plays chip , a cable installer with a very unstable psychology , who becomes fixated on one of his customers , steve , a yuppie played by mathew broderick . for free cable , steve agrees to become the cable guys new friend and buddy . but as steve soon realizes , the cable guy is a stalker , injecting himself , not just into steve 's life , but into that of steve 's girlfriend and his family . but these guys all love the adorable chip . steve 's the only one that realizes a dangerous psychosis lurks in chip 's head . and this situation is played for laughs ! stiller could have used the same material and made a thriller to much better effect . as it is , it 's a misfire , and a waste of talent .		4		0
being a fan of the 1952 film , i was pumped to see this , especially after reading a few reviews which raved about it . wow , what a letdown . yes , part of the reason i was so disappointed with this was that it bore little resemblance to biography of artist toulouse-lautrec which was the centerpiece of the classic film . later , when i was informed that this movie was not intended to be a re-make but a totally new movie with its own story , i felt a little better and watched the movie again . sorry , but it still sucked ! oh , the visuals were great , especially in the beginning of the movie . i loved all the color and wild visuals in that first 20 minutes , but that was it . after that , it settled into a frustrating love story and the bogged down drastically the rest of the way . as for the music , there are too many slow numbers sung by mediocre singers like nicole kidman and ethan hawke , the two romantic interests in the film . they were n't bad singers , but so-so was n't good enough for a major motion picture production like this . and , being a big fan of toulouse-lautrec 's artwork and fascinating history , i did n't appreciate him being shown as a clownish character . that was disgusting , and really tells you about this film . as they say , `` too bad ; this could have been so much better . '' all they needed was an entirely new script .		4		0
there should have been a real epiphany of a tremendous script to be even considered for a reboot of successful trilogy which ended not too long ago . the story does n't waver much from the original , special effects look the same though it left me in awe the first time around , and the dialogues that seem to be later imposed over the action sequences felt terrible . i became an admirer of marc webb for his stupendous ' -lrb- 500 -rrb- days of summer ' , but this one came out extremely underwhelming with an uncooked script and an inconsistent screenplay . peter parker -lrb- andrew garfield -rrb- is left in the care of his uncle ben -lrb- martin sheen -rrb- and aunt may -lrb- sally field -rrb- when his parents die . he is the same , gets bullied in school and invisible with the girls . when he comes across his father 's research by accident , he decides to pay a visit to his father 's old friend dr. curt connors -lrb- rhys ifans -rrb- . dr. connors is currently experimenting on cross species genetics in an attempt make limbs regrow using the dna of a lizard . when parker is bitten by a spider when he accidentally steps into a chamber full of them , he senses something is not ` right ' with him . it is too difficult and too recent to judge this movie on its own without referring to its predecessor . there really was no sense in rebooting the franchise with the material in hand for any artistic value . marc webb even blundered in his strength - romance and screenplay though emma stone does an excellent gwen stacy to keep it floating compared to an equally brilliant and slightly dark mj by kirsten dunst . andrew garfield could have made a better peter parker but crushed by the insensitive handling of the moments on his reaction to the suddenness of the super power . martin sheen was an excellent inclusion who adds tremendous value to uncle ben 's character . there is no sense of surprise by any character except for emma stone 's gwen stacy when they realize peter parker is spider-man which was baffling . insensitive , undercooked and unnecessary . better watch the original again		4		0
i had no desire to see this in the theater , because i thought it would just be a bunch of old men on stage butchering their classic songs from 30 years ago . but the reviews by the professional critics were so laudatory , that i figured i had to give it a shot when it came onto dvd . so what did i see ? a bunch of old men on stage butchering their classic songs from 30 years ago . why was this film so well-received ? someone can still think that the stones are one of the greatest rock 'n roll bands ever , yet still question why a film like this was made . were the majority of film critics oblivious to this distinction , or were they just trying to be hip ? bjorn borg is one of my favorite all-time tennis players , but do i really want to see him playing tennis in his 50 's ? nope .		4		0
i 've seen jurassic park probably five or six times , and each time i hope i 'll like it better than the last , and i never do . a perfectly wonderful book by michael crichton is given the ` spielberg ' treatment and aside from the wonderful special effects , betrayed badly . where to begin ? first and foremost , one of spielberg 's worst tendencies is to find annoying personal characteristics endearing . the two children are n't precocious and charming , they 're little brats , no matter how hard the director tries to paint them otherwise . the character of john hammond , in the book , was as i recall a rather devious , unscrupulous man ; here , he is portrayed as a cheerful , slightly ditsy , misguided santa claus . and laura dern manages to almost single-handedly sink this movie . her perpetual `` i do n't know whether to laugh or cry '' expression is probably the single most irritating element in a film full of them . and everyone smiles way too much . spielberg , for all his supposed genius , also delivers some of the most excruciating action and danger scenes on record . whenever one of the human characters is in a spot , it is inevitably his or her own stupid fault . they ca n't lock the door , they wo n't turn the flashlight off , they 're too scared to jump off the fence , they ca n't run fast enough ... every damn scene is like this , to where you want to reach into the screen and slap the hell out of them . sam neill comes off best , in what is really a thankless role as the straight man for all this nonsense . but he 's dragged down by the same sappy script . well , what about those special effects , you might ask ? yes , the dinosaurs are spectacular and very believable -lrb- much more so than the humans really -rrb- and they are the only reason i 'm giving this four stars out of ten . in 1993 , we were still being blown away by filmmakers constantly upping the ante when it came to mind-blowing effects and sure enough , jurassic park was state-of-the-art when it came out . since then , i daresay people have become more blase about such things as they have become more routine . to be fair , there are some wonderful sequences in jurassic park and it 's certainly worth seeing at least once . i suppose ultimately that is the most maddening thing about it ; it could have been so much better , not just another summer blockbuster , but a truly great motion picture . it 's a real shame that it 's not .		4		0
i went to see thiz movie with no expectation . i think all things that they want to show us , it has already appeared in the first movie . so thiz `` squeakquel '' is only a repetition of what we have seen before . the movie is still played by jason lee and david cross . the alvin character is voiced by justin long . the former director tim hill who also directed `` garfield '' -lrb- 2004 -rrb- now is replaced by betty thomas . it 's very obvious that the moviemaker 's intention is to refresh things up by the appearance of new characters , the -lrb- the girl 's version of the chipmunks -rrb- . members of the are brittany -lrb- christina applegate -rrb- , jeanette -lrb- anna faris -rrb- , eleanor -lrb- amy poehler -rrb- . we certainly recognize the trio as creditable comediennes . i think in some ways , the movie is less musical than the first one . it looks like the performance is based on the nowadays hip hop 's style . if we look at the human characters , zachary levi seems to have more proportion than jason lee , both of them do n't make us stunned by their performances . their roles can be replaced easily by other actors . in the end , i have to say that thiz kind of movie is definitely just for fun . visit my blog on jonny 's movee : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com		4		0
nick cassavetes directs this glorification of the true life story of one of the youngest people ever wanted by the fbi . emile hirsch plays drug dealer johnny truelove . he comes from a very well off family , owns his own home , several cars and numerous sycophants . actually johnny is idolized by his suburbanite posse . there is the dolt elvis -lrb- shawn hatosy -rrb- and the burnt out frankie -lrb- justine timberlake -rrb- . jake -lrb- ben foster -rrb- is a druggie that shorts him in a pot transaction . the speed freak jake on the debt ; so the powerful and privileged johnny has jake 's 15-year-old brother zack -lrb- anton yelchin -rrb- kidnapped and held as a marker . it becomes obvious the debt wo n't be paid any time soon . when johnny and closer followers realize they 're subject to doing long hard time behind bars for kidnapping ; they consider the options : return zack or off him . this film gives timberlake the chance to strip his shirt off , show tattoos and partake of the drugs that comes with the territory . plus his mouth could n't be much fouler . all said , justin probably does the best acting in this chaotic flick . also in the cast are bruce willis , sharon stone , dominique swain , laura , regina rice , olivia wilde and harry dean stanton .		4		0
scary movie adds a new element to the usual *** movie formula - reality . a few scenes from the dubya administration 's history are reproduced , and an embarrassing moment from mr cruise 's midlife crisis are re-lived in addition to the usual spoofs of various horror and sci fi films . the dubya scenes , nicely done by leslie nielson , were the highlights of the film for me . i 'm not a fan of brainless comedy , but this non-formula material made the film tolerable for me . sm4 spends a lot of time with the village , saw and war of the worlds - plus a couple of films i only vaguely recognized ... blending the plots cleverly but without adding much to the comedic value in the blending technique . brokeback mountain is also parodied -lrb- though i do not understand why this was considered a scary movie -rrb- . the film is funny at times , but brow-beats its parody of tom cruise 's character in war of the worlds . nevertheless , it 's a fun little romp and much less grotesque than some of the previous entries in the series . acting - good for what it is . directing - good for what it is . script - ok , but could have been more intellectually challenging -lrb- and funnier -rrb- cinematography - good for what it is . recommended for fans of the series , but do n't expect it to be the funniest .		4		0
far be it from me to point these things out -lrb- my own ratman is a cross between the shadow , zorro , and batman -rrb- , but this latest version of the beast of yucca flats is n't much better than the previous one . in coleman francis 's original -lrb- which quite clearly inspired stan lee and jack kirby -rrb- , tor johnson -lrb- `` a prehistoric beast in the nuclear age , '' according to francis himself -rrb- limps through the desert -lrb- `` a hundred and ten in the shade - and no shade , '' francis the narrator intones - no doubt remembering those long , hot days in the desert getting it all on film -rrb- after having been transformed by a nuclear explosion into a lumbering hulk . time had clearly taken its toll on johnson , but there he was , lurching around in his ragged shirt , making inarticulate growling noises . at one point , vice-presidential wannabe -lrb- and real life stepford wife -rrb- sarah `` six pack '' palin puts in an appearance . it did n't save the movie -lrb- nor will it save the republican party -rrb- , but at least the beast of yucca flats was an honest attempt at telling the story of the incredible hulk of yucca flats .		4		0
this film is about two men working for a organ transplant corporation , who take back the organs from people not keeping up with their installments . `` repo men '' is technically well made , but has an awful script . the film starts off as a sci-fi action film that appears credible . however , the action is too infrequent and too short-lived , and the pace is too slow . i was thoroughly bored by 30 minutes . then , the film becomes a senseless slasher violence film . it is a bit like `` from dusk till dawn '' but without the style or coolness . the ending , mixed with sex and gore , is downright ridiculous . am i expected to believe that or entertained by that ? further still , just when you thought the film is ending , the real ending twist comes in . this ending twist is no good either , and ruins the film . i wish the film just stopped before the ending twist , so that the film could be half decent .		4		0
a boring , and utterly messy retelling of mary shelly 's classic story sees kenneth branaugh as the mad scientist frankenstein -lrb- guffaw -rrb- and robert de niro as the monster he has created . interesting in some areas , but overall branaugh 's love of himself gets in the way of the film 's narrative . remind me never to watch a film that shows robert de niro 's rear for over five seconds ever again . branaugh 's at-the-time girlfriend , helena bonham carter , and john cleese co-star . 2.5 / 5 stars - john ulmer		4		0
this is one of those movies that probably should have been a straight to dvd movie but since it has a well known actor or actress with a bit more budget so makes it into theaters . if you seen the trailer you know exactly which direction it 's going to go and can predict just about everything that is going to happen . and if your a movie buff that has seen these types of movies before can guess and be right about it . there is few subplot characters that does n't really add much to the story at all . except one for one violent scene and the other for a sexy nude scene . but i guess that somewhat adds to something to a movie like this but very very slightly . there is quite a bit of 3d in this movie where things fly at the audiences and stuff which might be the only reason to see this movie in the theaters . some reviewers and critics seem to compare this to `` abraham lincoln : vampire hunter '' but seemed more like `` van helsing '' with hugh jackman . it 's alright seeing it once but nothing really stands out about this movie including the action . i give it a 4 though since it rips off of one of terry gilliam 's film `` the brothers grimm '' too much . 4/10		4		0
in a year when there has been some odd films , films that are not easy to explain -lrb- shutter island , black swan , inception etc. . -rrb- , i thought i was on safe ground watching a good old fashioned alfred hitchcock thriller but little did i know this is just as unexplainable as any of those films i have named . vertigo is sometimes called '' hitchcock 's masterpiece '' but i do n't see it . this is a long ponderous movie that makes very little sense and treats the viewer with contempt . jimmy stewart is watchable but his character is not very believable and the relationship with kim novak is confusing and annoying . i much prefer rear window or psycho to this movie and to be perfectly honest i could n't wait for it to finish .		4		0
this movie got unusually mean reviews . it is an average movie - it deserves neither scorn , nor adulation . i enjoyed it but it does n't offer too much that would cause me to watch it again . it 's a reasonable effort . instead of altering the ripper case willy-nilly to suit their needs , only small changes have been made -lrb- they dismiss all but one ripper letter -rrb- . so it was nice to see the actual clues of the case appear and be assembled into a coherent storyline ; even though the prince edward explanation has been discredited . the envisioning of victorian london is fresh , and the film technique which suggests the passing of time over crime scenes is fine . so it ends up being less dumb than i imagined . jack the ripper is wearing the wrong hat though . -lrb- witnesses describe a man in a deerstalker cap , not an opera-style -rrb- heather graham is a strange piece of casting for a role that requires a decent accent , and the revisions to victorian culture itself are absurd . the culture is depicted as having very contemporary , relaxed morals : annie is a whore ; you do n't sit in a garden , or visit the victoria and albert museum with a whore in 1888 . and you just are n't seen in public with anyone but your wife , or there 's a scandal . oh , mary can read !? unlikely . mary has improbable middle-class values and behavior . she 'd more likely be a nasty , unwashed , ignorant , uncultured , drunk , guttersnipe ; as ripper 's victims were . the lamest part of the movie is that it hints at two or three options for who might be jack , then selects the culprit you suspected the first second he was introduced -lrb- gee ... that was underwhelming ! -rrb- and the idea that an underground society actually meets underground -lrb- ! -rrb- is um , quaint . after seeing sweeney todd for the first time this week , burtons ' effort looks even less original or thoughtful than i previously granted . all he did was glance at this earlier depp vehicle ; borrow the whole production and add the songs . heather even ends up living `` by the sea !

i picked up this movie based on the dvd cover alone . it looked interesting and it said `` disturbing '' , `` scary as hell '' , `` one of the most perverse , deranged and original horror movies in years '' . so it sounded to be a rather good movie . then i sat down to watch it , and now that i have , i am left with the sense of having been cheated profoundly . this movie was nowhere near as interesting as the european dvd cover looked like . i thought i was in for a zombie movie , not a movie about a bunch of necrophiliac teenagers going at it with a corpse in a basement . sure , the idea for the movie is fresh and weird , disturbing to some perhaps . but to me , no , not so much . nothing much happened throughout the movie , and my interest and attention span started drifting . i had genuinely hoped for more zombie action and more blood and guts . one thing that was working well for the movie was the cast . they had some fairly good actors and actresses on the list here . most memorable was noah segan -lrb- playing jt -rrb- and jenny spain -lrb- playing the deadgirl -rrb- . now , i am not saying that the others were not good , far from it . they were actually all doing a good job . just that segan and spain were the ones with the most impressive performances . the effects in the movie were also alright , and despite there was only little blood and gore in the movie , that which was there worked really well . especially the scene with johnny -lrb- played by andrew dipalma -rrb- in the bathroom . i loved that scene . just a shame that it was only a brief flash and that it was so short a scene . `` deadgirl '' scored well on the original story , but it was dragged down by a slow pace , lack of scares and thrills , and an overall lack of promising what the dvd cover promised . for a horror movie , `` deadgirl '' is a rather tame experience , but the story might just actually make it worth a watch , if you have n't already seen it . just do n't expect to be scared , and do n't expect a lot of zombies !		4		0
ok , so i was one of those people who actually enjoyed the first alvin . i know it was predictable , terribly acted and lacking in substance , but i liked it nonetheless . the squeakquel not so much . there 's no effort to even mask the predictability in this one , the filmmakers just concede to the fact there are no surprises . the acting is noticeably worse , jason lee essentially being replaced by the far less appealing zachary levi is the main contributor to this problem . and worst of all the shallowness of the plot ca n't be redeemed by numerous hit songs getting ` ' , like achieved by its predecessor . the major upside to the movie is still the song and dance numbers , which are turned up to eleven thanks to the arrival of the chipettes . brittany , jeanette and eleanor -lrb- voiced by applegate , faris and poehler respectively -rrb- provide two things : firstly , a reason for more girls to watch , secondly , and most importantly , the chance for the film to include female tunes . its these ` cute girl ' routines which provide the bulk of the enjoyment as alvin , simon and theodore 's music acts become tired very fast . of particular annoyance to me is something that has become increasingly popular in hollywood : big names being vocally unrecognisable . it occurred in the first alvin and then again most recently in planet 51 . why oh why would you use well-known actors if you ca n't tell it 's them ? does n't that defeat the purpose of having them at all ? any old person can have their voice synthesised digitally to sound like a chipmunk , is it purely so their names can be included on the poster and in the trailer ? well , it is a real shame , because if i lured in talent like long , poehler and faris i would make more out of it than name-dropping . 2 out of 5 -lrb- 1 - rubbish , 2 - ordinary , 3 - good , 4 - excellent , 5 - classic -rrb-		4		0
vampires do n't give interviews . at least , vampires in their traditional transylvanian form do n't . imagine count dracula in one of those old hammer horrors going off to hold a press conference with someone from the daily mail or the bbc . the title of `` interview with the vampire '' , therefore , suggests that it will be a vampire story with a modern setting , perhaps something like `` the hunger '' . in fact , although the film opens in modern-day san francisco , it is not as modern as its title might suggest . it starts with a man named louis being interviewed by a reporter named daniel malloy . louis claims to have been born in louisiana in the late eighteenth century and to have been converted to vampirism by the vampire lestat in 1791 . the film then chronicles the adventures of louis , lestat and a young girl named claudia , whom they also transform into a vampire , over the next two centuries , starting in the new orleans of the 1790s , passing through the paris of the 1870s and ending up in the america of the late twentieth century . in the course of the film we learn several interesting facts about vampires . they are , apparently , ageless , and remain the age they were when the first became a vampire . thus claudia still has the outward appearance of an nine-year-old girl even when , by rights , she should be in her eighties , and louis looks remarkably well preserved for a . `` ageless '' , however , does not necessarily mean `` immortal '' , and there are in fact various ways of killing them besides the traditional method , notably exposing them to direct sunlight . we also learn that vampires need blood to survive ; animal blood will do , but they far prefer human blood . louis -lrb- much to lestat 's contempt -rrb- initially has a conscience about killing humans , but eventually gives in and kills his housemaid . as for claudia , she is a bloodthirsty little monster from the start . there is another difference between `` interview with the vampire '' and those old hammer films , quite apart from its protagonist 's willingness to speak to the press . hammer films had their faults , but at least they had a strong sense of morality . the vampires were the bad guys and those humans like van helsing who were brave enough to stand up to them were the good guys . there is none of that in `` interview '' . humans do not really play much part in the story , except as victims . apart from louis ' brief struggle with his conscience , morals do not play much of a role either . vampires kill humans , and that is that . it is this very amorality which is the reason why -lrb- or , more precisely , one of the reasons why -rrb- this film is so difficult to like . certainly , the vampires suffer from enough emotional angst to keep a regiment of agony aunts busy on a full-time basis , but it is hard to sympathise with the emotional problems of creatures who regard the entire human race simply as a convenient source of tasty nourishment . rather surprisingly , the best acting comes from the then child star kirsten dunst , twelve at the time of filming , who gives a very mature and assured performance as claudia . indeed , it was a much more mature and adult performance than many of those which kirsten has given since she became an adult - and certainly better than those given by her adult co-stars in this film . for someone regarded as one of the biggest names in hollywood , brad pitt has appeared in a depressingly large number of indifferent or downright bad films -lrb- `` a river runs through it '' , `` the devil 's own '' , `` ocean 's twelve '' , `` mr and mrs smith '' , etc -rrb- . `` interview with the vampire '' is another to add to this catalogue , although i have to say that he was better here than tom cruise , an actor whose acting varies even more alarmingly between the sublime , the adequate and the ridiculous . cruise 's hilariously over-the-top performance as lestat must count as one of his worst . the script is generally pretty cheesy , but it is normally cruise who gets the purest specimens of over-ripe gorgonzola . -lrb- `` whining coward of a vampire that prowls the night killing rats and poodles ; you could have finished us both '' -rrb- . to describe this sort of dialogue as melodramatic would be to wrong the writers of melodramas . indeed , there is much about the whole film that could be described as hilariously over the top . like a number of other reviewers i was struck by the obvious homo-erotic overtones to the relationship between louis and lestat , especially as tom cruise seemed to be doing his best to milk this aspect as much as he could . more disturbing were the overtones to the relationship between louis and claudia . their feelings for one another seemed to verge on paedophilia , and the mutual dislike between claudia and lestat to be rooted in sexual jealousy . the tone of the entire film is one of camp grand guignol , with blood being spilt by the bucketful . the worst , and silliest , part came during the scenes set in paris , where louis and claudia come across a coven of theatrical vampires who specialise in dispatching their human victims under cover of a theatrical performance , without any of their audience realising what is going on . it was at this point that i realised that , for all neil jordan 's arty direction , the film had abandoned any claim to be taken seriously and had turned into little more than a video nasty with pretensions . 4/10		4		0
when the remake of `` the hills have eyes '' was success financially and amongst horror fans it seemed like the only inevitability in the vast universe was that a sequel would be made . however , this sequel is just as empty as it is bloody . literally every bit of suspense , drama and atmosphere that made it 's predecessor so intense is gone at the expense of violence and gore . the films very first scene is a disturbing child birth meant to shock and repulse and it only gets more lurid from there . the trapped protagonists here are not a family , but armed soldiers and that means guns and that means more violence for the sake of violence . the film could easily have taken more time to set up some eeriness , after all , being stalked by mutant killers is n't exactly a calming thought , but it is hard to be scared from a horror that relies solely on loud noises for its scares . the fact that the mutants yell and scream as they slaughter people one by one will leave you thinking just how could they even get close to trained soldiers unnoticed with all that noise . there is plenty of material here that could have made for a truly disturbing horror film with undertones of nuclear holocaust , but this is not it . this is just something repulsive that was quickly rushed from the hollywood cookie cutter . the rape scene sets a new low in bad taste and shows today 's audience 's blood-thirst for sensationalist horror that 's devoid of anything intelligent in the genre . -- 4/10 bscdb classification : 18 + -- violence/gore , brutality		4		0
well harry potter is in his fifth year at hogwarts and these time they will have to face the fact that voldemort is on the strike again , despite the fact that the minister does n't want to recognize this . well , it is interesting to remark the fact that , as long as the books are better the movies are worse . in the fourth one , we only saw the tournament and well it was not bad , these time there 's a bunch of things that happen together in the book and the movie does n't focus in any of them , then , there 's no concrete plot , as the movie wants to tell lots of things but tells any . none of the stories are well developed and it i hard to follow how the movie goes . in addition , the special effects , that used to be impressive , this time are just invisible , there 's almost any scene where they are the most little astonishing . only the fight in the is decent , but we have seen lots of this before . unluckily for potter 's fan , this movie is not good , i hope that the next are better . anyway , is harry potter , it is still enjoyable .		4		0
boogeyman had it all an original story , good characters , good acting , creepy images , effective jump scares and then came the brutal ending complete with a cgi boogeyman and an abrupt ending that explained nothing makes boogeyman a huge let was doing so well it kept building up , and building up only to crash down harder than ever into my patented crap o was so interesting and i was right into it i thought finally a really good non re-made horror film but that damn ending spoiled it all.the boogeyman is not scary he 's cgi and not even good cgi he 's gameboy advance cgi which means cheesy , and even makes cartoony noise and sounds and boogeyman soon becomes absolutely was extremely disappointed because what seemed to be a great and fresh story ended up being a steaming pile sitting atop my crap o boogeyman you had it and you lost it.overall a good movie turns into a brutally bad movie thanks to the last ten agonizing minutes .		4		0
the only thing i can see with this film getting any attention at all is because of the fact that it is the first colour film of all time , yes i admit that is a big achievement in cinema and changed the direction of cinema however that is about everything that 's going for it . i know i might actually get bashed for this , i might even be called one of those `` mtv mcdonalds people that just say they do n't like it because they are stupid '' , or something like that . i am very reasonable and i will say if you like this movie that 's your opinion but i have seen this the whole way through and here is my opinion . unlike other reviews i will not share the plot because almost everybody has seen this . the actors in this to me overacted actors like margret hamilton , judy garland , bert lahr , frank morgan and ... well pretty much most of the actors in this entire movie were not good actors , more the opposite really , rather that all of the characters seem flat when trying to play whatever role they got to the point where i wanted to turn it off , if they did such good performances then what other performances of theirs have you seen aside from this . now here is another paragraph attacking a small part , the munchkin singing . the strange voices that they used got me a headache during watching , that song was also long for it 's benefit , it 's celebrating and rewarding dorothy for killing a witch unintentionally and then says to go to the wizard of oz . the use of the effects made everything look bright and happy , even the witch 's enchanted castle , with the visual effects and sets made oz look brighter and happier than anything i 'd seen , from a point of view this makes it look fake , people might say `` well that 's what it 's supposed to be '' the genre of this film is a , there are many films out of these genres that i have seen that do n't use this much bright colours . look i realise this is a film from everybody 's childhood but i just am going my way with these reviews , i am not trolling i am only here to say my opinion .		4		0
harold & kumar go to white castle burger is n't very funny at all . it has it 's moments , but it 's just like dude , where 's my car 2 . the jokes are very stupid to anyone who is n't as high as robert downey , jr. on new year 's eve . but the one thing that kind of attracts you to the film is the amazing screen presence of the two stars . for some reason , if they even are n't being funny they interest you , and reel you in . the cameos in harold and kumar go to white castle are numerous . ranging from the star of the jamie kennedy show as a pervert in the woods , to law & order : svu 's christopher meloni as a redneck who wants to get harold and kumar in a four way between him and his unexpectedly attractive wife . also , most surprising is neil patrick harris as himself . harris is portrayed as a sex-crazed drunken loser constantly on experimental drugs -lrb- which i believe is n't really what he is like in real life . -rrb- fred willard too has a cameo , as the admissions officer at harvard university -- quite a change from his role in best in show as the lax , and crude dog show host . i said harold & kumar is n't very funny and it is not . except in about three parts of the movie . those three parts are absolutely hysterical , but again ca n't make up for the whole movie . very often in harold & kumar you 'll find yourself not so much interested in the story , but interested in who will appear in the next cameo performance . in conclusion , harold & kumar is nothing more than average . i would definitely wait for video , or hbo . people 's over twenty-five will mostly find it stupid . hell , i 'm 14 and i find it stupid . -lrb- review written -rrb- grade : c -lrb- screened at amc deer valley 30 , phoenix arizona -rrb-		4		0
i finally saw 2001 : a space oddysey about a month ago after almost a lifetime of hearing how great it was . how it changed the art of cinema , and is stanley kubrick 's magnum opus . then a little bit before i watched it , i saw the review by confused matthew . confused matthew , for those who do n't know , is an internet reviewer who mostly reviews movies that he did n't like , that the did like , examples include : back to the future part 2 , the lion king , no country for old men , minority report , and this . normally i disagree with him , but unfortuantly this time i agreed , while 2001 : a space oddysey is no where near terrible , it is probably one of the most over rated movies i 've ever seen . really the best way i can review this film is to just tell you to go watch matthew 's review , because he pretty much says what i think . now i do agree that this film did change cinema in terms of direction , visuals , all that . this truly is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen , had i never known , i never would 've guessed that this movie was made in 1968 . kubrick is a great director , and now that i 've seen a some of his movies , i can consider him one of my favorites . but really , the best way to describe this movie is `` empty . '' i literally fast forwarded through an hour of this movie , i nearly fell asleep twice , and it is because half of the movie is just spaceships flying across space , looking at landscape , people walking around . and sure , the visuals look nice , but look at the six star wars movies , they looked nice , and they actually had plots . even though i fast forwarded through an hour of a 2 hour 14 minute movie , i did n't miss anything . they go to jupiter , the hal 9000 goes crazy , kills most of the crew , then bowman goes through the stargate finds himself as an old man and then turns into a fetus . what does it all mean ? you know what , i could n't care less . sure hal was pretty cool , but he really was only in about minutes of the movie . yes , i know that i 'm pretty much repeating what confused matthew said , and i tried to give it a chance , i even came on to right after watching it and saying it was basically ok . yes , the visuals are amazing , but if you want to see a really good kubrick movie , go see the shining , that 's a brilliant movie . hell , go see a clockwork orange , it was weird , but good , i think . full metal jacket , sure the first half is far better than the second , but at least stuff happens in that second half . i know that this film is loved by millions of people , and to be honest , i do n't hate the film , but i do n't see myself ever watching it again . if you like it good for you , but i 'm with matthew on this one .		4		0
`` vanilla sky '' is not an easy film to like , an art film disguised as an event film . i 'd argue that a project like this is the sort of thing that should be what we consider an ` event , ' because it 's actually interesting . whatever your opinion of this film is , it 's worth a discussion . being a star is about many things -- , mystery , attraction , but probably most of all , trust . that is , audiences feel ` safe ' going to a tom cruise film -- any tom cruise film . when will people ever learn ? consider three of cruise 's last four films , `` magnolia , '' `` eyes wide shut , '' and now `` vanilla sky . '' none of the trio are exactly audience pleasers -lrb- personally , i hated `` mission : impossible 2 '' -rrb- . they 're odd , intricate pieces featuring odd , intricate characters . like `` eyes wide shut , '' `` sky '' comes wrapped in a nice package . the former : stanley kubrick 's last film and another pairing of wife nicole kidman ; the latter : camerons crowe and diaz , plus the -lrb- arguably -rrb- rising penelope cruz . with this kind of star power , many filmgoers willingly enter `` sky '' knowing next to nothing about what they 're in for . they 're usually the first ones to hurl their super-size buckets of popcorn at the screen in anguish halfway through . no popcorn became airborne at the screening i attended . there was , however , a couple near me who insisted on talking to each other through the entire second half of the movie . normally this would annoy me a great deal . ` this better start making sense real fast , ' the girl would say to her companion . he would try to explain what was going on perhaps not realizing we could hear every word of it . in this particular instance , i ca n't say i blame this girl , whoever she was . personally , i 've never asked myself ` what the heck is going on ? ' more in a film than i did during `` vanilla sky . '' the only incentive to keep watching was cruise , who gives one of his best performances . as for the story , all is revealed eventually , but it takes a major test of patience to get there . this is the point for me where having seen alejandro amenabar 's `` open your eyes '' would have been helpful , but i 'll do my best . having seen his really , really great film `` the others , '' however , will do for now . it provides the example i need to illustrate my point . `` others '' is recognizable as a ghost story and makes sense , whether you know what 's really going on or not . you understand the themes that are being presented . depending on how observant you are , you may even be able to predict the ending before amenabar pulls the rug out from under you . based on 's own criteria , `` vanilla sky '' stinks . people watch movies to be entertained , to see a story , for two hours give or take . they do n't go to have nonsense hurled at them for two hours and then have that nonsense explained to them for the last fifteen minutes in a bunch of exposition by talking heads . there 's no rug to pull out because crowe forgets to even put one under you . the only possibility of enjoying this would be on a second viewing . that should never be the case . of course , next i 'll actually see the film `` sky '' is based on , which supposedly is all but a carbon copy of it , and i like it . no matter how similar the two films are , they are still two different films , made in different countries by different directors , with different actors -lrb- except cruz -rrb- . wanting to make an avant-garde , thinking piece is noble , but crowe , who had always been reliable , bricks this one . file `` vanilla sky '' under ` interesting , ' ` fascinating , ' ` ambitious , ' but not ` good . ' grade : c -		4		0
this was epically filmed , something which usually helps set the mood for me , but when the story drags at an unbelievably corpse-like pace , and even the stunning vistas fail to inspire , something 's wrong at the core of a work . the performances are ... okay , but was it really necessary to use 30 minutes ' of screen time to show the woman bouncing on the horse , trying to smile , in slow motion -lrb- notice i said `` trying to smile '' -rrb- ?! some may have been enchanted by this work , but frankly , i found it anything but . i was bored , and checking my watch less than halfway through this one , which is unusual for me . redford was good , but not riveting . he 's still a god , but this was the wrong vehicle , character , and director for him , which is sad , since he was the director . it was okay , but only mildly so . i ca n't say i was entertained . it rates a 3.6 / 10 from ... the fiend : .		4		0
the child 's play franchise goes for the trilogy !!! but on the 3rd one , it 's time for chucky to just give up and go to hell where he ultimately belongs !!! when i saw all 3 chucky films , i was young . this 3rd one , to a child of my age was ` cool ' . i look at it now , and i think - i did n't like this one did i ?!! andy has grown up , and it looks as though chucky is well and truly dead . 8 years have passed and andy has joined the army !! ... but , the company that make the good guy dolls re-make more dolls , using the same doll that chucky was in !! will they ever learn ??!! obviously not ! what follows this time is a tired storyline , only given a new lease of life due to chucky 's realisation that he does n't need andy , he can use another kid . to me , this one killed the franchise . it should have ended here !! without a doubt . but - they made a 4th , and there 's a 5th on the way !!!! anyway , to focus on the few good points of this movie - this , as with the 2nd film , features a gorgeous female character , so you 're interest is held only due to the fact that she 's in it !! a few good killing 's with more humour thrown in - i have to admit , when chucky jumps out brandishing a knife and lets out one of his trademark screams , and his victim suffers a heart attack , chucky 's response ? `` you 've got ta be f **** n kiddin me !!! '' that 's kinda funny !! all in all , a very poor film , and it looked as though the franchise would end here ... we were so wrong . there must be a loyal fanbase out there ... somewhere !!		4		0
some effort was made to do a good sci-fi movie , despite the disappointing result . a big part of the problem has to do with the fact that spielberg ca n't seem to make an honest to god sci-fi movie -lrb- i have n't been able to bring myself to see a.i. , so i 'll reserve judgement on that one , but i have my suspicions ... , and close encounters is n't my sci-fi cup of tea for sure -rrb- . the characters ca n't be motivated primarily by fear , nor do any of the issues of political infighting from dick 's story emerge strongly , but we do have a dead kid . that 's spielberg 's answer to everything : throw in dead kids . well , it 's been working for him for a long time -lrb- from `` jaws '' to `` shindler 's list '' -rrb- so i guess he 'll keep doing it until people stop pulling on their own heartstrings so hard . yes , that 's this movie 's excuse for a plot motivation -lrb- dick 's story had a political motive behind the murder in the majority report -rrb- . instead of being good science fiction , it just becomes another dumb shoot 'em up movie . it has great special effects , like all these 100 + million dollar movies do , but that 's getting to be kind of standard-issue these days . this movie needed a compelling story to make the effects and this vision of the future seem special , and it did n't have one : all it got was this dead kid . over and over again , tom cruise mourning and stalking around his apartment because of a dead kid . and of course it turned out that max von sydow was behind it -- anybody who 's seen any of these movies will expect that sydow or christopher lee or ernest borgnine or whoever it is will end up being the bad guy . no wonder when i saw it at a theatre in berkeley ca i saw -lrb- and heard -rrb- at least five of the fifty or so people in the audience sleeping . in the middle of the afternoon . yes , this film is siesta time . of course , it 's not all bad . but it 's got enough good stuff -lrb- good ideas from dick 's story , good actors like tim blake nelson and colin farrell and , come to mention it , tom cruise -rrb- to make the pretentious , obvious film that emerges seem even worse because of it . is it a coincidence that spielberg 's now working with tom cruise , the last male lead in stanley kubrick 's last film ? i was amazed to discover that after stanley kubrick died , spielberg was suddenly his best friend and wanted to make the movie he could have made with kubrick 7 years ago instead of `` jurassic park 2 '' . of course , i do n't really blame spielberg for not wanting to direct a movie under kubrick 's production -- nobody really knows what that would have been like . but now he 's making kubrick 's movies and working with the last actors he worked with . it 's like some kind of sick hero identification , or midlife crisis or something , and somebody who cares about spielberg should talk to him and tell him to make his own movies -- if he has any . it seems like his whole career he 's been in the shadow of others -lrb- jack arnold , and now kubrick -rrb- . also , i 'm getting a bit tired of all these movies going for the same look that bladerunner established in the 80s . this film is one of the poorer ones to try so far -- the only one i 've seen that does it with any success is the mid-90s `` dark city . '' i think sci-fi fans are getting a little sick of seeing this look over and over again -- i mean , enough with the cyberpunk hair cuts and fancy holographic photo equipment , if i wan na see it i 'll take out my dvd of bladerunner . i 'd rather just keep watching one good movie than a bunch of imitations .		4		0
a group of cave divers goes to explore a huge cave in romania . then just as they encounter some nasty creatures who live in the cave , there is a cavern collapse and they now have to find another way out . while surviving the highly predatory monsters . the concept of people being stranded in a dark , hostile environment with predatory creatures that see in the dark is plainly reminiscent of the far superior `` pitch black . '' some of the effects here even resemble that film and cole hauser is in both . the few `` startling revelations '' and a twist at the end are all things you 'll see clear as day well before they arrive . even the music is at times cliché , yet the film is n't wholly bad . the action scenes and special effects are ok . the direction , while also pretty straight forward and not really pulling any new punches , is decent and maybe if bruce hunt ever gets a decent horror script he 'll deliver a better movie . so , that makes this a run-of-the-mill creature flick . a run-of-the-mill creature flick that is shameless , unoriginal , and that means it will annoy fans of the movies that it rips off , to be a little more precise . 4/10 rated pg-13 for violence and some gore		4		0
my take : tedious alien invasion flick . this movie , in my opinion , is vastly overrated , but i do not give it out as a bad one , but it 's hardly one that 's impressive . why ? firstly , the movie revolves around the story of travis walton 's supposed alien abduction , but it hardly focuses on it . the movie shows us walton -lrb- d.b. sweeney -rrb- abducted by aliens , and then we 're left with the life of walton 's friends after the abduction , until he returns , and so does the alien invasion thing . it has too much plot to speak of , in one film . if the film wanted to impress us , or frighten us with a tale of alien abduction . it would have at least stuck with the plot . otherwise , the film just showed us a very quick , yet terrifying , look at the insides of a `` real '' alien spaceship , and the events that poor travis experienced in there . nevertheless , this film does deliver some great performances by the supporting cast , and it also keeps a rather eerie tone on some of the moments . but there are too few of these moments to justify it as a true alien-abduction thriller . really , in a movie about an unlucky civilian picked up by aliens , do we really want to know about what his buddies back on earth think about this ? rating : ** out of 5 .		4		0
many reviewers that liked bachelorette chastised others for trying to compare this to bridesmaids . well the reason that it is almost impossible not to compare the two is because bachelorette exists simply on bridesmaids coat tails . this film tries to simply cash in on everything that bridesmaids did -lrb- which was not much in my opinion . -rrb- everyone -lrb- usually women of course -rrb- raves about how hilarious bridesmaids was but i think it just happened to appeal to a demographic no one thought of before . women wanted a dirty raunchy comedy just for them and someone gave it to them . even if it was awful -lrb- which it was -rrb- they would say they loved it because it was a mass opinion . bachelorette was even worse . at least the bridesmaids girls had some chemistry and were relatively talented comediennes . the girls in this film are talented actresses but horrendous together . the worst part is this script that has these girls who are genuinely awful people . they are awful to each other , they are awful to themselves and just rotten human beings . it is a very mean spirited comedy and you struggle to find something to really laugh at . the romance in the movie is so minimal -lrb- at least bridesmaids had that aspect right . -rrb- now i 'm not saying mean spirited comedy ca n't be good and the performances in the film were actually good considering the characters were written to be awful . kirsten dunst gives a very good performance at being really awful . her character is simply an ultimate queen bitch . she is not likable even a little bit and never gets any sort of redemption or likability . so if the goal was to make you hate her character then dunst blows it away . lizzy caplan plays the free spirited and messed up gena . she might be the most likable in a completely bizarre and horribly messed up way . isla fisher was probably my favourite as the silly , less intelligent party girl . the downside to her character is the drug addiction , same with caplan . i ca n't find anything funny about a crack addiction nor the scene in which she overdoses which is used as a point of comedy ? not funny i assure you . and finally rebel wilson who is really the driving name to this film . she co-starred in bridesmaids and was a hit in pitch perfect . well , in this film she plays the non-funny one as the bride and the serious girl compared to the rest of them . she also attempts an american accent which she does okay at but it does fade in and out a lot . the guys in the film are familiar faces but at the same time do n't get any development to their character . james marsden who is a good actor gets nothing in this film and is almost as unlikable as dunst -lrb- fitting being they are paired together in an awkward and silly sex scene . -rrb- adam scott who is a talented comedian falls flat in this film . the romance between him and caplan was almost , almost , the best part of the film but written in such a way that it is ruined before it even begins . kyle bornheimer 's character as isla fisher 's love interest could have been fun too but as is the case with most of this film , everything is wasted . as is the case with most bad movies the person helming the picture is in charge of writing , directing , producing and in this case is responsible for the source material . they also usually have very little experience and writer , director , producer and playwright leslye headland fits the bill . she made something profoundly unfunny . it is strictly only saved by the fact that it does have some various talent like dunst , fisher and marsden whose charisma on screen overcomes how truly atrocious the script is . i ca n't even fathom this was a stage play because that would be even worse torture i would guess . i am okay with dark comedy , i can even handle mean-spirited comedy but a comedy should still be fun ... in some fashion . they sort of stumble around trying to be the hangover , trying to be bridesmaids , never find their own jive and basically letting any potential fall flat . i suppose some will grab onto this like they did bridesmaids but both are terrible ... only this one is worse . 4/10		4		0
as soon as the electronic title music starts you know you ` re going to be watching a deadly dull 80s film and this is a deadly dull 80s film . worse it ` s a deadly dull 80s film with a 70s screen icon ! . i ` m unable to emphasise just how much transporting dirty harry callahan to the 1980s fails to work . pony tailed punks , smack head heavy metal singers , designer suits and padded shoulders , video nasties , and health clubs do not belong in a dirty harry sequel . but by far the worst aspect to the dead pool is the extremely boring plot brought to us by a poor script which lacks any wit or quasi fascist subtext . if the producers were stuck for ideas - and i ` d be shocked if they were - maybe we could have had a story involving scorpio ` s twin brother taking revenge on harry callahan . an obvious plot idea perhaps but at least we ` d get another memorable performance from andrew robinson as a pyscho killer . and i can guarantee scorpio ` s brother would be a better shot than the bad guys in this film		4		0
this is premised on the notion that , if one dicaprio is good , two must be a whole lot better ... the costume drama has always been a good point of departure for movies . the best ones invest in a world . consider one of the champs of this genre , like `` barry lyndon '' ; in comparison , this is a day pass to . it 's a two-ton clunker and byrne is stuck with all the heavy lifting . malkovich and depardieu phone in their contributions . the real star is irons , who shines in everything he does . he does n't need this , so he stays above it all , and that alone is fun to watch . if you want a fab four with derring-do , stick with lester 's two `` musketeers '' features from '73 & ' 74 .		4		0
`` wrong turn '' was a great movie , the first one that is , then it started to go somewhat downhill in part 2 , and now having seen part 3 , i must say i am at a loss here . why is the series on a downward slope and not able to pull up ? the story in `` wrong turn 3 : left for dead '' is not really bad as such , but it is the lack of excitement and thrills that makes it less than mediocre . and also that there is basically only one of these misshapen mountain folk running around . sure , you see a boy as well and another towards the end , but throughout the entire movie it is just a single one doing all the killing . and he looks comical and goofy , so it is very hard to take him serious as a murdering mad man . there is an okay amount of mutilation , blood and gore in this third movie , and that is one of the better things about it . and another thing that made it bearable to sit through was that the people they had cast for the various roles were actually doing good jobs with their given characters . -lrb- just hard to take the mountain man serious as he looked like a spoof character ! -rrb- there is n't really any great plot twists or surprises to the movie , and it plows forward at a fairly good pace . the only surprise twist there was in the movie , was the end scene . i enjoyed it , and think it was actually a nice touch to the movie . but all throughout the movie i sat and hoped for the movie to pick up and shift into a higher gear . and there were some pretty funny errors and goofs in the movie . for starters , chavez must have incredible arm strength to be able to hold a shotgun out in stretched arm and fire it without any recoil . that was hilarious , even worse than rambo and his guns . the other thing i noticed was when they cut off the legs to remove the dead person from the chain , it must have been some amazingly sharp blade on that knife as it cut through meat and muscle like butter , and it cut through bone apparently without even slowing down - or perhaps that convict did n't have any shin bones ? it was just awful . i am sure that newcomers to the `` wrong turn '' series , will find it enjoyable , but if you are a seasoned and weathered gore hound , then you will find `` wrong turn 3 : left for dead '' to be nothing particularly interesting and to be a fairly mediocre movie at best . i have seen `` wrong turn 3 : left for dead '' twice now since it came out in 2009 , and ca n't say that it has gotten any better since . despite this , then i will still give parts 4 and 5 a go as well , just to have seen it all .		4		0
yeah fair enough , this is reckoned to be the worst disaster movie ever . agreed there ` s some really terrible acting involved with michael caine either ott or totally wooden from scene to scene with the kid playing paul giving a '' i ` m really terrified because i ` m waving my head from side to side and saying no , no , no an awful lot '' acting style . that said i do have a soft spot for the swarm because it is rather enjoyable due to the lapses in logic and science , and who can fail to be by the laughable dialogue like '' we ` ve been losing the war against the insects for 15 years but i ` d never thought it ` d be the bees - they ` ve always been our friends '' or '' has this nuclear power plant made any provisions against killer bees '' ? don ` t take it so seriously and you might just enjoy it		4		0
although i liked the film rec very much , i had distrust in the making of a sequel , because i did not feel the necessity to continue a story which had felt pretty complete on the first , the ambiguous ending from the original movie had been enough mysterious and satisfactory not to require any more guess that the only reason rec 2 was made was because of its economical , i have to admit i had very low expectations before watching rec 2 ... and unfortunately , the movie resulted to be worse than i expected . i hated rec 2 because i found it to be forced , weak and very boring.the characters shout a lot but say very little and the poor personalities from them are absolutely worst characters are a group of irritating young people , and their incorporation to the story only provokes even more intolerable shouts and hysteria . but the worst element from this crappy film is a horrible decision co-screenwriters jaume balagueró , paco plaza and manu diez -lrb- the first two ones were also the directors -rrb- made : the unexplainable addition of an element which had not been present on the original film , and which completely changes the perspective from the story.i will not reveal what that element is in order not to say spoilers , but i think that was a huge mistake which clashes with what had been established on the one hand , i understand that balagueró , plaza and diez did not want to repeat the same story ; but on the other hand , i can not believe that was the only way to do that . so , in summary , rec 2 is an awful horror film which does not get even 1 % of the quality and impact from the original movie.the suspense is inexistent , the screenplay is terribly boring and the characters are irritating , so i suggest you not to see rec 2 by any means .		4		0
earthquake 's biggest selling point , back in 1974 , was that theaters were advertising it as being released in sensurround , a process that had your theater seat shaking and trembling while buildings fell and bridges collapsed and los angeles went up in flames . unfortunately , it was a gimmick that dragged a lot of people into seeing this mess on the big theater screens to get their money 's worth out of . whether it was worth or not is doubtful , because the script of earthquake is so bad that all of the big name actors in it are seen at their most vulnerable . ava gardner is improbably cast as lorne greene 's daughter . she was fading fast in the looks department and her role was not worthy of her abilities to create a believable character . charlton heston is her hubby but he has eye on the much younger and still bubbly genevieve bujold . there are other sub-plots going on but none of them manage to create more than an idle interest until the buildings start to crumble under a crippling earthquake . when one character says , `` be careful crossing that bridge , '' you just know that 's a signal for the next special effect to take place . the special effects did win an oscar but look pretty shaky from the perspective of the passage of time . come to think of it , i 've seen even more spectacular effects in b & w films like the rains came back in the '30s . summing up : trivial plot is an excuse for l.a. to burn -- not worth waiting for .		4		0
dwayne johnson plays jack bruno , las vegas cabbie , and carla gugino is dr. alex friedman , ufo expert . perhaps you saw the preview in which bruno and friedman are crawling thru a tubular tunnel and she admits to a bit of claustrophobia . just then bruno reaches an opening into a deep vertical shaft and asks `` how are you with heights ? '' . it was a good scene , with a bit of low-key but contextually appropriate humor that the former rock has learned to deliver effectively , making him a big , strapping brute of a guy that you feel comfortable with . but that scene is n't in the film itself . instead , we see the aftermath , in which friedman is still a bit freaked out , for no apparent reason . the rest of the movie was like that , too . people seemed to be doing things with no credible motives . the 2 adults flee from no fewer than 4 sets of pursuers exhibiting varying degrees of hostility -lrb- the government , a cross between predator and inspector javert , bruno 's former mob boss mr. wolf and his , and the -rrb- . they do so to protect 2 teenage swedish , i mean space , aliens who are here to retrieve the mcguffin , um , recording device that will prevent their planet from launching a hostile takeover , uh , invasion . the gal of the pair , sara , is played by annasophia robb . we know from her performance in bridge to terabithia -lrb- 2007 , 9 * -rrb- that she can be a tremendously appealing young actress , but here she gets to do stuff like pointing her finger and saying `` go that way , jack bruno . '' . the boy , seth , is played by alexander ludwig , a cipher . the government 's head alien tracker warns bruno that the kids are not what they seem to be . anyone who 's ever seen a science-fiction movie -lrb- which apparently includes precisely zero of any characters who are actually in an sf movie -rrb- can only begin to imagine what might lurk beneath those placid blond exteriors , but this proves singularly for bruno , leading right up to the ending -lrb- disney , y ' know -rrb- , which was likewise not well set up by any of the preceding events . the scenes set at a ufo convention make good sport of stereotypes , which some people might find offensive but i choose to treat as endearing . and i loved the sly humor that they did leave in the script , wherein bruno asks the kids at the controls of the flying saucer `` do you know how to fly this thing ? '' , they respond `` how do you think we got here ? '' , and he replies `` well , you crashed ! '' . more of that , from another couple of passes thru the , would have earned this one an upgrade . -- -- -- -- -- * best sf & f film of the 21st century so far , imho		4		0
in 1913 , in carlton mine , , pennsylvania , the cruel owner of a mine uses poor children in the exploration and after an explosion , a group of children is buried alive . on the present days , karen tunny -lrb- lori heuring -rrb- has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease when the family savings have been spent in the treatment . without any money , she moves with her daughters sarah -lrb- scout taylor-compton -rrb- and emma -lrb- chloe moretz -rrb- to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband . karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home in the night , and sarah hears that there are zombies in the area . when emma becomes friend of mary , he mother believes she is an imaginary friend . however , when sarah 's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and emma vanishes , karen and sarah chase her nearby the mine . `` wicked little things '' is not a totally bad movie : the acting is good ; the make-up is creepy ; and the cinematography and the music score are excellent . however , the story , and consequently the screenplay , are very weak , indeed a bad collection of clichés . the beginning is reasonable , with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the patriarch . but when she arrives , coincidently the little zombies attack people without any consequences , for example , families do not search the missing persons . then the wicked mr. carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes , a typical clichés that he will die in the end . there is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing mr. carlton . when sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and can not run anymore , it is one the most stupid lines that i have ever seen in a horror movie . my vote is four . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` zombies ''		4		0
meet evan -lrb- ashton kutcher -rrb- a young disturbed man suffering from blackouts and memory loss from his troubled past . the only thing that can help him is his journal , which can make him travel back in time and save the love of his life kayleigh -lrb- amy smart -rrb- from becoming an unhappy suicidal crack whore . but of course , whenever evan travels back in time , he manages to screw up the future even more so this butterfly effect has really not much effect at all . now , maybe this movie would n't have been half as bad if the cast was different because the acting was just terrible . starting from logan lerman who portrays the younger version of evan and gives a painfully bad performance back to ashton kutcher who mumbles throughout the whole movie and his serious facial expressions were priceless . the only person who gave a great performance was amy smart . this movie had the whole audience roaring with laughter and half of them walking out . note to ashton : stick to comedy and do n't mess with the future . i would give the butterfly effect 4/10 .		4		0
there is a great , timely idea at the heart of albert brooks ' most recent comedy , but as it turns out , the idea is the most inspired aspect of this 2006 film . as a writer and director , he has been on a gradual artistic decline since his peak , 1985 's `` lost in america '' , when he effectively skewered the vacuity of materialistic yuppie values in a road-movie format . in this movie , he addresses an interesting topic , whether there is universality to comedy that transcends cultural differences at a time when hostilities have been peaking against americans in the middle east . the film starts out well with brooks , playing himself and struggling to find his next job in hollywood , is requested by the u.s. government to find out what makes muslims laugh in india and pakistan and submit a 500-page report about it . the problem is that the story loses much of its relevant punch by setting most of the action in delhi instead of a more area . while there is some humor in the scene where brooks interviews for an assistant and a running gag related to outsourcing , the film continues to deflate with his character 's persistent efforts to ask various indians what makes them laugh and prepares a stand-up concert to test his comic relevance to a local audience . this leads to an overlong performance scene that belabors the point that a comedian needs to develop a rapport with an audience before they will consider laughing . the story meanders quite a bit with tiresome stops at the pakistani border and the al-jazeera network offices , but brooks is so timid and self-absorbed in his approach that the film starts to induce yawns for its increasingly enervating tone . one intriguing angle is introduced involving suspicions about brooks from the indian and pakistani governments , but the pay-off is minimal . in fact , very little momentum is gained from a number of subplots , including one involving brooks ' perennially cheery assistant maya and her jealous iranian boyfriend . as maya , sheetal sheth provides one of the few bright spots in the film , but her character has little to do other than boost brooks ' morale . john carroll lynch has a few funny moments as a state department agent who turns out to be a longtime fan of the comedian . the movie does little to enhance the film-making reputation of brooks , who still shows a gift for self-deprecating humor , this time going all the way by playing a fictionalized version of himself . recalling his video shorts from the first incarnation of `` saturday night live '' back in the seventies , i keep thinking this could have been funnier and far more pertinent as a documentary with brooks actually doing the research with real muslims . given the poor box office reception to the movie , i am not too surprised that the dvd is very skimpy on extras - no commentary track from brooks or anything that has him explaining the genesis of the film , just four deleted scenes -lrb- including a silly gag with a new york cabbie in delhi -rrb- and the theatrical trailer .		4		0
gacy is set in the small chicago , illinois town of des plaines & starts during 1976 where local businessman john wayne gacy jr. -lrb- mark holton -rrb- lives with his wife kara -lrb- lutz -rrb- & their two young twin daughter 's . gacy is a well respected member of the des plaines community , he holds huge parties , employs various young men & likes to do volunteer work in the community like attending children 's parties dressed up as pogo the clown . however his respectable reputation seems at odds with the fact that he is a huge liar & brutal sadistic rapist & killer of young men ... co-written & directed by clive saunders this true-life biopic of notorious serial killer john wayne gacy is one of several indie produced films that profile some infamous serial killer or other from dahmer -lrb- 2002 -rrb- to the enjoyable ted bundy -lrb- 2002 -rrb- to the god awful the hillside strangler -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , i ca n't say gacy as a film did much for me & even at a short 80 odd minute run time i doubt i would ever want to watch it again . the film starts with a caption that explicitly states several character 's & events in the film have been fictionalised so gacy is maybe not as true to life as some may like , having said that whether it 's true to life or not it 's still not a very good film . it 's rather slow going for the most part & almost all of gacy 's crimes are omitted , at no point in gacy do we actually see gacy kill anyone which , considering it 's a film about a serial killer , could be thought of as a definite flaw . gacy is more of a drama than an exploitation flick , i thought the story & character 's were alright but a distinct lack of gruesome incident & the total omission of gacy 's crimes meant that gacy did n't really feel like a biopic of one of the most notorious serial killers ever . surely those crimes & evil acts were a huge part of him ? surely they are the only reason anyone even knows who he is ? how can the film almost totally ignore them ? the film looks alright , it 's reasonably well made although there 's a distinct lack of blood or gore , there 's plenty of maggots & cockroaches in gacy 's corpse strewn crawlspace but surely they would have totally overrun the entire house & not just stayed down in the crawlspace . apparently gacy is also known as ` the killer clown ' , in reality he was convicted & later executed -lrb- he was given 21 consecutive life sentences & 12 death sentences -rrb- for the rape & murder of 33 boys & young men -lrb- ranging between the ages of 14 & 21 -rrb- between 1972 & his arrest in 1978 -lrb- 27 of whom he actually buried in his crawlspace -rrb- . rumour has it gacy 's last words before his execution on may 10th in 1994 were ` kiss my ass ! ' . bizarrely after his execution gacy 's brain was removed & is now in the possession of dr. helen morrison although i have no idea what she intends to do with it or why she has it . although set in chicago the film was actually shot in california , it looks alright & has reasonable production values but it does n't have much of a 70 's feel or vibe to it . the acting is alright , adam baldwin has a small role at the start . gacy is a film about a serial killer that completely misses out all of the killings , as a drama it 's alright i suppose & at least it 's short but i doubt i would ever want to see it again & by all accounts it 's not that accurate .		4		0
my first reaction when this came to an end was that no matter its quality , it was tailor made for an oscar nomination . let 's be honest . the academy of motion picture arts and sciences is nothing if not a little bit self-serving , and much of the last half of this movie - once papa georges -lrb- ben kingsley -rrb- is revealed to be the early french film-maker georges melies -lrb- who is probably most famous for `` a trip to the moon , '' which he made in 1902 -rrb- - is essentially set aside as a celebration of the early days of movie-making . so , to me , that explains the oscar nomination for best picture , because to be perfectly honest i did n't think this movie was that great . in fact , i 'd sum up the first half , which revolves around young hugo cabret -lrb- asa butterfield -rrb- as confusing at best , with a direction and purpose that was mystifying - at least to me . hugo is an orphan who lives in the clock tower of a paris train station -lrb- unknown to the authorities . -rrb- he steals to survive , desperately tries to stay out of the reach of the authorities , who are represented by the station inspector -lrb- played by sacha baron cohen -rrb- and the only thing he has left from his father is an `` automaton '' - a sort of robot that does n't work anymore , but that hugo wants to fix , because he 's convinced that it bears a message from his father . together with isabelle -lrb- chloe grace moretz -rrb- - whose parents have also died and who lives with her godparents -lrb- the aforementioned papa georges and mama jeanne , played by helen mccrory -rrb- - he manages to fix the automaton , which proceeds to draw him a picture from `` a trip to the moon '' - the first movie he ever saw with his father . this finally leads them to the realization that papa georges is georges melies , and the story becomes an attempt to help georges overcome his own demons from the past . bluntly , i found this confusing and poorly paced . it has very much a fantasy feel about it at times , and i thought for a while -lrb- because i did n't know who the director was -rrb- that this may have been directed by tim burton - it has a very burton-esque style to it in places -lrb- particularly the depiction of the inner workings of the clock . -rrb- i was surprised at the closing credits to discover that the movie was actually directed by martin scorsese , but as i watched the credits , some of that style finally made sense to me . one of the co-producers of the movie is johnny depp - who is , of course , a frequent collaborator as an actor with tim burton . ok . the pieces began to fit together . give the movie credit for some effective special effects -lrb- in particular hugo 's two dream scenes revolving around the train and as he sees himself as an automaton -rrb- , and for a heartwarming ending , as melies is finally honoured for his film-making achievements . it was also nice to see -lrb- not enough , unfortunately -rrb- some clips from some of his movies . some of the memories melies shares also provide a tantalizing glimpse of early film-making techniques . yes , there are some good things to be found here . i still found it very difficult to get through the first hour , which was slow-paced and confusing to say the least . it picks up steam after that , and becomes more interesting , but it 's still hard to get past that first hour . -lrb- 4/10 -rrb-		4		0
of course , if you compare any sequel to its original it 's not going to compare favorably -lrb- in most cases -rrb- . of course , when you go against the grand-daddy of all monster movies -lrb- `` king kong '' , in this case -rrb- , what can you say about his `` son '' ? well , noting perhaps how scary and dark the original film was , `` son of kong '' goes for a lighter tone and comes up with some fun -lrb- if dated -rrb- humor . seems denham -lrb- armstrong -rrb- has to sneak out of new york to escape the barrage of lawsuits being thrown at him for the original damage the first kong had wrought . yet he hears about treasure that was hidden on kong island and so sets off with the same captain -lrb- reicher -rrb- and crew -lrb- most memorably the inimitable victor wong -rrb- that helped him in the original . of course , along the way , denham comes across another woman -lrb- mack , a less screechy version of fay wray -rrb- who helps him seek the fortune . but they also discover old king kong was a busy old kong and had the son to prove it . cute , fuzzy and inquisitive , he tags along and helps denham look for the treasure while fighting off looters , dinosaurs and other natural disasters . like i said , there is more humor this time out and that goes quite a way in making this a more enjoyable `` kong '' , if perhaps not the equal of the original -lrb- but we 've already been over that -rrb- . and it 's always good to see wong get in a good line or two , as he does here . and the fx are still as good as in the original -lrb- if a bit sparse -rrb- . but at 70 minutes , there 's just not enough story to make the characters worth revisiting . and no lines as memorable as `` t ` was beauty killed the beast '' . maybe that 's what they get for making the sequel in the same year as the original . oh well ... four stars for `` son of kong '' ; sorry kid , but your old man 's got ya beat .		4		0
the criticism of intent is a killer on bad films that have no real depth and do not last a few years beyond their intent 's purpose . such was to me watching spanish filmmaker luis buñuel 's vastly overrated black and white 1961 ` shock classic ' viridiana . of course , all the alleged shock value had to do with buñuel 's puerile attempts to poke fun at and scandalize both the roman catholic church and the regime of fascist dictator francisco franco , and nearly five decades later it looks more like a college prank video than any serious cinema . furthermore , it is not in the least bit subversive , as many poor critics claim , because its criticism of the church , especially - and even then , was so manifest as to make one wonder if those who claimed it had subversive qualities even knew what the term meant . of course , given buñuel 's start as a surrealist superstar - that overused and often misapplied term , it 's no surprise that much of his filmic career would be seen through such a pretentious lens - especially by fans as critics , rather than dealing with the individual films , and whether they fail or not . the fact is , while viridiana is a reasonably capably made film - on a technical level -lrb- although there is no standout cinematography , musical scoring , nor interesting visual compositions -rrb- , it fails because its screenplay is abysmal . as in other ` classics ' of his , whose luster has faded -lrb- think belle de jour -rrb- , viridiana is larded with cardboard characters , caricatures , and outright stereotypes that are bad enough , alone , but given that they are not put to any truly subversive use , makes them all the more a wasted effort . they also suggest the paper thin grasp of reality - especially the political sort , that die hard leftists like him are often represented as having ; making him the biggest unintended caricature of all those associated with the film . yes , buñuel is not as pretentious and lacking in filmic basics as that other surreal fraud , jean cocteau - so what ? that does n't make buñuel a master ; not even close , despite all the praise tossed his way . viridiana fails not for a huge error or two , but for an unending string of little wrong and inane things , such as ridiculous symbolism - viridiana sleepwalks and tosses ashes into jaime 's bed , and a film that moves far too quickly and gives no real insight into anything - especially its characters . for ellipses to work , they must be deployed within well-defined characterization , so that viewers can reasonably extrapolate the elided events . without that , the missing elements shortchange both the tale and the characters . furthermore , the film 's criticism of roman catholicism is absolutely depthless - it has been done before and since , and done better . there is no intellectual rigor , nor a hint of poesy . the political intent overwhelms the minuscule art . and , without real characters , who gives a damn what is intended ? the exercise is rendered pointless by its own incompetence , something that haunts most of the buñuel canon , which may explain why viridiana - film and character , have such vacancies in their gazes .		4		0
why , when she learned that someone had been arrested for the murder of her son 's seducer , did mrs hall tell her blackmailer that she had killed him ? did she suspect that her son , beau , had committed a murder ? if so , why did she never raise the issue with the boy ? he had already shocked her out of her wits by appearing in a gay sex video being penetrated anally -lrb- explicitly shown in the blackmailer 's video , in case we did n't get it -rrb- . would she not logically suspect him of being capable of hiding a murder as well ? instead , the film ends with a tearful hugging session between mother and -lrb- possible murderer -rrb- son . it was an utter moral mess , masquerading as some kind of message picture . the two directors -lrb- presumably of the same bent -rrb- were so keen to get their social message across that they were willing to the mother 's character in order to do so . it 's rather sad that fox searchlight and i5 were willing to finance this warped rubbish .		4		0
a lot of the original magic is absent in this belated sequel . the storyline is n't up to much and is never taken full advantage of . one thing that is sorely missed is the wide , power score from the first film . elmer bernstein was ditched and the music was done by long-time hack randy edelman used none of the themes from the original . it 's all just light-hearted cues that are used . the plot takes a backseat to long character explanation and development . the ghostbusters have been out of business since blowing up central park west . they are forbidden from performing public services . but a narrow-minded judge wants to send them to jail for causing a massive blackout . then , 2 ghosts show up and they bust them and before you can say ` who ya gon na call ? ' they are back busting undead ass . something i find very stupid and annoying about the plot is that the aforementioned judge and a city attorney repeatedly say that they do not believe in ghosts . obviously these guys have forgotten about the marshmallow man and the evil voice of gozer booming all over manhattan island . but the villain is n't as scary as the gozer . this time it 's vigo , a 14th century madman who wants to return to living form and has targeted weaver 's child as his host . he plans to do this before the stroke of midnight on new years eve 1989 or some baloney . for a film that has it 's build-up and climax on new year 's eve there is no mention xmas whatsoever . and the ending with the hidden painting is really corny . i scoop of trivia : in the montage with the ghostbusters running all over new york after suddenly coming back into business we see a clip of ray driving like a maniac and peter gives him a strange look . this scene was originally going to follow after the scene in which ray is hypnotised by the painting of vigo . the was supposed to crash into a tree in central park and we see a shot of the license plate fall off and ray come out of his trance . but this entire scene was cut from the film and is only left in the montage .		4		0
in `` season of the witch '' , nicolas cage and ron perlman play a couple of 14th century crusaders who were asked to lead a band of men to escort a girl accused of being a witch to an abbey where monks can exorcise her demons . however , is she really a witch or was she just randomly blamed for causing the pestilence in their country ? i do not know how nicolas cage chooses his projects , but he sure gets the cheesy ones like `` wicker man , '' `` sorcerer 's apprentice '' and , in the same general vein , this one . different times in history , but the same lame storytelling . the acting of everyone involved was so over the top , and yet , they were taking it all so seriously . the supposedly exciting scenes , like crossing the rickety old bridge , the attack of the wolves and even the grand face-off with the demons at the end , were plagued with unsatisfactory special effects . you know they were meant to be special because they sure took a lot of screen time . however , i found them unexciting and predictable . ok , this may be entertaining for a lazy afternoon , where you can simply turn off your brain and watch it to while away the time . but watching it in january where all the oscar bait films are being screened , it surely exposes how bad this film really is .		4		0
`` child 's play 3 '' is yet another tired horror sequel . produced immediately after the release of its immediate predecessor , it is well made on a technical level , but the material is wearing thin . the story gets off to a good start ; many years after the previous films , the toy company plans to put the `` chucky '' doll back into production , deciding that all the negative publicity surrounding the `` unexplained '' deaths has passed . chucky himself is resurrected in a new -lrb- but identical -rrb- body , and after dispatching the company president , tracks down little andy , who is now a troubled teen in a military school . so far so good , but the writers have little idea where to go after setting up the story , which descends into the usual tedious business . even the novelty of the setting does n't really help . the opening credits are stylish , but we need a little more than that for plot . justin whalin is admittedly credible in the role of the grown andy , and offers what is probably a reasonably accurate portrait of how the character would have changed in eight to ten years . the filmmakers could have made a worse movie by giving us an stereotypical annoying teen character in the lead , but they managed to avoid that problem at least . travis fine 's character is , however , the most hateful in the entire movie . i realize there 's a jerk in every military setting , but this is one guy who deserves to be killed off early on , so that we may be spared his immature antics . brad dourif lends his squeaky voice to the killer doll once more , though i wonder if he was getting tired of the routine by this point . andrew robinson is wasted as a mean-spirited barber . after an interminable period of uninspired kills , the film climaxes at an nearby amusement park . this portion of the film is incredibly contrived . first of all , i doubt that such a place would be located anywhere a military establishment . even if i am wrong on this , the whole thing still feels tacked on . there is no creative reason why such a setting is necessary . it is painfully clear that the writers were fumbling for ideas and simply picked something at random . perhaps someone involved in the production was a fan of tobe hooper 's `` funhouse . '' at the very least , `` child 's play 3 '' does not hint at the possibility of a sequel ; though one was eventually produced years later , that is another review altogether . * 1/2 -lrb- out of **** -rrb- released by universal pictures		4		0
the amazing transparent man begins with a jail break . a safe-cracker named joey faust -lrb- douglas kennedy -rrb- escapes the prison he was in and runs into the nearby woods as the prison guards chase him . joey gets into laura matson 's -lrb- marguerite chapman -rrb- car and they both speed off . laura works for major paul krenner -lrb- james griffith -rrb- and was waiting to pick joey up on pauls instructions . laura takes paul to an isolated house in the middle of nowhere . once there joey is introduced to paul and his rifle wielding henchman , julian -lrb- boyd ` red ' morgan -rrb- . paul explains to joey why he helped him break out of prison . it seems that upstairs in a laboratory paul has forced a scientist named peter ulof -lrb- ivan triesault -rrb- , by threatening the life of his daughter maria -lrb- carmel daniel -rrb- , to develop some sort of x-ray machine that neutralises all tissue and bone structure in the body and turns whoever is subjected to it 's rays completely invisible . paul explains that dr. ulof needs more radium to further his experiments and that he want 's joey to undergo the invisibility process and steal the radium from a heavily armed vault . or be killed . joey agrees and does as paul asks . however , joey becomes unhappy with pauls measly $ 1,000 a job and decides to rob a bank for himself , hey would n't you ? it also becomes clear that paul is a total loony who want 's to create an army of invisible soldiers to take over the united states ! and he likes to slap laura around a bit which joey does n't like either . things go further awry when joey discovers a side-effect to the invisibility treatment he had n't counted on . will joey put his selfish ambitions aside and put an end to pauls insane plan ? watch it and find out ! directed by edgar d. i thought this was an ok time waster , which was at least short as it lasts for under an hour . the script by jack lewis is ok but not much is done with the story which had more potential than what ended up on screen . it keeps moving at a fair pace and does n't really become boring . having said that the film as a whole just is n't very exciting or interesting , it has few characters and peoples motivations and actions are questionable to say the least . there 's no violence and the ` invisibility ' effects are ok considering the year this was made in . the acting is n't great and i disliked douglas kennedy in the lead role , i just thought he was too old and overweight for the part of a top safe-cracker . he did n't feel right somehow . the black and white photography by meredith m. nicholson is perfectly adequate and is fairly crisp and clear . not a bad way to spend an hour if you 've got nothing better to do but do n't expect too much from it , average at best .		4		0
dracula 2000 is a horror film that was continually shown on sky movies in britain and considering it seemed to be screened about three times a week for a whole year i have absolutely no idea how i managed to miss it until it ` s first broadcast on network television tonight . actually seeing as i ` m not much of a fan of horror movies the reason was probably down to my theory that this was going to be tripe . my theory was proved right for the most part !!!!! minor spoilers !!!!! what makes dracula 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of dumb scripting involved . for example early in the film the bad guys are flying dracula ` s coffin from london to america -lrb- in a twin engine turbo prop plane ! -rrb- and one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo hold where dracula comes to life . a fight breaks out , there ` s lots of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit don ` t hear a sound until the script demands it . it also appears in this segment ` s climax that dracula can control the weather but this seems forgotten about as the film progresses . sloppy scripting , and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there ` s numerous scenes of characters being at the new orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they ` re back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of in the plot is enhanced there ` s something else that yanked my chain - product placement . there ` s umpteen scenes where the logo for a certain record chain is in full view . i won ` t dare publicise the company brand -lrb- except to say they also run a train company which is a national joke in britain -rrb- but i was under the impression this type of advertising was against british broadcasting and i ` m surprised the bbc showed this movie if that ` s the case there are some positives in dracula 2000 like the visuals for example . this is actually a good looking movie with a good looking cast and boy were those vampire chicks hot , but it ` s something we should expect from hollywood over the last few years - a very good looking movie that ` s very dumb		4		0

laurie strode -lrb- jamie lee curtis -rrb- is now in an asylum , where she awaits the inevitable return of michael myers . myers , after visiting her , returns to his childhood home and makes a nightmare for a group of kids who have decided to film a reality show inside the house . first of all , this film pretends that halloween 4 through 6 never happened , creating the possibility that the myers house has been abandoned for decades , rather than lived in by other families . this reboot is a result of the writing on h20 , but it was still a bad idea no matter who started it . second , one would think that bringing in rick rosenthal would be a good idea . he made `` halloween 2 '' , which was probably the last solid part of the franchise . but rosenthal is clearly not the horror directing master we might have thought , as he approaches this film with a weak vision and sense of style , more emulating mtv than his own work . a quick glance at his credits will explain this : he has spent the last twenty years making television rather than horror films . next , add busta rhymes . like its previous installment with ll cool j , this is the point in the series where a rapper is added to the mix . much like how many horror franchises ultimately ended up in space , many started adding rappers to the cast . why ? i do not know . but it does nothing to help the credibility of the picture . busta rhymes and tyra banks do not have the appeal for horror fans that other actors would have . the pov camera thing is a mess . it looks bad and is more or less a bad idea . yes , it has worked in such films as `` the blair witch project '' and more recent excursions . it does not work here . had they cut that aspect out entirely , this film would have been a bit better instantly . no horror franchise took as big of a nosedive as `` halloween '' , with this being the final crash landing . reviews of this film were so poor , and viewer appreciation so weak , it 's very unlikely they will ever make another one in the series . yes , they made the two rob zombie films after this , but i just like to pretend that never happened .		4		0
maybe i have a soft spot somewhere in my heart for poorly written , badly conceived , silly 1960s children 's movies - but i really ca n't understand why santa claus versus the martians is in the worst 100 movies of all time here on imdb . sure , most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief when it ends , but this film really seems downright harmless compared to the six month old kennel ration hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film for the last ten or so years . hey , at least it 's not a remake , a sequel , or a 2 hour long cgi cartoon with a few human faces tossed in for effect . santa claus gets kidnapped by distraught martians -lrb- white guys with bad green makeup and a few dishwasher parts glued to their heads , as well as inexplicable capes -rrb- , who want to rescue their depressive , antisocial children from the doldrums by giving them all toys and a big guy with a beard to laugh at ... err ... with . santa adapts to life on mars very well and starts cranking out the toys with the help of martian machines , but political controversies surrounding his activities soon threaten the fabric of martian society . i 'm not kidding ... really ... this is the plot . aside from the ludicrous plot and mediocre acting -lrb- bill mccutcheon gives the only really enjoyable performance in this film , though pia zadora and vincent beck are not too bad -rrb- , this is no worse than many of the kid films of its time . in the age of add and general impatience , however , this film is more than a little dated . the only modern kid i can imagine enjoying this film is one with an extraordinarily great attention span and a penchant for b-films . in terms of production , this film has the feel of a 2 hour , 1960s low budget tv show , and is almost as clever . i would recommend avoiding this film unless you 're compelled to watch films which go to extremes . i found it cute , funny , and more than a tad ridiculous . to most people , it 's a film version of your great aunt 's wallpaper - it 's just there on the tv , while far more interesting things are happening in the carpet below your feet .		4		0
i know i 'm going to get slammed for this , but sorry : the script was horrid , even worse than `` gladiator , '' which also nabbed an oscar nod . come on : a legendary sword is stolen by a spoiled brat , and retrieved by its guardians , who try to put said brat on the path of righteousness . that 's it ! the fact the brat is a girl is what 's supposed to make us all go `` whoa ! '' and , as if the writers knew how trite that was , they decided to torture us with an incredibly long flashback sequence that 's even more boring than the main story ! that critics overlooked the weak story line and god-awful pokemon dialog strikes me as patronizing and more than a bit racist . were this made by americans , it would 've been slammed big time ! and it sure as heck would n't have bagged 4 oscars ! it was obvious the actors were on wires . yeoh 's run across the roof reminded me of the race between clark kent and the train in `` superman '' -- it was that stiff . why did n't lee correct this , because everything depends on us being totally sold on the characters ' ability to fly ? with the exception of the fight in the restaurant , the fights get tiresome . the `` love story ? '' as the saying goes , crap or get off the pot ! were it a 30 minute short , cthd would 've been killer : the costumes and cinematography are to die for ! but as a 2 hour film , it 's an exercise in tedium !		4		0
this was like a christmas movie on drugs ! there are aliens , robots , cheesy special effects , and santa claus . there are quite a few laughs at the silly dialog and fake battle sequences . in the end , this is a pretty good movie . when all the children of mars become sad that they do n't have anyone to spread holiday cheer , kimar and his group travel to earth to kidnap santa . along the way , they also kidnap two children named betty & bill . when they get to mars , everybody loves that santa is there , except voldar who tries to get rid of him before christmas , because he thinks santa is corrupting the minds of the children of mars . will santa , betty , bill , kimar , and the children of mars be able to stop voldar ? i 'd definitely recommend santa claus conquers the martians !!!		4		0
i never had the guts to watch bride of chucky . the second child 's play was hard enough on the nerves . however i found seed of chucky tolerable , and if i dare say so , there was a visual art to the movie non-existent in today 's more mainstream shows . i ca n't explain it , and to be fair , do n't watch this movie because of the art direction please . this movie involves chucky and tiffany 's kid who finds his parents in hollywood . the disturbing twist is the child has a problem that only ed wood would understand : is he glen or glenda ? this leads to some disturbing moments , particularly toward the end . to round it up , the movie sucks , and the horror , if there was any in the series to begin with , is nowhere to be found . i swear the movie almost feels like a television episode but that is a redeeming quality , believe me . some cameos here and there , but only after some homework did i find them . s club 7 hannah is also in there but throughout the movie i was wondering which spice girl was i seeing on screen . to billy joel , the good die young but in seed of chucky they have n't a prayer 's chance getting any remorse .		4		0
as the sleazy owner shows dahlia -lrb- jennifer connelly -rrb- and her daughter ceci -lrb- ariel gade -rrb- around a run down apartment , he makes a big deal out of the fact that the shower door is made from toughened glass . no prizes for guessing that someone gets trapped in the shower later on . such is the low level of inventiveness on show in dark water , a us remake of hideo nakata 's japanese ghost movie . dahlia is in the process of divorce , has little money and so reluctantly takes the apartment . then all manner of weird happenings occur -- water constantly drips from the ceiling , footsteps are heard in the empty room above , and ceci starts talking to an ` imaginary friend ' natasha . could natasha possibly be the ghost of the missing child from the room above ? will dahlia find the body ? will the body be somewhere watery ? yep , yep and yep again . ho hum . walter salles 's remake is slow , dreary and very predictable and viewers expecting either a spooky or scary film should be warned -- dark water is neither . despite good performances from leads connelly and gade , this film can not escape the fact that we 've seen this kind of thing many times before , and in far superior films . the ending , an attempt at bringing some life into this dismal film , only ends up confusing the viewer , as natasha suddenly turns nasty and tries to off ceci in order to take her place . the manner in which dahlia saves her daughter is a complete let down -lrb- and thus , i suppose , is in keeping with the rest of the film -rrb- . i have n't seen the original dark water yet , but it is in my ` to view ' pile of dvds ; it will be interesting to see how it compares ...		4		0
legendary outlaw of the old west jesse james , on the run from marshal , hides out in the castle of baron frankenstein 's granddaughter maria , who proceeds to transform jesse 's slow-witted pal hank into a bald zombie , which she names igor . this film is generally considered to be pretty awful and has a fairly low rating on imdb -lrb- though i have seen worse ratings -rrb- . i am not going to dispute this by saying it is a forgotten masterpiece , but really ... it may not be as terrible as you might want to believe . the acting is pretty bad and the plot is a bit questionable , but there is something to be said about campy movies . they have their place . and , really , how many horror westerns are there ? not as many as there probably could be . this is a bit of ground breaker .		4		0
the nap time story . this is a heart felt tv movie of the week version of the birth of jesus . unfortunately its so bland that its sure to put most people to sleep . this is n't to say its bad , it 's not but it is unengaging and paced in such away that the odds are you 'll start to nod off before the film ends . in fairness i have to say that the film looks great and the performances are good . had they managed to get a script that actually had some drama then this might have been a watchable movie instead of a sleeping potion . as it stands now its a good looking film who 's real notoriety is based not on the quality of the film rather that the teenage actress playing mary ended up pregnant on the set . worth a look for those in need of sleep .		4		0
a time . and its crumbs . nothing more . game of testify and irony , pieces of lost memories and joy to describe , not very bad , communism . the details are not important . the exaggeration is only for taste . it is not a documentary . but an exercise to say truth in soft way . so , it is nice and amusing . a form to imagine a death world who lives in every slide of romanian reality . a story about people in the skin of totalitarian regime . a masterpiece if compare it with lui nicolae . with small ambitions and great sense of ridiculous . with desire to amusing and rediscover years when to survive was the first preoccupation . and title of one talented sugar daddy director . that is all . !		4		0
carnosaur is a terrible movie . just terrible . adam simon wrote the screenplay , from john brosnan 's treatment developed from his own novel -lrb- the mind boggles at just how barmy the novel must be -rrb- , and also directed , with a little helping hand from darren moloney . the plot is ... ... ... completely bonkers . a brilliant , though clearly , geneticist -lrb- played by diane ladd -rrb- decides that the world should have dinosaurs back in their rightful place at the top of the food chain so she starts trying to bring them back by manipulating chicken eggs . as you do . the main people who end up trying to stop her are a night watchman -lrb- raphael sbarge -rrb- and an eco-warrior type -lrb- jennifer runyon -rrb- . the pacing is okay , the script is laughable , the involved is even more laughable and the acting is , surprisingly , actually okay considering the material . clint howard has a small role and the main creature shots involve a puppet being shot up close chasing people who have to pretend to be terrified . going by normal standards this movie is absolutely appalling but it 's so bad that it 's laughably entertaining . how this spawned two sequels is a mystery to me but , as you may have already guessed , i 'm already curious to see how much worse things can get .		4		0
i was actually fascinated with the visual effect created by 300 . portraying spartans as fearless , free , supermen , frank miller has one large imagination that so far has suited the green , uh , silver screen very well . of course , plenty of blood and gore litter this over-stylized battle of thermopylae , but miller 's imagination is not without some fantastic views on xerxes , his immortals , the traitor ephialtes , the ephors and the oracle among others . a messenger convoy from persia to sparta brings word that their king xerxes comes for earth and water . the king does n't buy it , or any doomsday prophecies for that matter , and enlists the best 300 soldiers to meet up with other greeks to confront with xerxes at the `` hot gates . '' 300 could appeal to any inner comic book fan . comic books have always had a faithful following in movies and 300 is an easy example as to why the genre will continue to remain strong . making history look sharp and cool , no matter how silly the script , props or choreography , will sell . the impressive post-production made an entire film set on a green screen backdrop into a rugged , dark and gory terrain . that in itself deserves notice .		4		0
tarantino is at it again ! now , i never really saw any of this guy 's movies with the exception of parts of `` kill bill vol . 1 '' , where i instantly see his style of filmmaking , long running times and gallons of blood . then this jolly little film comes out an i expected it to be a typical western film , kinda like the lone ranger , jonah hex , or even zorro . what i actually saw was not what i expected . what we have here is a standard revenge story . django was sold as a slave and separated from his lovely wife broomhilda only to be liberated by a lovable german bounty hunter named doctor schultz . schultz , unlike most folks at the time , pretty much dislikes slavery , so naturally he frees django in return for being partners in justice as they set out to gain enough bounty to launch a rescue mission to save broomhilda from the tyrannical white man . this story could have been done a lot better in a shorter screen time , but tarantino misses the mark here . first of all , so many dialog scenes dragged on for eternity . the viewer will get the point after the first few minutes of the conversations , even though there are some subtle moments here and there . second , there was a point where the film forgets it 's an action film and the level of violence that is present is greatly exaggerated , people exploding like watermelons thrown into the jaws of alligators -lrb- which is to be expected from tarantino -rrb- . i found myself bored and finding many moments to be a little silly . i will give the film credit based on two performances . jamie foxx did fine in my opinion , but the ones who stand out are christoph waltz and samuel l. jackson . christoph waltz as doctor schultz was a great character , full of charm and is a very sly dog when it comes to action or words . best character in the film , though the end result near the end of the film left me disappointed . samuel jackson is pretty funny sometimes , often to the point where i was laughing pretty hard . aside from the mentioned performances , i do n't see why people are praising this movie . it 's really stupid , slower than a turtle with iron weights on its back , and a major letdown . not to mention , it kept using the `` n-word '' so much ; i have never heard such a continuous use of that word in my entire life and it really gets old very fast . i suggest you do n't waste time with this film because it is so not worth it .		4		0
tim burton used his star power to assemble one of the highest power casts you 'll see in a mid 90 's film . unfortunately , he does n't give them that much to do . `` mars attacks '' much like `` the informant ! '' plays like a joke that does n't provoke laughter as much as it does a sense of knowing where burton was going with the film . basically , he tries to lampoon the 1950 's creature feature film particularly `` the day the earth stood still '' but an underlying and tendency toward strong violence sucks much of the fun out of the film . the writers provide only a modest amount of fun from which to take leaving burton to rely on cgi speedos on the martians and the - including tom jones wasted by simply playing himself - to push the movie along . burton cross the spoof line in a few spots and instead simply lifts ideas from much better films particularly rod steiger 's general decker a copy of george c scott general turgidson from `` dr. stangelove . '' the plagiarism serves not as homage but as a sign that you could be watching a much better film . in short , better parody of the same material exists elsewhere .		4		0
with each film , director gaspar noe aims to provoke , disorient , and even violate the viewer in some way ; as a result , one gets the impression that he invites the vitriol of those who would slam his cinematic vision . now , while i was compelled -lrb- if not `` entertained '' -rrb- by the subjectivity of noe 's `` i stand alone '' -lrb- the tale of a sociopath butcher wandering around france with a whole lot of pent-up anger -rrb- and `` irreversible '' -lrb- a tale of revenge and rape -rrb- , `` enter the void '' is an agonizingly overlong tale of death and the afterlife that mistakes , drug-trip informed imagery as a profound comment on a world beyond our own mortality . in its first half , `` void '' manages to compel and intrigue , even if our grating and unsympathetic protagonists -lrb- a brother-and-sister duo living in japan as a drug dealer and a stripper , respectively -rrb- do very little to make all the flashy neon seem like more than aesthetic window-dressing . at 90 minutes , `` void '' is a passable -lrb- if largely empty -rrb- film , but as it crawls towards the 3-hour mark , it becomes obnoxious , intolerable , and infuriating -lrb- with noe 's pretentious excesses -- culminating in a literal orgy -- becoming the stuff of yawns rather than gasps -rrb- .		4		0
this movie could have been a very interesting drama about las vegas gangsters , but martin scorsese ruins it with the film-making technique he used in `` goodfellas '' : expository narration . it was annoying in `` goodfellas , '' but is very heavily used here . instead of letting the action guide the plot , he has characters give background narration for every single point of action in the damned film . you 're told rather than shown what happened . if i wanted to be told something , i 'd read a book . movies a re more interesting when character dialogue and action move the plot . narration slows the movie down to a grinding halt . oh , and there 's `` casino 's '' claim to fame : the most uses of the `` f '' word in an english-language non-documentary film . every other word is `` f '' this and `` f '' that . i know gangsters are tough , macho men who love to speak dirty , but this is way too much . again , this is where action may have helped to convey the characterization of tough gangsters , rather than the `` f '' word every second . this film needed better dialogue . `` the godfather '' has excellent dialogue , and though there are dirty words , it 's balanced out by intelligent writing . `` casino '' does n't have going for it in terms of good writing , unless it 's to show that the vegas mob was run by a bunch of unintelligent morons who ca n't form a complete sentence without the `` f '' word . the acting is extreme and over-the-top . sharon stone is less than spectacular as a drug-addled , high-strung moll . she 's either laughing or screaming , and nothing more . she chews the scenery like a starving pit bull . de niro does little but blend into the background . joe pesci seems like his snl caricature , screaming and squeezing heads into vices . granted , i 'm interested in the history of the las vegas mob , and this movie is based on a nonfiction book ; but the writing was bad , and the narration device distracted from my enjoyment of the action . i did n't like `` goodfellas , '' but it was leaps and bounds superior to this dreck . i do not recommend this , except maybe for a rental . watch the dvd extras that feature an a & e documentary on the real las vegas mafia .		4		0
i like most of the movies that russell crowe has made and i dislike about every movie meg ryan has been it ... so who prevails ? well , in here ryan prevails again , with yet another unattractive role and movie . ryan 's `` alice bowman '' was too profane and unlikable ; her sister , `` janis '' -lrb- pamela reed -rrb- was just plain annoying and so were most of the characters in here including the kidnap victim played by david morse . did crowe play a decent character , as he usually does ? yes . i like david caruso , too , but overall this film had bad vibes and too few people to care about . kudos to the cinematographer , however . this is a beautifully shot movie . with a little nicer characters and less usage of the lord 's name in vain and i might have liked this film because the story is very intriguing . maybe another viewing some time in the future will change my mind about this . i also had high expectations off reviews i had read , so i expected a lot more than what i got .		4		0
i was mostly disappointed with this film.it takes too long to get going , in my opinion.it is n't really very funny , either , so i would n't use the word comedy to describe it , it never really felt like an actual movie.it felt disjointed , like bits and pieces of more than one movie.some of the action sequences were pretty good though , including a couple of car chases and and a couple of fight i think the word overkill can be used to describe all the explosions and , seth rogen was annoying , not good since he was playing the title chou was okay as kato , his sidekick , but cameron diaz had a thankless role as britt reid 's , a disappointment , with a few good moments here and me , the green hornet -lrb- 2011 -rrb- is a 4/10		4		0
i will keep this review short , sharp and to the point . the sixth harry potter book is by far my favourite , with a nice balance of story , character building and action . this movie , however , is probably the one of the worst of the movies . despite the entire cast giving great performances and the usual excellent special effects and score , the story was appalling , with so many vital points omitted and needlessly changed . so , to put this simply : fans of the book will come out sorely disappointed and fans of the movies will come out happy , but slightly confused . the pacing is all over the shop , most of the movie just jumps from scene to scene until the last half hour in which everything slows down for awhile . i feel i need to list some of the things which were cut , and were sorely needed for a more complete harry potter experience . without these , this film just piles on copious amounts of information and expects the audience , fan or not , to be able to understand . so , to begin : - rufus scrimgeour 's character is gone , meaning the entire first chapter is gone . - the 's are absent as well , meaning one of the funniest chapters is also gone . - the gaunts are also cut , meaning one of the most vital memories is , you guessed it , not there . - the battle at hogwarts at the end ... is gone ... completely . this confuses me , as this was an amazing chapter . - also , the final chapter has been cut , which is just stupid in my opinion . - there is much more , but i do n't want the list to go on forever ... now , david yates has given excuses for leaving this stuff out , but they are poor and just weak . with book as complicated and rich as the half blood prince you have to film almost every scene to get a full picture . this movie is adequate in terms of `` blockbuster entertainment '' but fails to do justice to its source . despite it being mostly entertaining and quite funny , i can only give it ... 2/5		4		0
this film takes a very serious book and tries to make it into a movie but in doing so seems to lose the focus of the issues it presents . that is because it goes into several issues . the main focus is the abuse of animals and workers in making burgers for consumption at america 's fast food restaurants . the burgers are supposed to be contaminated with animal droppings to put it nicely . the film looks at the illegal alien problem in america in that it shows meat plant workers being folks who come across the border . it goes into some sexual & drug problems with a supervisor having his way with many of the women at his plant . late in the movie it shows the killing room . the film presents an inept group of teens who nearly get themselves hurt trying to help the cows . because of the number of issues presented , the film tends to lose focus and not present any of them effectively enough . the pace of the movie is something akin to watching an entire professional golf tournament . if your into the activity , you will stick it out . if your not , you will lose your focus too . after seeing this , i get the feeling the book which i have not read , might be a stronger plot . this is like melba toast .		4		0
fear -lrb- 1996 -rrb- ** starring : reese witherspoon , mark wahlberg , william l. petersen , amy brenneman , alyssa milano director : james foley 97 minutes rated r -lrb- for violence , sexuality , language and drug use -rrb- by blake french : `` fear '' is a desperate , thriller . it does manage to generate some heavy suspense in the twenty minute finale , but that does not make the film worth seeing . it wastes the talents of the lovely reese witherspoon , william l. petersen , and i suppose mark wahlberg too . i hesitate to state that wahlberg 's talents put to waste because i am not sure that , beyond an attractive body , he has any . and james foley -- what in the world , he is something else . after watching `` the corrupter '' earlier this year , and now this piece of trash , not to mention his past flops , `` the chamber , '' -lrb- 1996 -rrb- and `` two bits , '' -lrb- 1995 -rrb- , i begin to wonder about his career in the future . `` fear '' takes a spin on the old `` girlfriend and boyfriend -- boyfriend is not whom he seems '' genre . the sub-title to this film is `` together forever ... or else , '' but most of the movie does n't live up to that clever plot point . the teenage girl in the picture , nicole walker , is well played by reese witherspoon , but if i was in charge i 'd have to say that alicia silverstone was born for the role . although i hold nothing against witherspoon . in fact , i think she should get recognition for her performance this year in `` election . '' i just think silverstone has the punky , street girl type attitude more than witherspoon . anyway , the teenage girl in the picture , nicole walker , is like all other teens her age , about sixteen . she has a father , steve , who does n't want his little girl to grow up , a mother who takes her side , and friends , billy and margo masse who may or may not betray her before the film is over . she has a hard time getting a date usually , but when going out with her friends one night , seeing a muscular , seductive hunk playing pool named david , the next time they meet it is almost love at first sight . when he is introduced to nicole 's parents , who naturally live in a house guarded with high tech security systems and camera surveillance , along with a police officer watching over the dorm , the vibes are at first too good to be true , then become quite bleak . after a few instances involving david and nicole 's friend billy , steve begins to suspect something more to david than meets the eye . and guess what ? he 's right . first he discovers that david has no family or apparent history , and then finds out his spent his childhood being shipped from orphanage to orphanage . after the emotional and physical battles begin steve and david , and nicole changes her mind about this hunk who she was quick to judge . david 's obsession with nicole leads to some extenuating -- and even murderous -- circumstances . there is some character chemistry between the david and nicole characters , and the way their relationship is presented , their circumstances are surprisingly believable . the problem with the characters : instead of witnessing the development of the character 's relationship , we get scene after scene of david and nicole sensuously making out and starring into each others eyes , never actually letting us become involved . and the scenes , which are supposed to be steamy and hot , are strained and fake looking . the film is so desperate for tension , which is not supplied by the script , it even features a scene where walhberg 1 -rrb- pounds his chest so hard it gives him bruises in order to frame nicole 's father , 2 -rrb- creates a homemade tattoo on his chest that reads `` nicole 4 ever , '' and 3 -rrb- concludes with an ending without any motive that precedes in the script . none of these things have any dramatic purpose in the film . the scenes where david deforms his body only prove to us that he has an uncontrollable love for a girl that not hates him , but also we never feel anything in his young mind simply because of the lack of character development . so to make a long paragraph short , the film is all build up and hardly no payoff . the filmmakers clearly desire to go for outright suspense and skip the terror . and under the circumstances , they do a pretty good job . the ending is kind of interesting , and mark walhberg does provide an evil eye to die for , too bad he ca n't get over his flamboyant self esteem -- both in and out of character . there is even a disappointing false first act that tries to make us believe nicole and david are over with . give me a break . for once , why ca n't the girl be the psycho . now that would be an original and engaging thriller .		4		0
`` la cage aux rossignols '' , released in 1945 , was one of the last movies of the occupation days . `` les choristes '' , although they have transposed the action to the fifties , hints at it when a young brat breaks into `` , nous voilà ! '' , anthem of those dark years.the question is : was it necessary to the songs are splendid and are likely to become part of the repertoire of all the french schools . yes the boy who plays mesmerizes the audience , and like brigitte fossey -lrb- `` jeux interdits '' -rrb- or benoit magimel -lrb- `` la vie est un long '' -rrb- he may become an actor when he grows up . the original screenplay has undergone some changes : it has become a long flashback , with an ending which focuses one more time on success and fame , borrowing more from `` professor holland 's opus '' than from dreville 's old flick.the rebel pupil 's sister has become an unmarried mother , which was unthinkable in the jacques perrin - who has seen better days , artistically speaking - appears as the umpteenth version of the ugly duckling turned into a swan . and finally the jugnot vehicle has the same drawbacks as its model : the kids become quickly much too quickly a heavenly choir , do know that , in both movies , the young actors are in real life.the characters remain cardboard and gérard jugnot is neither better nor worse than . what 's amazing is that generally `` la cage aux rossignols '' is dismissed as cheesy and maudlin -lrb- its rating is average -rrb- whereas its remake is praised to the 's the same old song though .		4		0
when i saw clips of this film i knew it could be terrible , it was originally rated one star , but critics changed this to two , so i wondered if it was worth it , from director brian robbins -lrb- norbit -rrb- . basically in new york , an alien ship that looks like a regular human -lrb- eddie murphy -rrb- , operated by tiny unemotional alien people , crash lands face first on liberty island , and it the ship has a mission . the human looking robot , piloted by the captain -lrb- also murphy -rrb- in the head , bumps into gina morrison -lrb- elizabeth banks -rrb- , and gives himself the name dave ming cheng , and he tries to adapt to everything going on , while on this mission . gina 's son josh -lrb- austyn myers -rrb- has a small meteor crash into his bedroom , it is an orb that could determine the future of the alien home planet , and on earth it is capable of collecting all the salt in the sea . dave eventually gets close to the orb , he becomes friends with gina and josh , and the alien crew inside are slowly learning more about emotions they have never experienced . so no. 3 - cultural officer -lrb- gabrielle union -rrb- is starting to feel love , for the captain of course , no. 4 - security officer -lrb- evolution 's pat kilbane -rrb- is becoming camp -lrb- or gay probably -rrb- , and worryingly no. 2 - 2nd in command -lrb- ed helms -rrb- is becoming bad tempered about the mission not getting anywhere . the cops are trying to find the face imprinted in the ground , and the two days to find and throw the orb in the ocean are running out , but in the end , everything comes together , earth is saved and dave blasts away . also starring scott caan as officer dooley , mike o'malley as officer knox , judah friedlander as engineer , marc blucas as mark rhodes and jim turner as doctor . murphy has had a rather appalling set of films in recent years , only shrek kept us interested , this film was a slight improvement , there are some funny and empathetic moments , it is cheesy and a little weird or gross at times , but not a bad science-fiction comedy . murphy won the razzie for worst actor of the decade -lrb- with this , pluto nash and norbit among his films -rrb- , and it was nominated for worst screen couple for murphy in murphy . okay !		4		0
i was expecting better from a woody allen production with a great ensemble cast but this failed with me for a number of reasons . the whole rich uncle , gambling , murder plot was too simplistic and poorly executed , many people have said this movie was rushed and allen could definitely have used another half hour of running time to smooth some edges , develop some `` outs '' , create more rationale behind what was going on . the one bright spot was colin farrell , he did a great london accent and showed his versatility as being able to do more than just `` bad boy '' roles . but the ending was farcical almost and allen chose to throw in shots of the boat and the girlfriends in some manic way of tying everything together , very unsatisfactory and i was thinking aloud `` that 's it ?

when the star quarterback -lrb- paul walker -rrb- of a high school football team is injured , a town and a prestigious coach -lrb- jon voight -rrb- pressure a back-up named john moxon -lrb- james van der beek -rrb- . while dealing with these pressures , his grades and girlfriend -lrb- amy smart -rrb- suffer as he searches for his meaning . varsity blues is an original type of high school football movie in the way that shows the struggles that high school football players face and the pressure put on winning . it realistically shows how the majority of coaches treat their players and how little they care of their future . the problem is that it was not realistic with every other part of the movie . for being such a dramatic story , varsity blues shows some of the most unrealistic football games ever shown . it shows high school life as being one giant orgy and focuses too much on relationships as if it was dawson 's creek . it frequently loses sight of what it promised to be . blues ' humor was as dull and tasteless as something shown on a t.v. show although it repeatedly tried for a laugh . blues took a relatively good plot and turned it around into a teen drama that fails in about every aspect . if you are interested in crappy teen dramas that switches its focus throughout the movie , then this your movie . but if you are interested in a dramatic high school football movie that it portrays to be , watch friday night lights instead . the acting is not only unconvincing but is even bad for actors such as james van der beek and paul walker . trust me , that is bad . the climax of the movie starts off wonderful but ends more cheap and stupid than anyone could imagine . it is totally unpredictable but incredibly stupid . overall , varsity blues will leave you disappointed and fails as a whole . i do not recommend this movie .		4		0
i liked this film a lot . yes it 's a blockbuster , and farrell is n't lead material yet . however this is short and sweet . 80 minutes long , interesting premiss , whitaker and sutherland on good form ; and a d.j shadow track as you 're heading for the foyer .		4		0
it 's been a week since i attended a , screening of `` vampires suck , '' and my usual punctuality in submitting a brief review on imdb was met with a sort of instinctual resistance . ultimately , i felt more than a little unqualified to critique something that pokes fun at a universe i view with indifference : stephenie meyer 's `` twilight '' books -lrb- and the subsequent film franchise -rrb- . while the screening was not my idea -lrb- i agreed to accompany a female friend -rrb- , i took what i knew of the cultural phenomenon -lrb- which is also apparently what the writing/directing duo of jason friedberg and aaron seltzer did -rrb- , lowered my expectations , and prepared for the worst . the verdict ? `` vampires suck '' was n't the terrible waste of time i dreaded it would be : certain bits of crude slapstick connect , as does the subtle -lrb- and rarer -rrb- bits of wordplay ; and jenn proske , who plays the film 's kristen stewart stand-in , absolutely nails the actress 's awkward twitches and lovelorn stares . that being said , this parody coasts largely on the name-brand recognition of its source rather than any genuine comedic impetus : at the end of the day , the name of the game is profiteering off `` twilight '' before the phenomenon loses steam . as such , `` vampires suck '' is an inoffensive -- yet utterly disposable -- bit of cinema . 3.5 out of 10		4		0
wow , talk about a bad night in dr. frankenstein 's hospital emergency room ! this immaculate filth about a mad surgeon who earned a prestigious reputation for separating siamese twins decides to reverse the process . `` gay in amsterdam '' director tom six has gone on record as saying : `` i get a rash from too much political correctness . i love it when films dare to have politically incorrect ideas . '' appropriately enough , nothing in `` the human centipede -- first sequence '' remotely qualifies as politically correct , including its truly warped ending . nevertheless , six displays signs of judicious restraint throughout this horror chiller . spilled blood is held to a minimum until the final shoot-out scene between the police and the mad surgeon in his spacious pool room . six prefers to leave some of his to the imagination . not surprisingly , six worships the work of david cronenberg and pier paolo pasolini . although nothing lunges off the screen at you , this unearthly film could be aptly described as the ultimate 3-d movie : degrading , disgusting , and depraved . the actor who portrays the mad surgeon , dieter laser , looks like the offspring of lance henriksen and benjamin pratt , but he never goes over-the-top . laser definitely has a career in horror movies with his creepy looks . unfortunately , the two american tourists -- actresses ashley c. williams and ashlynn yennie -- are bimbos played by bimbos . mind you , they are playing cookie-cutter stereotypes . akihiro fare better as the japanese tourist katsuro , but how do you list this on your thespian portfolio . `` yes , i played the part of a woman who had her knees mutilated so i had to crawl around on my hands and my mouth -- with most of my teeth removed -- was grafted onto the anus of the actor or actress in front of me . '' nobody is remotely sympathetic in this ghoulish saga , and you 'll find yourself either vomiting or giggling uncontrollably because it is so audaciously sick . the scene where the mad surgeon describes to the victims who he has shanghaied what he plans to do to them anticipates the worse to come . miraculously , one of the gals escapes and scrambles around dr. josef heiter 's clean residence . of course , the howling mad surgeon pursues her with his sedation rifle and warns her that he will extract her teeth without anesthesia and put her in the middle between the crazy japanese guy and her girlfriend . the first third of `` the human centipede '' shows dr. heiter hunting a prospective candidate for his human centipede . as he sits in his car alongside a road and waits for somebody to pull over near him , heiter gazes fondly at his three that he grafted together as one . a trucker pulls off the road to void himself in the wilderness , and the diabolical dr. heiter follows him on foot and shoots him with a dart filled with a drug that knocks him out . later , two clueless american tourists , lindsay -lrb- ashley c. williams of `` willow '' -rrb- and jenny -lrb- ashlynn yennie of `` 2009 evan and gareth are trying to get laid '' -rrb- , get lost searching for a nightclub and wind up in the middle of nowhere . they blow a front tire , and decide to traipse off into the woods after a fat , slimy pervert tries to help them . they wind up at dr. heiter 's villa , and he invites them inside , fakes a phone call to a car repair technician and hands them glasses of chilled water with , the date rape drug , in them . when they awaken after the hideous surgery , they have been grafted to each other at the anus and they can not stand up . kindly dr. heiter feeds them -- or at least the first one -- from a dog bowl and keeps them locked up at night in a long canine cage . eventually , a pair of leather-clad , gray-haired german cops come knocking on his door and all hell breaks loose , including the human centipede . interestingly enough , six says he was inspired to make this film while he was watching a television program about child molesters with his friends . he suggested the heinous child molester should have his mouth grafted to the buttocks of a fat man . six scores major points for taking us where nobody wants to go . moreover , he is preparing a sequel that will surpass this monstrosity . just when you thought that humanity had scraped the bottom of the barrel , you get `` the human centipede -- the first sequence !

this film is about the contrasts of a married couple 's life before and after their marriage . there is a lot of praise for `` blue valentine '' , and michelle williams even got an oscar nomination for best actress . i expected it to be a captivating drama , but i was thoroughly disappointed . i was so bored by the film that i struggled to stay awake . `` blue valentine '' may be a very raw film , with emotions -lrb- and also skin -rrb- exposed bare . the emotional contrast between between the loving times before marriage ; and the cold distant times after marriage is well portrayed . however , what we do not see is why they have progressed this way . the film only shows the beginning and the ending , and the middle is all left out . i think it would have been fulfilling to see what happens in between that leads to the communication and emotional breakdown .		4		0
i 'm a fan of campy grossed out politically incorrect comedies , so films like top secret ! , airplane , hot shots and naked gun , are right up my alley . for some strange reason , i never did watch any of the past scary movies , save for the bits shown in various trailers . and i 'm sad to say that scary movie 4 , is unfortunately , not very funny . sure , it contained the usual barrage of explicit toilet humour , sexual innuendos in the dialogue , and plenty of sight gags involving genitalia , but i guess too much of something will make you sick of it . and that 's what happened with sm4 . the main leads of tom ryan -lrb- craig bierko -rrb- and cindy campbell -lrb- anna faris -rrb- find love despite having to separate because of the tri-pod alien invasion . each took a different path - tom in keeping his family alive during the carnage , while cindy has to undertake a mission to discover the truth behind the invasion , after being tipped off by a japanese ghostly kid who ca n't walk backwards down a staircase . does n't make much sense , does it ? it does n't matter actually , with comedies of this genre . but you got to admire the scriptwriters for almost seamlessly including the many references and scenes from so many thrillers and horror movies , and weave them all into one complete narrative , never mind if it does n't make much sense at the end of the day . it 's not easy collating the recognizable scenes , and piecing them together . the main bulk of references would have to come from spielberg 's war of the worlds , ju-on , saw and the village , just to name a few . real life personalities were also not spared being , like tom cruise , michael jackson , shaquille o'neal and even george w bush -lrb- played by zucker regular leslie nielsen -rrb- . maybe the franchise is running out of steam , or the references the movie pulled from were not very interesting as spoofing material to begin with . i would n't recommend this weak comedy , even though a scary movie 5 has been announced . yikes .		4		0
a kindly but insane scientist is working on a cure for a woman 's paralysis using serum . he experiments using animals until a giant ape escapes from a circus and starts to kill people . karloff -lrb- the scientist -rrb- kills the ape and dresses in its skin to continue killing people and use their serum to continue his work . this was a passable but not particularly special black and white movie with decent acting by karloff , and reasonable supporting performances but little else going for it . the plot was simple and interesting enough , but strangely reminiscent of several other movies of this type that i 've seen . the camera work was adequate but not terribly inspired . overall , my impression was `` meh '' . not a total waste of time but likely only of interest to those who are already fans of this particular type of movie . it wo n't likely do much for anyone else .		4		0
the godfather godfather ii , godfather iii , goodfellas , the untouchables , and casino are all much , much , better than this . the movie stars tom hanks as a mob hit-man and a father . after his son witnesses one of his hits , hanks must hide him from his mob friends . it was kind of predictable and pretty boring . i usually do n't fall asleep at the movies , but i found my self dozing off every few minutes . it is obvious this movie is going to win a bunch of awards because it is a drama with tom hanks . i mean i like tom hanks but i thing he was wrong for this movie . which is a shame because sum of all fears , attack of the clones , and the bourne identity were all better movies this year . a lot of people did like this so i guess it 's up in the air . 4/10		4		0
this is a disaster of a movie with a plot that could have been hilarious . i 'm not sure what went wrong , other than the fact that it seemed unevenly cast and the script was just downright bad . it 's a shame because it 's a great premise . it should have been much , much funnier . instead , it was slow , somewhat mean-spirited , and boring .		4		0
although i am not by any means obsessed with `` south park , '' i do think it 's a very funny show and the film adaptation was hilarious . trey parker and matt stone can be quite funny and i thought certain scenes of `` team america '' were genius . -lrb- and others ... not so much . -rrb- but their second film outing , `` orgazmo , '' has to be their weakest effort . i expected a clever and crude satire of the porn industry -- instead i just got stupid crude humor without many laughs . i did chuckle a few times , at some jokes that were so obvious and over-the-top and juvenile that they hit the funnybone if you 're in an amiable mood . but this is very selective taste and i 'm sure most people would n't even find the silly jokes funny . joe young -lrb- parker -rrb- is a mormon who is recruited to star in a series of porn films called `` orgazmo . '' essentially the film is a kick in the face to religion and caused a lot of controversy when it was released . the mpaa tagged it with an nc-17 rating and it flopped on release . it has a weak cult following now due to the success of parker and stone 's reputations as funny troublemakers , but the fact is that `` orgazmo '' really is just controversial for the sake of being so . it 's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is . on top of that , the new dvd is a huge disappointment also . the cast commentary track is inaudible and barely distinguishable . the `` wild '' commentary track is similarly hard to hear and pretty poor . when i read that kevin smith and weird al yankovic were on the track i thought , `` wow . '' little did i know that they are split into separate groups and only on the track for about ten minutes each . yankovic is the funniest but most of his jokes are lame . smith has never seen `` orgazmo '' and only relays a story of how he used to hate trey parker and matt stone , and his audio is recorded from a telephone conversation . the documentaries are stupid and poor and the rest of the special features are just plain lame . overall , a really disappointing experience .		4		0
the honor has been bestowed upon me to talk about movies for our blog . no need for fanfare , however , as our premiere is not one to write home about . yes , we begin with the underachieving vince vaughn and jennifer aniston -lrb- the conjoined pet name eludes me -rrb- vehicle the break up . curse the trailers for having me say to myself , `` save the date of june 2 for that one . '' i should have seen the warning signs ; i know this now . the film was directed by peyton reed of bring it on fame . wow , that one should have put the nail in the coffin right away . however , he was involved with tv 's cult favorites mr. show and upright citizens brigade , so i gave him the benefit of the doubt . most glaring though , was the pg13 rating . this is usually the kiss of death for a comedy of this kind . it starred vince vaughn , i thought if anyone can make pg13 seem r it 's him . but alas , he could n't . with a cast this top-heavy on names , -lrb- some falsely calling it a `` frat pack '' film , untrue because of the omissions of ferrell , stiller , black , piven and wilson bros. -rrb- , you 'd think the humor , which starts off blazing , could be sustained . instead we get to the point where vaughn 's fast-talking , witty banter turns into loud , obnoxious , rehashed insults . the movie hits a lull during the middle stanza and rather than become comic genius , just ends up falling into the paint-by-numbers romantic comedy we see hollywood churn out every week . most characters are underused . ann-margaret says thank you for the paycheck , joey lauren adams is a from her brilliance in chasing amy , vincent d'onofrio is basically there just to advance a plot point , cole hauser has one funny moment at a night club , justin long is humorous playing a flamboyant secretary -lrb- gets old fast , though -rrb- , and judy davis is wasted in a part where her role 's ego could have allowed for more laughs -lrb- she also looks just plain scary , as age did n't do her well in the 9 years since i last saw her in deconstructing harry -rrb- . the supporting actors each get maybe 10 minutes of screen time for one-dimensional roles that only serve as a quick laugh . aniston is the leading lady , but really just a support herself for vaughn 's antics . vince is center-stage and , in my opinion , just ca n't pull through for an hour and a half . he is the consummate scene-stealer in other performers ' vehicles , but falls flat when he needs to lead . surprisingly , jon favreau does his best vince vaughn by owning every scene he has . the guy acts like a champ , making us laugh even when we are checking our watches during the final act . john michael higgins also comes through , especially with his rendition of yes 's owner of a lonely heart . overall the starting laughs are great . however , you do n't pay theatre prices for less than half a movie . wait on this one until it comes to video in 5 months or so . instead check out great understated and nuanced performances from vaughn and d'onofrio in last year 's dramedy thumbsucker , or revisit vaughn 's breakthrough role as he delivers on a favreau penned script in the great swingers , -lrb- `` watch me make gretzky 's head bleed for super fan 99 over there '' -rrb- , so money it knows it .		4		0
this starts with a man wearing a tux getting killed by some slavic gangsters at a nu-metal gig . it 's never mentioned on screen but the implication is that the dead man is bond , james bond and throughout the movie where treated to an alternative universe where the world is no longer saved by sophisticated suave secret agents but saved by a loud crass extreme sports loving american did i use the word '' treated '' in the above paragraph ? maybe that 's too much of a strong word because xxx is n't much of a treat . okay i disagree with many of the people claiming this was the worst movie of 2002 but rob cohen is a very shallow director while vin diesel is a laughably bad actor who makes sylvester stallone look like anthony hopkins in comparison . what compounds this problem is the amount of homage the movie pays to the bond series . is n't this movie trying to do away with bond ? so why does xander cage borrow lines like '' the things i do for my country '' which sounds a lot like '' the things i do for england '' from you only live twice . all throughout the movie we 're treated -lrb- again that 's maybe not the right word -rrb- to little nods and winks to fleming 's superhero which makes the movie end up being a 21st century homage to jb and i doubt if this was the original intension . the story structure mirrors that of the franchise of cramming in several different locations because it seemed like a good idea at the time , so much so you find yourself forgetting what the original plot was , there 's a femme fatale and the bad guy wants to start effectively world war three . seen it all before xxx is dumb , loud and spectacular when it needed some wit and a better leading man . if your only requirement in a movie is stunts and explosions you 'll no doubt enjoy it but i do prefer substance in a movie		4		0
in the outlandish dark comedy super , james gunn has created what is perhaps the definitive take on self-reflexive superheroes . when sad-sack loser frank -lrb- rainn wilson -rrb- sees his ex-addict wife -lrb- liv tyler -rrb- willingly snatched by a seductive drug dealer -lrb- kevin bacon -rrb- , he finds himself bereft and wholly unable to cope . but soon he decides to fight back under the guise of a diy superhero called crimson bolt . with a hand-made suit , a wrench , and a crazed sidekick named boltie -lrb- ellen page -rrb- , the crimson bolt beats his way through the mean streets of crime in hopes of saving his wife . the rules were written a long time ago : you are not supposed to molest children , cut lines or key cars ; if you do , prepare to face the wrath of the crimson bolt ! no stranger to rebel filmmaking , james gunn cut his teeth writing for troma before making his directing debut with 2006 's slither . in a similar vein , his follow-up feature combines absurd humor with balls-out violence to create something that is both unashamed and inimitable . but this time gunn adds a new ingredient , one that is dark , dramatic and subversive to the core . what was that ? what did i just saw ? a really weird movie . yes . this movie started like a cult comedy feel but it ended up bad . everything in this movie was just so all over the place . its a off beat indie dark comedy that ends up quite silly . i think the director and the writers did n't handled it quite well . there are some scenes that will be like totally insanely crazy . rainn wilson as frank is a guy his wife leaves him , he is a bit of loser like , he gets visions , becomes a superhero with no powers but costumes and starts fighting crime by hitting criminals over their heads . he is joined by a girl boltie played by my favorite ellen page she becomes his sidekick . frankie 's wife sarah played by liv tyler is with the bad guy jacques played by kevin bacon who is her . they end up doing what they wanted but ending has a bit of twist . directed by james gunn who is unknown to me . this movie could have been good but the director did n't handled it quite well , it ends up going in opposite directions . so below average direction . screenplay had flaws it was n't tight but very loose and hollow . story was nice a kick . everything else was okay . i would say not recommended , you may find it a bit well but i did n't liked it . the movie is also quite graphic with extreme violent and bloody scenes . some gross humor . it does n't end up as dark comedy , a small wannabe superhero movie , an off beat comedy or a cult movie but it ends up as a confused all over the place weird movie . i did n't liked it .		4		0
i 'll start by saying that i have no sense of loyalty to sam raimi 's spider-man films . the first two were fun enough , but they were very campy and i have plenty of problems with each of them . i certainly did n't have anywhere near enough of an appreciation of them for me to have an initial problem with the idea of the amazing spider-man , a reboot of the franchise with a new director -lrb- -lrb- 500 -rrb- days of summer 's marc webb taking over from raimi -rrb- and new leading actor -lrb- andrew garfield in place of tobey maguire -rrb- . the idea to restart a series only ten years after it began , and only five years after the most recent installment , was an interesting one and i was confident that they would only be doing it if they felt they had a fresh new take on the material . so , with that in mind , going into the amazing spider-man i had a lot of promise . which is one of the many reasons why after having seen it , i came out feeling so disappointed . not only does the amazing spider-man not justify its existence coming so soon after raimi 's trilogy , but it practically insults the audience by teasing the idea of actually taking things in a different approach before succumbing to the most basic of superhero blockbuster structures . we begin with a promising look into peter parker 's family life , seeing him abandoned by his parents and getting a little taste that there are some shades to his father that will be explored later . the problem being that they are n't explored at all , instead taking a backseat to a hopelessly thin and generic villain plot and then finally being shoved back in at the last possible moment just to give the audience a reason to come back for a sequel . this is a fault that permeates through much of the amazing spider-man , as seemingly important characters are introduced , given weight and then promptly dismissed and plot strands are opened up and never resolved or just lazily left open for future installments . it feels like half of a picture at times , or at least two halves of separate ones that are awkwardly crammed together . the running time is much too long , clocking in at over two hours when it could have easily been trimmed down under that mark and been made a much more swiftly paced endeavor as a result . the script is one of its bigger obstacles , as we not only see plenty of moments far too similar to ones we witnessed only ten years ago , but practically the entire back half of the picture feels all too familiar . characters are replaced with others , but when they serve the exact same function they end up feeling just like that -- replacements . the amazing spider-man begins with the potential of giving a new take on the popular webslinger , but it so quickly gives up on any sense of originality and becomes as tired a routine as many feared it would be . perhaps the one thing that does really work for it is the recasting of the lead , with andrew garfield taking on a more confident and open version of parker that i found myself investing a lot more in on an emotional level . the romantic plot with gwen stacy -lrb- played by emma stone -rrb- fell incredibly flat for me , but i found the depiction of parker as a boy finding his identity to be quite impressiveness . thanks in large part to garfield 's strength as an actor , scenes between him and some members of the supporting cast , particularly dennis leary as gwen 's father , held a solid impact for me . strange that the relationship between parker and leary 's captain stacy was much more interesting and emotional than that of the romantic leads . webb does n't seem to have what it takes to handle a bigger production like this either , as the pacing is off practically from the start and the tone shifts too drastically from one moment to the next . for every scene that i felt balanced the humor and darkness incredibly well -lrb- again , thanks majorly to garfield 's work at the center -rrb- , there was another that felt out of place with the rest of the film . most of the more character-driven moments did n't have the weight that they should have because the script did n't focus enough time and attention on developing these characters outside of parker , but the action sequences were even worse as they felt like less impressive repetitions of things we 've seen plenty of times by now . perhaps it 's unfair to think that the amazing spider-man was required to justify its own existence , but when you decide to reboot a series that ended only five years ago that is just a check you have to be able to cash . unfortunately this film is n't capable of doing that , and instead looks more than anything like a shameless studio attempt to continue milking a franchise that was in danger of being wiped out .		4		0
in my review of another cuba gooding jnr movie men of honor i mentioned the movie tries too hard to impress the oscar board in the hope of getting a few awards . i had the exact same feeling watching this movie . everything seems to whallop us over the head as it screams '' please mister academy award person - give us some oscars '' the story itself is one of those of the human will type plots with the main character having some sort of social / psychological impediment ala rainman etc with lots of sentimental scenes that on paper may have appeared touching but on screen seem rather forced , unconvincing and mawkish there also seems to be another problem of what instinct is trying to be . it ` s difficult not to notice its attempt to be an awards movie but is it also trying to be something else ? is it in fact trying to be a gritty prison drama also ? i think it might be via the sometimes brutish guards and the man mountain convict with the obsession for the ace of diamonds but this aspect makes the entire production feel confused and unfocussed i noted in the trivia section that sean connery turned down the role of ethan and this was probably a good idea since he appears in far too many productions that seem ill thought out -lrb- instinct would have been no different in that respect -rrb- but anthony hopkins seems a bizarre replacement . the reason hopkins is rightly well regarded as an actor is down to one main thing - his voice . strange that he was cast as ethan when the character doesn ` t utter a word until almost half way through the movie		4		0
a year after he directed the `` thirteen ghosts '' remake , steve beck directed `` ghost ship '' , about ... well , the title says it all . most of the movie is totally predictable , although francesca -lrb- francesca rettondini -rrb- is one ghost whom i would n't mind meeting . even so , there 's absolutely nothing special about the movie . the best movies of recent years are john sayles 's `` limbo '' and christopher nolan 's `` insomnia '' . the andrea doria * did n't need tribute paid to it like this . probably just a way for gabriel byrne , julianna margulies , ron eldard and desmond harrington to make a quick buck , knowing full well what kind of a movie they were starring in . pretty bad . yeah , francesca was one hot ghost ! * more recently , of course , there was the costa concordia .		4		0
i read the book some years ago and thought it funny , clever , imaginative ... all things the film is not . apart from the title and a tiny , tiny part for wallace there is almost no similarity to the original story . hence one wonders why on earth they bothered making this . surely if you turn a book into a movie you need to keep something from the original story , apart from the title ?! carrey is clearly not the man he once was , and at his best his ott style is not for everyone anyway . i thought it odd to pair him with deschanel who is young enough to be his daughter , although she at least brings some quirky charm to the proceedings . it 's not really a bad film in the grand scheme of things , and there are some funny moments , but for anyone coming to this after reading the book i suggest you prepare for disappointment .		4		0
writer-director john waters enjoys teasing and tickling his audiences by putting actors -lrb- such as kathleen turner here -rrb- in incredibly gaudy comedic situations and encouraging them to go-for-broke . but this gambit of his does n't always work out for the best -- and if turner 's career had n't already peaked by 1994 and the time of `` serial mom '' , this picture certainly would have helped bring down her cache in hollywood . it 's a deliberately cheap and bizarro mix of camp laughs and grotesque shocks , as psycho suburban mom turner eliminates anyone in the neighborhood who stands in her family 's way . waters writes pulpy scenes and cartoony bits which are then lumped together like mismatched puzzle pieces ; there 's no flow to his direction , while his rhythm -lrb- always erratic -rrb- muffles the verbal and visual punchlines . turner was apparently enticed enough to tear into the project with relish , however she does more for the movie than it does for her . * 1/2 from ****		4		0
this was not a good film , it was n't even a good horror film . the first child 's play has scenes of actual suspense , but this one is more jokey than anything else . some of the characters do die in fairly novel ways , but chucky does n't seem to have the zest that he had in the original . there are some good special effects , especially towards the end of the film , and the puppetry being chucky was excellent , but it seemed a bit of a waste of time . if they were going to put all this money and effort into making sure the special effects were good , then they really should have made sure they had some kind of storyline , and some reason to make the film . as it stands the film seems cold , with as much inspiration in at as a mcdonalds commercial . stick to the first one only , if you are going to watch any of the chucky films .		4		0
bruno : 4 out of 10 : i have to admit i am more than a bit disappointed here . bruno has its share of laugh out loud moments but it simply does not have those great memorable scenes that made borat such a treat . one can not help comparing bruno to borat since in many ways they are the same story . borat worked because the character was , at least on a movie logic level , believable . he was played as an innocent whom one could root for ; even if he had some terrible values upon reflection . he was a lovable character . while borat has an innocent air about him and a charismatic travelling companion , bruno is as characterized a horrible human being from the get go with a milquetoast traveling companion . bruno is a flamboyantly gay austrian fashion host that is so horrible , one simply feels nothing but sympathy for sacha baron cohen 's victims . when you start feeling sorry for ron paul and anti-homosexual christian the movie has clearly gone of the rails . cohen tries to infuse bruno with countless shots of male to embarrass -lrb- one supposes -rrb- his audience , alas none if it is as cringe inducing as the naked wresting from the first movie -lrb- come to think of it , nothing on earth is as cringe inducing as that scene -rrb- and nothing in bruno comes anywhere close to being that funny . while there are certainly scattered laughs throughout the film , bruno is more in the style of an old mondo cane movie than a comedy . it is more about making the audience and his victims uncomfortable than provoking any mirth or insight . when i watched borat , i would tell myself if i met the character on the street i would be polite to him as well . while watching bruno i was shocked no one punched him in the face .		4		0
i really do n't know what the big deal is . this is obviously another one of those `` highly intellectual '' movies i am too stupid to understand . the critics compare it to `` the godfather '' ... i find that to be sacrilegious ! i agree with one critic only when he states that the film `` presents meaningless issues in an and almost lyrical fashion '' , and i would like to put a big emphasis on meaningless !!! how can something meaningless be good ? another famous critic , roger ebert , claims `` seeing this movie last may at the cannes film festival , i knew it was either one of the year 's best films , or one of the worst . tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie , but he could possibly make a bad one ... '' that is amazing ! one of the world 's most acclaimed film critics watches a ` masterpiece ' , and right after that can not decide whether it is really a masterpiece or garbage ? then he goes on to say , ` oh , but it ca n't be garbage if such an made it , so it must be a masterpiece ' . so much for competent individual judgment ... i suppose you would not be able to call yourself a critic if you wrote that tarantino simply screwed up this time ... in my opinion , the film has a ton of famous actors , an `` in '' director , and nothing else . the plot is practically non-existent , there is no message , no `` higher '' meaning , nothing but violence for the sake of violence ... , and above all , it does not entertain either ! if this is art nowadays , i want to go back to the past !		4		0
i was initially disappointed in knowing this film was going to be rated pg-13 , in an effort to soak up all teenagers the producers could muster . all of the alien and predator films were rated `` r '' for a very good reason . and anyone who felt and understood the horror , suspense , disgust , etc. from the work of those films would have shook their head -lrb- just as i did -rrb- at the mere mention of a pg-13 rating . to combine some of the fictitious universe 's most feared creatures and have them go head-to-head under a pg-13 rating is almost comical . nonetheless , i watched avp and was pretty impressed for about half the film . the big fight scene with an alien and a predator was definitely the best of the whole film . the director managed to execute all the gore and mayhem he could without really getting too explicit . quite a bit of the violence is actually suggested . i guess after having seen the alien quadrilogy , you really do n't need to see a bunch of facehuggers jump on people to know what 's about to happen . but even with these `` saving graces '' to do the film credit , the second half -lrb- normally the more important of the two -rrb- peters out big time . instead of getting a massive battle of a bunch of predators fighting a swarm of aliens , -lrb- spoiler -rrb- we see one predator and a woman fleeing from an explosion that takes out all the aliens . and just to show how hollywood sometimes never changes , we get a repeat of `` aliens '' with the queen alien surviving the explosion . a final battle ensues with the predator and woman taking on the . maybe there just was n't the budget to execute one of the best `` versus '' battles out there , because this film could have easily added another thirty minutes to an hour of footage . i think too much time was wasted in showing the human expedition team trying to the temple . and the whole bit of using the aliens as part of predator warrior training was a bit hokey , but not near as hokey as the ending . can anyone say `` predalien '' ? 4/10		4		0
they were already showing trailers of upcoming movies when we came in . i was very surprised to discover that all three of the movies previewed all had 3d trailers ! these were `` coraline '' , `` up ! '' and `` meatballs '' . the studios really have to go the extra mile to ensure people will still be watching in theaters . as for `` monsters vs. aliens , '' i frankly did not like the movie too much . the monster characters who are supposed to be the good guys are not too memorable or cute . even my 7-year old son found the character of link and to be `` corny '' . the character of is rather `` meh '' , with a predictable character arc . on the other hand , there were also positives . the main bad guy alien gallaxhar , a sinister squid with 4 eyes , was more interesting . the artwork of the alien spaceship interior were also more interesting . the character of the us president was the only thing that is really funny , especially the scene where he makes first contact with the alien probe , and that stupid scene at the end of the credits . but of course , the best thing about this movie is the 3d . i think i would have dozed off if not for these special 3d effects . but then as the trailers have shown with all these upcoming 3d animated features , this trend may not be something extra special anymore in the future .		4		0
i 've never understood the star power of tim allen . it 's not that i dislike him , i just do n't get the appeal . this entry is a very 90 's - hip version of the santa claus tale , complete with child custody and visitation issues . workaholic tim gets into replacing the current santa clause on legal technicality . i may be alone , but i thought the plot progression from there was disquieting , unpleasant and just plain bizarre . maybe i missed the point , but i did n't think much of this film .		4		0
i figured that this would be primarily a special-effects movie , so i did n't have high expectations . unfortunately , those expectations were n't met . i had hoped that solid acting by dennis quaid and jake gyllenhaal could make this a character-driven action movie . the writing and direction removed any hope of that . when watching the movie , i was surprised to find that the acting of quaid and gyllenhaal was quite bad . since i hold these actors in high regard , i blame the script . it quickly digressed into unimaginably simplistic melodrama . perhaps the actors had as much problem believing the dialog as i did . for crying out loud , they even threw in a kid with cancer as a whorish attempt to generate some emotion , although it added nothing to the plot . the special effects were exceptional . if that is sufficient for you to enjoy a movie , this is a movie for you . if you require good character development and a creative script as i do , then this movie is likely to fall well short .		4		0
the most realistic films still take liberties with the boring , awkward and non-dramatic aspects of life . there 's no way to get around it if you want to compress a story into a couple of hours . likewise , films with the most outlandish of premises still need to construct a surface logic for what happens . it does n't have to be a deep or thorough logic and it 's perfectly fine for someone to watch a movie and then , several hours later , to realize that some or most of it made no sense . what you can not do is tell a story where the plot is so poorly designed and the concept so obviously contradictory and silly that viewers do n't just have to suspend disbelief , they have to annihilate it down to the sub-atomic level . vanishing on 7th street is a motion picture with no logic , surface or otherwise . this is the sort of thing where every 5 minutes you 're saying to the screen `` are you kidding me ? '' there are so many fundamental problems with the script that i do n't understand how it ever got produced . let 's start with the most basic flaws . vanishing on 7th street is about this mysterious force that is able to not only instigate city or possibly world wide blackouts , but it can affect the laws of nature to keep the sun from rising in the sky . think about the kind of power and purpose that unavoidably implies . and yet , this mysterious force is helpless before the awesome might of the energizer bunny , scented candles and glow sticks . it can knock out a city power grid , but is stymied by a broken down , generator . this mysterious force is also able to make hundreds of thousands , maybe millions of people vanish in an instant . yet when it comes to just 4 individuals , it can only creep toward them slightly faster than the tide . those 4 individuals also spend 3 days trying to stay in the light so the mysterious force ca n't make them disappear . in those 3 days , however , it never occurred to them that you can get all the light you need just by setting stuff on fire . i could go on , but do i need to ? writer anthony jaswinski clearly did n't spend a lick of time actually gaming out the implications and/or consequences of his idea and just as clearly assumed no one else would either . those kind of logic gaffes are n't the only thing wrong with this movie . director brad anderson plays the same dynamic out so many times that he comes off like someone with obsessive compulsive disorder . here is how pretty much every supposedly scary moment goes in vanishing on 7th street . 1 . the lights flicker . 2 . the shadows approach . 3 . the lights come back on -lrb- or not -rrb- . the first time or two that happens , it 's kind of frightening . by the fifth or the 8th or the umpteenth time , it 's only tedious . imagine if in jaws , the shark came by every 10 minutes and almost ate someone but then swam away . that 's what this is like . let me give you another example . hayden christensen 's character is established at the start as someone who 's only out for himself and willing to let people get vanished rather than help them . as you might guess , he has to undertake a hero 's journey and learn to risk his own life to protect others . the thing is , he completes that journey in the first 15 minutes of the film and has nothing to do but repeat the process over and over again . then at the end , when he does sacrifice himself to try and save another , he has to do it because the other person is being a total moron . christensen 's character dies because of this other person 's stupidity , and then the audience is left alone with that other character on screen for the rest of the movie . why should the viewer care what happens to him ? he got anakin skywalker killed ! if the audience feels anything at that moment , it 's resentment toward the surviving character but that appears to have escaped these filmmakers . vanishing on 7th street is strikingly dumb at its core , without any explosions , nudity or graphic violence to make up for that . if that sounds like your cup of tea , have at it .		4		0
i can only imagine the pitch . young , eager director tom six walks in , anxious to impress potential producers . `` so what 's it about ? '' asks one of the . six looks awkward , shuffling his feet . `` er . . it 's about this mad scientist who specialises in siamese twin separation , who abducts these girls . he kinda has this obsession and dream about stitching people together . he wants to join three people together , connected by their mouth and a ** , and treat them like a dog . '' the producers look at each confused , and the one drops a bag on the table full of money . `` here 's two million dollars , '' he says , `` go make a f ***** g movie ! '' and yes , that is what the film is about . this is probably the maddest idea i 've ever heard , which got me extremely intrigued . that , along with the minor media storm that was caused upon it 's uk release , meant it was a film i had to see . not since the glory days of grindhouse has such a crazy idea been released to mainstream audiences . yet for all its ` potential ' it falls rather flat on it 's face . first of all , there are things to enjoy about the film . the crazy surgeon at the centre of it all , dr. heiter -lrb- dieter laser -rrb- , has one of the most unusual faces i 've ever seen , and therefore makes a great horror villain . his stoic and nazi-like behaviour is hilarious , sometimes unnerving , and often very camp . there 's definitely a little udo kier about him . the surgery scenes , and the inevitable `` oh no , i need to s ** t ! '' moment are delightfully cringe-inducing , and watching heiter gaze longingly at a picture of his dead -lrb- work it out -rrb- is just plain weird . yet at the heart of it all , it 's nothing more than a run-of-the-mill horror , with dragged-out set pieces , an overlong scene , and a rather poor climax . the eventual unveiling of his creation is also rather tame , with the key gruesome areas covered up -lrb- the fact that i would want to see a mouth stitched to an a ** worries me -rrb- . i 'd like to say it 's a missed opportunity , but i do n't if an opportunity was ever there . i mean , how good can a film be where the victims are joined through the gastric system and are forced to s ** t in each others mouths ? saying all that , i will be watching the sequel . www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com		4		0
i never liked this segment and the new viewing does n't change anything : it 's dull and flat as all rescue stories . it 's a galactic baywatch , without the `` talent '' of pamela ! if davis is a fine substitute for saavik and `` doc '' the best klingon ever , the magic of trek eludes me there . the audio commentary says that in a trilogy , the middle part is always the weakest or hardest because the audience loses the excitement of the original surprise and lacks the pleasure of the ending climax . well , i remember to have seen excellent `` part ii '' movies : back to the future , superman , empire strikes back , war of the clones , aliens ! here , i think the explanation comes the empty seat for spock that tells a lot of the importance of the character . thus my reluctance to see next generation , explorer , deep space , enterprise shows and my pleasure to go to the revamping of the original series in 2009 . that 's makes me aware of a strange fact : as a child or a teen , we never went to a trek movie in spite my parents are really cool about movies . but it 's true than in france , trek have n't the same glamor than star wars , maybe because the merchandising was quite nonexistent . i discovered trek , show and movies , with the defunct tv channel `` la cinq '' thus around the beginning of the nineties that 's is to say the end of this wonderful story of filmmaking . thus , just warp 10 to st 4 !		4		0
they make these tribes people seem like every day schmoes ... there is even a few testicle jokes in here for all you absent minded morons ... the dialog was so corny at every moment . the acting was horrendous as well . especially the role of the lead antagonist . it was entertaining to an extent , ill say that . but if i could go back and have an opportunity to not watch this movie , i would gladly exchange my two hours for a chance to view a real movie . this movie was nothing more then a hollywood glorification at the simple life of the tribes folk . che guevara is not only a jerk , but an air head as well . this movie reminded me a lot of scientology ... it was really full of crap .		4		0

i somehow missed the first one , a remake of a pretty decent drive-in cannibal flick from the 1970s . this sequel follows a bunch of military types on exercise in the desert when they run afoul of a flesh-eating mutant clan . so much of the running time is spent wandering around caves and mine shafts , with very little else going on , after awhile i thought i was watching an episode of dirty jobs . seriously , if you 're looking for a good gore flick , do n't stop here . watch one of the saw movies or high tension instead . there is some gore here , but not nearly enough . there 's also a rape scene , but do n't be misled by what you may have heard : it 's more suggested than shown . the acting is predictably atrocious . and while the mutants were n't bad-looking , i prefer the mutants in wrong turn . those guys had looks and personality !		4		0
i find it hard to believe that the current rating for this movie is 6.5 . i can understand that there are a lot of zombie and gore fans but i can not understand why people are satisfied with such cliché and predictable plots . this movie offers absolutely nothing new except making zombies out of nazis . the classic story of evil dead -lrb- funny because one of the characters actually mentions evil dead , it is such an obvious tribute -rrb- bunch of young people going up to the mountains to stay at a cabin and they get attacked by zombies who are supposedly the nazi soldiers who took refuge in the forest during world war ii . yes , there is a lot of gratuitous gore , people 's faces always covered with blood -lrb- not sure why they would n't wash their faces with snow , that to me would be an instinct -rrb- but i guess these guys like blood on their faces . also , not sure why anyone would want to fight with a zombie knowing that you can not actually defeat a zombie by beating him up -lrb- common knowledge -rrb- . this movie reminded me of `` the cabin fever '' , a similar attempt at making something new by using old familiar horror elements . there are so many stupid moments in the movie , i am not sure i remember them all . these guys have cell phone but for some strange reason they do n't think of using it until they burn down the cabin . a zombie sticks his fingers in the nose of one of the victims , and opens up his head like a melon , i mean the victim 's head cracks open in the middle like a melon ; in another scene bunch of zombies tear up the limbs of a victim , not sure how that is physically possible . i know zombies are not supposed to be realistic but that should n't mean every physical law should be compromised -lrb- the original night of the living dead was pretty good -rrb- . only 4 points that i give is because of the location they used -lrb- makes it interesting , a zombie movie in the snow -rrb- , and some scenes are pretty well-crafted for a picture . other than , this is a mediocre movie . you wo n't find anything new in the story .		4		0

`` scream '' trilogy director wes craven must have been brushing up on his slasher movie skills for his forthcoming `` scream 4 '' when he decided to make his latest thriller `` my soul to take . '' this strictly sophomoric exercise in murder and mayhem in a high school setting with a capable cast of no-name teens qualifies as a rental when you have a free movie coupon . surprisingly , writer & director wes craven has penned and helmed a predictable as well as generic serial killer thriller that lacks everything that made the `` scream '' movies so memorable as well as satirical . worse , `` my soul to take '' is another one of those 3-d movies that was n't lensed in 3-d , but was converted to 3-d like `` clash of the titans . '' in other words , the 3-d effects -- even in a digital presentation -- are n't as visually dynamic as genuine 3-d effects . meaning , nothing comes flying out of the screen at you like either ` my bloody valentine '' or `` resident evil : afterlife . '' `` my soul to take '' generates some atmosphere , but this 107 minute , r-rated nonsense never musters any compelling characters , spine-tingling suspense , or even a big last-minute surprise . if you 're the kind of person that spots the killer long before the movie outs the slayer , you 'll quickly tire of this unexceptional epic . `` my soul to take '' opens with some promise . a happily married husband and father , abel -lrb- raúl esparza of `` find me guilty '' -rrb- , is putting the finishing touches on a wooden rocking horse in his downstairs workshop when his pregnant wife asks him to join her upstairs . meanwhile , it seems that a television newscast about a savage serial killer in riverton , massachusetts , appropriately nicknamed the `` riverton ripper , '' is making abel 's wife feel paranoid . as he is leaving his workshop , abel slips on a tool on the floor and smacks his head on a work bench and he goes down . upstairs , the wife learns from the newscast that the authorities can not identify the killer even though he has been recorded on a surveillance camera . nevertheless , they have been able to magnify the murder weapon sufficiently to make out the word ` vengeance ' on the blade . abel spots the exact same knife with ` vengeance ' on the blade under his work bench and his multiple personalities -- triggered by the fall -- kick in . abel realizes that he is in deep trouble . abel 's murderous personality warns him that he will kill his entire family if he calls his doctor . abel phones his physician , dr. blake -lrb- harris yulin of `` scarface '' -rrb- , and he warns him what is happening . before the police arrive , abel kills his wife and is about to stab his daughter when riverton detective paterson -lrb- frank grillo of `` pride and glory '' -rrb- bursts in and shoots abel twice . like any worthwhile serial killer , this maniac does n't just lie down and die . he fools paterson , disarms him and shoots him twice in the chest , but paterson wears a bullet-proof vest . in the ambulance , on the way to the hospital , abel slips out of his restraints and slashes away at the ambulance nurse . the ambulance driver swerves from all the sudden hysterics and the vehicle flips over near a river . the ambulance bursts into flames as paterson and the nurse barrel out of it and abel manages to escape into the night . the authorities never find a trace of him . the action fast-forwards to sixteen years after the incident . a crowd of teenagers are holding a late night ceremony near the burned out remains of the ambulance with dozens of glowing candles illuminating the vehicle . the teens are observing what they have come to call `` ripper night . '' as it turns out , the night when the abel went on a killing spree in his house occurred about the same time that seven children were prematurely born . the premise is that one of the kids may have wound up with the soul of the missing murderer . our protagonist bug -lrb- max thieriot of `` the astronaut farmer '' -rrb- , who is rumored to have been institutionalized for mental instability , his mischievous buddy , alex -lrb- john magaro of `` the box '' -rrb- ; a popular girl named brittany -lrb- television actress paulina olszynski -rrb- ; a lewd jock brandon -lrb- nick lashaway of `` the last song '' -rrb- ; spiritually religious penelope -lrb- zena grey of `` the shaggy dog '' -rrb- ; blind jerome -lrb- denzel whitaker of `` the great debaters '' -rrb- ; and asian-american jay -lrb- jeremy chu of `` mr. deeds -rrb- , who winds up being the first victim , constitute the `` riverton seven . '' indeed , jay is crossing a bridge on his way home when the masked killer with reminiscent of the alien in the `` predator '' movies kills him . a day later the authorities find his body . not long afterward , zena is attacked in the generator room adjacent to a school swimming pool . two other teens bite the dust as we learn that bug survived the death of his mother in the womb . bug has his own set of problems that include migraines as well as a way to see dead people in a mirror . nothing about `` my soul to take '' is either scary or suspenseful . mind you , the performances are pretty good , but craven does n't distinguish himself . `` my soul to take '' is every bit as forgettable as craven 's second-rate `` cursed '' and never up half the tension of `` red eye . '' ultimately , the slasher here referred to as the `` riverton ripper '' is n't very terrifying in comparison with either hockey mask clad jason of the `` friday the 13th '' franchise or michael myers of the `` halloween . '' the slasher attacks are timed when you least expect them , but craven does n't give his mass murderer anything in the way of traits or an attitude to make him intimidating . worse , anybody who ever saw the classic marx brothers ' comedy `` duck soup '' will spot a rip-off of the mirror scene between groucho and harpo . the only thing that gets taken in `` my soul to take '' is your money and your time .		4		0
whoa , what the hell did i just watch ? stuff like this makes you think . makes you really wonder what goes on in people 's minds . of all the possible movies to finance and scripts to green-light , was this the box office sensation menahem golan and globus thought they 'd hit the big time with ? the golden goose they shelled out $ 25m to produce ? thank god they did . if a b-grade studio like cannon had to go bankrupt for our cheesy enjoyment , then so be it . on the other hand it might explain why the movie goes completely #t after a relatively sensible first hour . they probably realized a movie about a foxy space vampire who is the most feminine presence the protagonist has ever met and who spends most of the movie buck naked and generally being as foxy and feminine as possible , stopping only to speak through patrick stewart 's mouth and suck the ` lifeforce ' out of her hapless victims , was n't really going to be the new jaws , so they decided to throw inside everything $ could buy them and hope for the best . what does $ buy you ? a lot . and since this is the eighties we 're talking about , it buys you a lot of coke and amphetamines for one thing . did the catering service provide nothing but drugs and caffeine ? i ca n't explain the acting otherwise . steve railsback for example spends all of his time on screen yelling like a psychotic * beep * at people . hilarious , nonsensical , dialogue fills the cracks . `` this woman is a masochist ! an extreme masochist ! '' should have won an award for something . `` do n't worry , a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex '' is so good it should 've won an oscar for best screenplay all by itself . hooper seems to be making four movies all in the same time . after the poltergeist debacle and his ongoing drug problems -lrb- refer to the above -rrb- , the guy probably thought it was his last time directing a movie . so why not make a zombie flick , a space sci-fi horror flick , a paranoid psychological thriller and an apocalyptic action movie all in one ? can you imagine the amount of clunkers this pioneering technique would have saved us ? ulli lommel 's entire filmography condensed in 120 minutes would at last allow world powers to concentrate their efforts on finding a solution for third world poverty . lifeforce starts out somewhere between clinical 2001 : a space odyssey interiors and sweeping space shots -lrb- also , giant passages into the space vampire spaceship that make the protagonist think he 's been there before -rrb- , mumbo jumbo about a nerva engine that saves you that zero-gravity soundstage you 'd have to build and `` let 's explore that mysterious thing that is probably full of deadly space monsters '' escapades . before the end credits roll however , london has turned into an apocalyptic battlefield , vampire zombies running amok all over the place while a space vampire adonis that looks like he missed his way to an after shave commercial is sucking blue lasers out of the people of london , funneling them into his spaceship orbiting around earth . these blue lasers are the souls of people . when the vampire adonis is injured the blue lasers turn red . and i did n't even mention anything about the prime minister sucking the lifeforce out of his secretary . or exploding zombie vampires . or a foxy space vampire being summoned out of patrick stewart 's blood in the middle of a helicopter . or ... yeah . you can make up a lot of nonsense with $ 25m .		4		0
someone thought why do n't we take charles dickens a christmas carol and take tiny bits of last years maid of honor , and you get ghosts of girlfriends past . a good idea that quickly goes nowhere , it 's not all funny , but mildly amusing at times . connor mead -lrb- matthew mcconaughey -rrb- a famous photographer that has pretty much slept with a lot of women , some are clients . is invited to be best man at his brother pauls -lrb- breckin meyer -rrb- wedding . during that time he meets up with an old child hood friend and former lover jenna -lrb- jennifer garner -rrb- , and pretty much begins hitting on most of the brides maid . but is quickly visited by the ghost of his rich uncle -lrb- michael douglas -rrb- , and tells him that he will be visited by three ghosts , in hopes that they will make him see the error of his ways . although the idea was good , but it went nowhere , cause it had very little laughs . matthew mcconaughey does n't show much here in this role , he is so unlikable and makes it impossible to care about him . jennifer garner really surprised me here , she gave a real strong performance , and her performance was not week like it was in catch and release -lrb- 2006 -rrb- . and she and mcconaughey have very little chemistry . now emma stone is pretty much a scene stealer as the ghost of girlfriends past , she got some laughs . but michael douglas 's character began to wear out his presence . a little note : christa b. allen who plays teenage jenna , also starred in 13 going on 30 -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , in which she also played a teenage version of jennifer garner character .		4		0
in charles bronson 's fourth outing as vigilante killer paul kersey in death wish 4 : the crackdown , he 's hired by mysterious millionaire john p. ryan for his professional services . the daughter of female companion kay lenz just died from an overdose and bronson killed the person responsible . ryan tells bronson he 's had a similar tragedy in his family , but with his connections and bronson 's skill he can really do a lot of damage to the drug trafficking in los angeles . so bronson is off to do his thing . but all is definitely not as it seems . especially since he 's now taking on a higher level of than just street punks as he did in the previous three death wish movies . in the three previous death wish films bronson has gone up the scale in terms of ingenuity in his public service homicides . he 's not just a guy with a large gun any longer . you would definitely think that bronson did this full time instead of just a sideline with his real job being an architect . but let 's just say the wool is truly pulled over his eyes in death wish 4 : the crackdown in a way i certainly could n't believe . it makes the film quite unreal and down right dumb at times . it 's the weakest of the death wish series and let 's let it go at that .		4		0

the x-files series is dead , and this the x-files : i want to believe is its burial ceremony ! my hopes were n't very high but i was expecting something better after all these years . make a second film for that ? why ? any regular episode of the series is better than this `` large episode '' ... the fans of the series might like it and i do n't blame them , but in fact i think this film was totally unnecessary . well , the main topic of the plot -lrb- `` the frankenstein doctor '' ... -rrb- is not bad , but all the rest is not that good , at all ! the film is too slowly paced , the action scenes are just a few and not well done , the main characters are truly old and wasted , and there 's a subplot that seems to increase nothing to the movie except drama , cheap drama ! rest in peace x-files series ...		4		0
` the mouse that roared ' is a likable but lifeless comedy that has little going for it besides peter sellers 's triplicate performance and a promising premise : a tiny country wages war on america , intending to lose and pocket the compensatory millions to prevent imminent bankruptcy . although the invasion - by a few men armed with bows and arrows - is pretty funny , most of the film is watery , rather subdued , and outstays its welcome even at a mere 80 minutes . the bizarre sequel ` the mouse on the moon ' is a lot better . prime minister ron moody borrows a million bucks from america under the pretext of launching a space rocket when he actually wants it to install indoor plumbing ! moody is excellent , as is bernard cribbins , and they almost make up for the pace , which moves along at roughly the speed of evolution .		4		0
well , this is unexpected . supposedly based on a comic book , priest combined basically a creature feature with western , post-apocalyptic movie , and religious film . this is all an interesting concept , however it never really amounts to much . plot : for years , humanity and `` vampires '' have been at war , resulting in the devastation of most of the planet . the vampires were defeated thanks to a special elite group known as the priests . while humanity now remains in isolated areas , the few remaining vampires are locked up in special facilities -lrb- a formula for disaster -rrb- . when an innocent girl is kidnapped , her father , a priest , sets out to find her and stop a plot the vampires made up to rise again . now first off , the creatures here are suppose to be vampires . they look more like mutant naked mole rats . i admit they actually look pretty cool and they 're sure to freak you out a few times . not to mention , these things live in `` hives '' , they have `` guards '' , and they 're lead by a `` queen '' , just like termites . why call them vampires ?! they do n't bear any resemblance to actual vampires ; they might as well be some totally different creature . and another thing , why keep the remaining vampires alive after the war ? it absolutely makes no sense because keeping the creatures alive guarantees that they will kill us all in the future . that is a serious hole in the plot . who writes all this ?!! as for everything else , it 's pretty much hit-and-miss , mainly miss . the story is somewhat uninspired and has an uneven flow to it . certain scenes seem rushed , misplaced , or sporadic and that takes away some points for me . most of the main characters , including the protagonist , are relatively bland and have little to no interesting traits about them . the dialog between these characters is not written well and it seems that the filmmakers could n't think of how to set the dialog scenes in a proper order . if there 's one aspect i absolutely hate in movies , especially this one , it 's the religious leaders . here they just deny any vampire attack despite seeing the evidence in the end and accuse our poor priest of being a deserter and a fake . i personally have nothing against religion , but fanatics who take it too far really annoy the hell out of me . the only good things here are the `` vampires '' , the action , and the main villain . everything else is crap . it 's not recommended that you see this flick , otherwise it would suck the time of your life out of you like the parasite it is . if you do wind up watching this movie , go to a confessional because this film is a sin .		4		0
the result is pretty annoying as someone got the idea to combine a teen movie and a mystery . but the movie was made in 2006 ! thus , it is strange that showing muscular male torsos , smooth female legs , kisses in the rain / during lightning , nervous relationships , college competition etc , on the one hand , and flying in the air , insects in bodies and in dreams , aged youth , flashing eyes etc , on the other hand , could create a good entertainment . the scenes are stupid at times and no actor is interesting to watch , it seems they were picked thanks to their model-like appearance . renny harlin has made stuff of different quality , but this could have been avoided . additional points from me due to shortness - 1,5 h was not too painful : -rrb-		4		0
the weinstein brothers strike again by bringing french director michael hazanavicius ' silent film tribute , ` the artist ' , to the united states , now in the running for possible oscar gold . to my recollection , silent films wore out their welcome way back in 1927 , and only something strikingly original , should be considered for the academy 's highest honor . while hazanavicius does his best at technically putting together the kind of film they made in the silent era -lrb- and he certainly does n't get ` everything ' right -rrb- , story wise , his narrative is completely derivative . there 's nary a single original idea in the entire picture . hazanavicius ' protagonist is george valentin , obviously named after silent screen legend himself , rudolph valentino . valentin 's character , a heartthrob before the advent of the talkies , is modeled historically more on silent screen star , john gilbert , than valentino . after the introduction of the talkies , gilbert 's career fell apart , not because the sound of his voice did n't sit well with audiences now accustomed to ` talking pictures ' , but because he was saddled with inferior scripts and the one or two good pictures he was in , did not find wide favor with the public . like valentin in ` the artist ' , gilbert also proceeded to self-destruct by embracing the bottle . the artist 's narrative is based both on films from the silent era as well some classic sound pictures . ` the count of monte cristo ' , one of gilbert 's well-known silent era films as well as douglas fairbanks ' ` the three musketeers '' are alluded to when valentin is seen in one of the ` pictures within a picture ' , playing an action hero swordsman . silent era melodrama is also referenced when valentin 's dog , jack , alerts a policeman on the beat , who runs into the fading screen star 's home , and saves him from a raging fire . i ca n't help being reminded of the early sound serial , ` the little rascals ' , where dogs are used to a more comic effect . early in ` the artist ' , jack is featured in an amusing bit , running to and fro , on stage . while there are many allusions to actual silent films and very early talkies in ` the artist ' , the basic plot is derived from two later classic ` sound ' films . in ` the artist ' , valentin , a once successful actor , now in sad decline after a successful career , finds himself supplanted by a love interest , who has gone on to a successful career of her own as a celebrity actor , but offers to rescue him out of both feelings of love and guilt . this in essence is the story of ' a star is born ' , made in the 30s and later revived in the 50s , as a judy garland vehicle . one also can not ignore the parallels to ` sunset boulevard ' , which features a story that in part revolves around the movie studio system . ` the artist ' even has its own chauffeur , clifton , played by james cromwell , that echos the chauffeur role in ` sunset boulevard ' , famously played by erich von stroheim . should i also mention how mr. hazanavicius ca n't help himself throw in a bit from ` citizen kane ' ? when valentin uncovers all his auctioned effects which peppy had purchased for him , it 's a scene completely reminiscent from ` citizen kane ' , where all of kane 's property sits in storage , covered by similar white cloths . and what of hazanavicius ' lazy use of music composed by bernard hermann , associated with both orson welles and hitchcock ? it seems that ludovic bource simply ran out of ideas and perhaps was unable to complete the score . a more likely scenario is that hazanavicius simply wanted to save money by licensing hermann 's hitchcock soundtrack . there is little point in rehashing the details of hazanvicius ' derivative and pointless plot . suffice it to say , it 's valentin who ironically discovers kindly peppy martin , after she accidentally crashes through a roped off area of valentin groupies , and is photographed by paparazzi . after sad sack valentin feels sorry for himself after falling from grace as a silent screen star and peppy becomes famous in the talkies , he takes to the bottle and is about to kill himself . leave it to jack to save him along with peppy , who recalls that valentin is actually a talented dancer , and suggests to the kinograph studio honcho , that they could make a great pair , as the next rogers and dance team . if ` the artist ' has any value , is in its fairly faithful recreation of a bygone era . it 's fun watching how director hazanavicius utilizes the costumes , makeup and set design , as well as the many techniques of silent film era cinematography to create the final product , which best can be described as a ` loving tribute ' . nonetheless , hazanavicius has chosen merely to emulate the traditional conventions of the silent film era than create an original , final product . one is reminded more of a ` b ' melodrama from that era than one of the classics , such as the kind proffered up by a chaplin or keaton . it 's a sad state of affairs when a less than mediocre story , created in a now defunct style of filmmaking -lrb- which was put to rest over seventy years ago -rrb- , garners some of the top awards from the chief pundits in today 's film industry . it only goes to show how hard up the film industry is , in its ability to discover and promote quality scripts , instead resorting to the dubious tactic of reaching back to yesteryear , for ill-advised inspiration .		4		0
i just wonder if the indestructible man was somewhat of a different movie at one time or another . this movie seems far too muddled in unnecessary voice-overs and the fact that chaney does n't speak for the majority of the movie -lrb- because of course the drug that made him the indestructible man affected his vocal cords , but strangely , nothing else -rrb- . karloff does n't really make a convincing villain because he 's going , uh , rather slow and not necessarily menacing , lumbering from one victim to the next , of course , everyone else thinks he 's terrifying , what with his quivering eyes and what not . this tries to mix the film noir with the monster movie , and fails somewhat because it seems to have too much film noir and not enough monster , in the literal sense .		4		0
this is a most film , having won the cannes palm d'or and the golden globes . i was attracted by its stark black-and-white photography seen in its previews and clips . i had to watch it . this film starts off well enough , feeling like a , as it relates the strange series of accidents and deaths in a small rural town in pre-wwi germany . however , as it lumbers on , we get the feeling that this is going absolutely nowhere . it seems to be just a jumble of weird , even evil , events that involved the children of this town . this is definitely unsettling , unnerving and very difficult to watch and follow . it was like a throwback to very old european films . indeed it did not feel like a contemporary film at all . the acting was wooden . the editing was choppy . scenes do not seem to lead logically to the next . i would understand leaving the ending open for the audience 's interpretation . however , this film had crammed too many inexplicable and unrealistic occurrences that demand a resolution . to be left hanging at the end is quite a distressing disappointment after investing over two hours .		4		0
well known for the unfortunate notoriety from the murder of its actress adrienne shelly mere months before its debut , waitress was something i 'd encountered before but skipped on , assuming it not quite aimed at the likes of me . drawn in by the magnetic pull of irresistible fillion , however , i eventually acquiesced . stuck in a marriage with her possessive and jealous husband earl , jenna desperately seeks the money she needs to escape her small-town existence and establish her own pie diner . discovering she is pregnant , she reluctantly falls into a relationship with her gynecologist dr pomatter . a devout disciple of firefly and serenity , i regard myself as something of a fillion completist , the irresistible charm and humour of the man preventing me from staying away from even the sappiest sounding things to which he aligns himself -lrb- i 've yet to sink to the level of desperate housewives , mind -rrb- . but ! this is a not a fillion film , so we shall have to stop treating it as such , sha n't we ? the film 's primary character , jenna , is well portrayed , her situation a sympathetic one . jeremy sisto is typically mad as her suspicious husband , an excellent supporting role . however , i do n't buy for a second that theirs is the kind of relationship from which she could n't simply walk away . earl appears not in the slightest abusive , either physically or sexually , and has the mental faculty of a child . this is not a character than i can imagine holding any sort of sway over a character as strong as jenna . the film relies on our belief in the tragedy of her circumstance , yet it is more cartoonish than anything else , the vaguely sketched conflicts within the marriage never approaching the realism of an abusive relationship . furthermore , the bright colour scheme of the film retains an optimism which seems to clash with the mood shelly is attempting to create . though she deals in dark themes , not least of all adultery , the film has the feeling of a glossy rom-com in which the most problematic of troubles are infinitesimal in comparison to that of real life . the film exists in a fairy-tale world , so far removed from reality that it is quite irksome . the humour feels as though it is trying too hard to be kooky and quirky , only serving to add to this disappointing fantasy sheen which prevents the narrative ever realising its potential . elements of the plot are quite unoriginal and predictable , particularly that of wealthy and curmudgeonly cum customer joe , the progress of which everyone ought to see from a mile away . though it is massively flawed , the film has a certain charm , articulated particularly by fillion -lrb- call me biased , i 'm right though -rrb- . it may be unrealistic and a of serious topics , but its comedy has some merit , the scenes in the doctor 's office around the articulation of the illicit relationship particularly well constructed . these are the only scenes of the film that truly work , and one laments the fact that they are not more in number . dragged down by its many flaws , waitress glosses in a saccharine way over the real problems its themes should address . there are a decent number of laughs to be had here , though mostly only whilst nathan fillion or jeremy sisto are on-screen . too kooky , colourful , and rom-com oriented for its own good , it 's formulaic , but a bit of fun .		4		0
the rite typically , the job of a catholic priest 's assistant is to keep an eye out while the father showers with the alter boys . thankfully , the duty of the deputy in this horror movie is a lot less devilish . after receiving a complimentary degree from a seminary , michael -lrb- colin o'donoghue -rrb- foregoes entering the priesthood due to skepticism . in lieu of reimbursement of the tuition , father matthew -lrb- toby jones -rrb- suggests he study exorcism abroad . fascinated by demonic possession , when in rome , michael aligns himself with renowned exorcist father luca -lrb- anthony hopkins -rrb- , who the doubting thomas in the ways of the wicked . but when a malevolent spirit enters his teacher , michael 's fluctuating faith must be steadfast . by treading no new terrain in terms of storyline or gore , the rite is an exercise in exorcism that plods along at a lackadaisical pace . besides , nothing is more ironic , or hilarious , than a demonically possessed priest . -lrb- red light -rrb-		4		0
tom cruise ca n't act anymore . he always knew how to smile and he still knows that , but he ca n't live on that ability . not even in a film like this . this is a so called action-comedy . since long , all discussions about censoring film violence is strictly forbidden , but if you still honour the rebel banner , you can of course say that killing about a 100 people with hardly any blood seen at all , can make some real damage to the audiences morals . violence is neither fun nor clean . cameron diaz is making one of her better performances here and she 's the only one who tries to act like a comedian . but the only must about this film is that you really must n't see it . too little good action , too little good comedy .		4		0
`` white chicks '' , a film done by the wayans brothers , is an example of the kind of the crude , immature comedies that are common nowadays , but it 's not a very good example . i saw a good chunk of this film a couple years ago , and i guess i thought it was so-so . i finally watched the whole thing very recently , and unsurprisingly , it did n't quite do it for me . some are irked by stupid comedies like this in general , but i think they can be really funny . however , while i ca n't say i managed to keep a straight face the entire time -lrb- i smiled a bit -rrb- , i did manage to do so for the most part , and it was often too stupid even for me ! kevin and marcus copeland are two fbi agents who are on a mission to catch drug dealers . unfortunately , they do not succeed in this mission , as they end up attacking an innocent ice cream deliverer , instead . after this , the two agents are in disgrace , and are very close to being fired , but soon , they have another assignment . this time , they are to protect brittany and tiffany wilson , two spoiled heiresses , from a kidnapping threat . while driving these two heiresses , they end up in an accident , leaving brittany and tiffany with marks on their faces , making them feel that they do n't look presentable . the wilson sisters will not show up at the society weekend with these marks on their faces , so kevin and marcus decide to go instead , disguised as the two spoiled heiresses ! will this mission save their careers as fbi agents , or will it ruin them ?! this wayans brothers comedy is filled with toilet humour , a type of humour that some ca n't stand , but also a popular type . i 'm sure you can tell by some of my previous reviews that i do n't have a problem with toilet humour in general . however , in some cases , i find that it can be too much , and `` white chicks '' is an example of that . as you can probably tell by the title , the movie is also very politically incorrect , with some racist and sexist jokes , but the wayans brothers are n't the only ones currently in the comedy business to do this , and many are n't bothered by these types of jokes , as long as they do n't take them seriously . i think i 've made it clear that the main problem i have with this movie is that it 's simply not very funny . parts that made me smile include marcus falling asleep while his wife is talking to him , and kevin and marcus responding angrily in their normal voices to guys flirting with them , after they had just put their disguises on for the first time and were not yet used to it . however , there are also several scenes that i thought were embarrassing -lrb- or close to it -rrb- , such as one of the undercover agents in the ladies room , having a very loud bowel movement , while friends of the wilson sisters are also in the washroom , and the and farting in the restaurant . i understand that the wayans brothers were behind `` scary movie '' , a spoof movie which i think is quite bad . i personally did n't find `` white chicks '' as bad as that , but fairly close , i think . after watching it , i do not intend to ever watch `` little man '' , another film from the wayans ' , which is apparently worse , just like i would n't have ever watched the dreadful `` epic movie '' -lrb- a spoof done by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer , two others who were behind `` scary movie '' -rrb- if i saw `` scary movie '' first , and after seeing both of those films , i wo n't be watching any of the sm sequels or `` date movie '' . `` white chicks '' is , in part , satire of paris hilton , or both of the hilton sisters . i like this concept , but sadly , the potential that the film may have had was n't reached .		4		0
one of those `` there 's something hidden in the dark '' kind of horror flicks -lrb- . . like boogeyman ; 2005 -rrb- , certainly not a choice for those with . the film never fully spells out what `` they '' are so we must accept that the `` night terrors '' that plague our traumatized victims suffering sleep deprivation , are creatures from another type of returning to collect those `` marked '' as children . director robert harmon -lrb- the hitcher ; 1986 -rrb- never gives us an entire look of the creature . . just a silhouette of something in the distance moving around , barely recognizable , but just visible enough to allow you an idea that it is present and dangerous . harmon establishes that what you do not see can be far more scary , or at least that seems to be his goal . . whether it works or not depends on the viewer , if you are gripped by what has beset the poor young adults . the film primarily focuses on julia lund -lrb- laura regan ; my little eye -rrb- , a psyche major , working on her thesis , whose phobia of the dark -lrb- . . night terrors -rrb- are reawakened after a friend from childhood blows his brains out right in front of her . soon , laura meets others who have similar problems with `` those who hide in the dark '' , sam -lrb- ethan embry -rrb- & terry -lrb- dagmara dominczyk -rrb- . we watch as this trio succumb to those hunting them because you can only run so long from the dark . ambiguous and extremely grim conclusion left me rather torn . . in a way , i applaud not always letting our lead off the hook in a daring decision by the filmmakers , yet i would 've liked to have understood why the creatures ever returned the kids to start with . and , if they were afraid of the light , how could they cause power to go off ? and , what 's the reason behind waiting until the characters reached 25 ? the level of uncertainty in the psychology of the creatures themselves makes so little sense , i 'm kind of bewildered at what causes them to act the way they do . maybe , that 's beside the point altogether . . it 's not about why they come after these characters it 's about their pursuit period . most will overlook the details , focus on the monsters themselves , and watch in horror as the characters attempt futilely to escape to no avail . marc blucas is paul , julia 's paramedic boyfriend who worries about her worsening mental state . jay is julia 's old psychiatrist , dr. booth , attempting to help her snap out of what he considers an emotional crisis due to her friend 's suicide , and how she could n't rescue him from such a decision . another one of those flicks boasting credits featuring wes craven 's name -lrb- . . which was a hot commodity at the time -rrb- .		4		0
everyone seems to agree that hook was one of steven spielberg 's great disappointments . it was a reasonable hit after the financial failure of always , but it was unanimously critically savaged . even now , 16 years later , and unlike some of spielberg 's less regarded films , people 's opinions of it remain unchanged . when spielberg has his eye on the ball , he can be a fantastic filmmaker . duel and jaws were gruelling experiences that left one physically and mentally drained . terrific entertainment ! and when spielberg concentrates on more sentimental stories , they can be incredibly tender like schindler 's list and ai . but if he indulges child-like sentiment too much , he turns out overrated mush like et . and hook . hook is more flawed than any other spielberg film . yes it does ask the intriguing question , what if peter pan grew up ? but the way the film answers it simply does n't work . there 's a clumsiness to its storytelling , and bar a few genuinely exhilarating moments here and there , much of spielberg 's usual magic is sadly absent . the grown up peter pan , now peter banning , and played by robin williams is a ruthless corporate raider . in a bizarre twist , peter has become a modern day pirate . he has little time for his wife moira , and even less time for his children jack and maggie . when he visits london for christmas , wendy -lrb- maggie smith -rrb- is not the young lady she once was . and she 's devastated to learn peter 's not what he used to be either . all the child like innocence and youthful exuberance he once had have all but vanished over the years . but he must get it back . because captain hook -lrb- dustin hoffman -rrb- has just kidnapped jack and maggie , and with the aid of tinkerbell -lrb- julia roberts -rrb- and the lost boys , peter must rediscover his long forgotten past , and become peter pan once more . i think the reason why hook is such an abject failure is because spielberg 's need for mawkish sentiment really goes into overdrive here . there are all the usual spielberg trademarks . the inattentive father . carefully calculated emotional cues . and most importantly , the idea of the fantastical coming into contact with the ordinary . but really , nothing comes off . i was so disappointed with the film . robin williams is certainly impish enough . but he only falls into the usual woolly headed sludge that would become his trademark in the 90s . hook was just for starters . dustin hoffman is much too pantomimic and theatrical as captain hook . he adopts a perfect etonian accent , and looks every inch the character , but never elevates it to threatening status . even if he looks like he 's having the most fun . julia roberts is horribly miscast as tinkerbell . the disney version had more screen appeal and she never even had to say a word . the miniaturised roberts struts around the set with giant size fairy wings on her back not doing much of anything else . and her american accent quickly grates . at least bob hoskins makes for an entertaining smee . his scenes with hoffman are fun , so i suppose the film is n't a total waste . roger ebert thought the lost boys looked like they 'd walked off the set of oliver ! , and as i was watching the film , i was thinking the same thing . spielberg is usually reliable for getting good performances out of children , but this time there are just too many to take into account . they 're skateboarding -lrb- ! -rrb- and are frankly just boring . and i thought the film wasted maggie smith . such a fantastic actress as her should not be shelved aside . the idea of an elderly wendy is a fascinating one , but it does n't even try to explore it . hook sadly one of hollywood 's greatest unsung actresses . but the biggest disappointment of all is never-never land itself . i was expecting an extraordinary fantastical wonderland . what we get instead is a curiously stagebound setting . neverland looks exactly like the set that it is . and the special effects are well below the high standards of spielberg . obvious . flat surroundings . spielberg must really have been having an off-day when he made hook . there are a few moments that show some of spielberg 's magical touch . i loved the scene when peter rediscovers himself as peter pan . its quite well written and ends in a haunting epiphany . its just a shame that it takes so long building up to it . still , the scenes of peter soaring through the sky are wonderful , and makes your heart truly sing . its the one genuine triumphal act of the entire film . but the rest of the film seldom flies as high . hook is too juvenile for its own good , and the journey from peter banning to peter pan is much too long . even the climax feels too wound up to make any kind of impact . an utter disappointment . spielberg 's worst film of the 90s .		4		0
this movie is really a treat for the eyes , and maybe all the flash and bang helps you ignore the huge plot flaws . long and short - you have this galactic republic where the government kind of ceases to work due to all the bureaucracy . on one side , you have separatists who want out of the republic , but few of them want to fight to do it , so they build millions of robots . the systems that want to stay in the republic are n't all that keen to do the fighting , either , so they need an army of clones to do their dirty work , lead by jedi who are n't all that interested in what the fight is about . they are busy looking for a whole two sith dudes , one hiding right under their noses . oh , wait , this has a love story . that you do n't buy for a minute . honestly , i was kind of creeped out by anakin , and i could n't imagine his pining for fascism or genocide was a real turn on for padme ... give me the original trilogy , which at least felt a need to develop character and story , and not see them as a place to hand special effects . the underlying flaw of prequels is that the character 's backstory is best left to the imagination . darth vader was vastly more interesting in the way he was remembered in the earlier films . when you actually show him as a petulant teen with hormone issues , he becomes a lot less interesting .		4		0
this film goes into the category of `` chick-flick '' but there are some `` chick-flicks '' that are very well made . unfortunately , this is not one of those . story starts out with 4 girls in the woods about 50 years ago who invent a club just for them called . . oh , you know . well , forward ahead to modern day and we see sidda walker -lrb- sandra bullock -rrb- who is a successful playwright and she gives an interview to time magazine and says her childhood was difficult . the article comes out and sidda 's mother vivi -lrb- ellen burstyn -rrb- reads it and is furious and writes her out of her will and tears up her photo 's and acts very melodramatic . the rest of the `` ya-ya 's '' are teensy -lrb- fionnula flanagan -rrb- , -lrb- shirley knight -rrb- and caro -lrb- maggie smith -rrb- and they travel to where sidda lives and spike her drink and somehow get her back to louisiana but do n't tell vivi that they have her . well , she finds out from sidda 's fiance ' conner -lrb- angus macfadyen -rrb- that they have her but she is not allowed to see her . while at their place sidda looks at their old scrapbook and then the film uses flashbacks to view several events including why vivi was a difficult mother and her bout with depression and being hooked on pills . this film is the directorial debut of writer callie khouri who wrote the screenplay for `` thelma and louise '' and she displays tremendous patience in her storytelling and the film goes on way to long . the characters all play southern belles and there are times during the film that it is difficult to understand exactly what they are saying . smith is an english actress and her southern accent is just not believable . as i watched this film i kept waiting for the big scene that is suppose to tell us about vivi but it never really comes because we already know in advance about her troubles and yet the film is still a solid two hours long . james garner plays shep and the actor that plays him as a young man appears to be a good foot taller then he is . i did n't hate this film because with a great cast like this it would be impossible . the most effective scenes in the film come from ashley judd who is suppose to be a young vivi and although i 'm not convinced of how good of an actress she is , she is good in this film . this film could have benefited from more editing and more realistic dialogue . great cast tries hard but except from a few scattered moments this is a big disappointment . `` ya-ya '' !		4		0
i did n't like this movie at all , i did see rec few days before seeing this movie and i loved rec , it was scary and it had a lot of action in the movie . jason creed and a small crew of college filmmakers are in the pennsylvania woods making a no-budget horror film when they hear the terrifying news that the dead have started returning to documents the true-life horrors in a tense , first-person style that heightens the reality of each encounter . even as his friends die , even as they are attacked by ravenous walking corpses at every stop the plot sound really good but it just did n't work , i find the movie really boring , i did not find it scary or gory at all , zombie were not scary at all and there make up effect looked really bad . i was bored with this movie , i had to fast forward some of scenes and the acting did n't help the movie all , i could not care less about any of those people . if you want to document zombie movie go and see rec and forget about this movie . 4/10		4		0
never mess with someone who can drop you with his gun from miles away . snipers somehow has this aura of mystique and sexiness associated with the motto of `` one shot , one kill '' , as exhibited in movies like enemy at the gates , or memorable war characters such as in saving private ryan . in shooter , this gets demystified for a while , hitting home that not only should one be gifted with the pulling of the trigger from incredible distance , a sniper is also a master mathematician , having to compute the trajectory of the round with factors of humidity , wind direction , angle etc just to hit the target . mark wahlberg stars as bob lee swagger , whom director antoine fuqua makes him literally walk with a swagger in all the silhouetted slow motion shots . a battle hardened veteran with ghosts from the past -lrb- do n't they all -rrb- , he gets tempted back to assist the authorities in order to feed his patriotic adrenaline , only to find himself screwed and framed for a treasonous crime he did not commit . it 's cat and mouse as prey becomes hunter , and tries to exact justice and at the same time , to try and prove his innocence . expect the usual guns , explosions , and plenty of blood and gore . shooter plays off like an urban rambo meeting the fugitive , only this time dr richard kimble has biceps the size of melons and fights back with deadly accuracy from his rifle . he runs from the authorities , firmly put as the scheming villains involved in shady deals and the existence of a covert group of greed ala x-files , one of whom is played by danny glover , in a rare turn of alignment to the dark side . no self-respecting beefcake wannabe can do without some diy operation scene to keep alive , or some montage in gathering and making new weapons -lrb- pipe bombs , napalm anyone ? -rrb- , and half the time i was wondering about mark wahlberg being the quintessential new generation action hero . gone are the days when hollywood action movie were ruled by the - vandamme trio , and surprisingly there are no permanent beefcakes who can readily step into and fill the void . wahlberg has been slowly inching his way in my opinion , though marky mark 's filmography of the italian job , the planet of the apes remake , the perfect storm and the more recent four brothers , do suggest that more should be done to cement this status , hence shooter . i ca n't wait for his brazilian job to hit the screens , though that one plays more like an ocean 's eleven rather than the individual action hero type . the departed was a vulgar bit role , so that does n't count . antoine fuqua is no stranger to directing action movies , or movies with the hero caught up against unfair odds . from training day to tears of the sun , you can see earlier influences creep their way into shooter , making it a little familiar territory visited . there are many sweeping shots used to try and the movie , and set action sequences take priority , reducing character development to the token time available between scenes , and sometimes at the expense of plausibility . the supporting cast was fun to watch , as michael pena -lrb- world trade center , crash -rrb- almost stole the show with his rookie fbi character being caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time , and almost against his training , wishes and protocol , forms and becomes an important ally for wahlberg 's swagger . the woman folk however get relegated to backseat roles , as per the usual fuqua movies with eva mendes , keira knightley and monica belluci . do n't expect kate mara or rhona mitra to do much . as for the rest , they are your token cardboard characters , there to chew the scene . shooter is an action fan 's fodder , and it is nothing more than a guilt trip watching a cowboy of a hero mopping up the town 's scum , exactly in the way we like to see justice served - without remorse , exacting , and served extremely cold . a satisfying actioner with the usual thrills and spills .		8		1
for whatever reason , i have probably seen clue more times than any movie ever made . i would guess that i 've watched it more than 100 times . and i never get tired of it . obviously , i feel that it holds up rather well through repeat viewings . it 's witty and clever . some of the scenes and dialogue are laugh-out-loud funny . there are far too many moments that stand out in my mind to narrow it down to one favorite , but i 'll include this one as an example : - mrs. white : he was deranged , he was ... lunatic . he did n't seem to like me very much . he had threatened to kill me in public . - miss scarlet : why would he want to kill you in public ? - wadsworth : i think she meant he threatened , in public , to kill her . the characters may lack depth and dimension , but all are very well played by a talented ensemble cast . i 've read any number of complaints about perceived plot holes , but who cares ? if you 're so busy noticing each time a candlestick changes places in a scene or who 's holding what weapon , i think you 're missing the point . none of it is to be taken seriously and can not be analyzed as such . i look at these plot holes as part of the plot . they make it all the more fun .		8		1
hard candy takes an idea that has become the subject of a million warnings since the introduction of the internet , and turns it on its head . the film is extremely brave in the way that the subject matter is handled , and it constantly tackles unpleasant themes head on . i really do n't associate this type of film with modern cinema , and so hard candy deserves high praise for daring to go where so many films these days dare not . unfortunately , the story does n't quite come together as well as it could have done , but it is difficult to juggle so many themes and what we do have here is a tense and traumatic film that brilliantly gets the audience into the heads of both of the main characters . the film begins by showing an internet conversation in which two people - a teenage girl and an older man - agree to meet in a café . the girl comes on strong , and she ends up inviting herself back to the man 's apartment after he tells her that he has an mp3 from a goldfrapp concert . however , the girl has an ulterior motive , and pretty soon their traditional roles are reversed as she takes control of the situation . the way that director david slade builds tension is extremely impressive , and the central set-piece is likely to result in a lot of chewed fingernails and ground down teeth in audience members . the focus on the characters and their actions become rather skewed during this period and i actually found myself feeling sorry for the paedophile . this may well be the point of the film , however ; as several things are left wide open , leaving the audience members to make their mind up about which actions are right , and hard candy definitely succeeds in making its audience members think . of course , it would be practically impossible for the director to put a slant on the film that would completely satisfy everyone , but what we do have here is a film that makes a point in a way that is a lot more poignant than many more critically acclaimed films . as a thriller , the film works extremely well also ; as mentioned , hard candy is extremely gripping at its best moments , and i do n't think i 've completely ` gotten into ' a modern film this much for some time . i ca n't say this film is for everyone ; but hard candy is very nearly a complete success , and i recommend everyone at least give it a go .		8		1
will smith 's pursuit of an oscar might be accomplished for his stellar & heartbreaking work in the sappy , but then again feel-good , flick `` the pursuit of happiness '' . the film chronicles the true story of chris gardner , an medical equipment salesman in the 70 's who eventually becomes homeless and has to solely care for his young son christopher . however , this constant persevering gardner obtains an unpaid internship at a dean witter brokerage firm in his pursuit of his happy dream job as a stockbroker . the film 's focus on the kinship between father & son through turbulent times was conducted with the right heartstrings . kudos goes out to screenwriter steve conrad for playing the right heartstring tunes . will 's real son jaden smith plays kid christopher . mr. & mr. smith pull it off to proclaim their work as the best father & son acting duo performance in cinema history . `` the pursuit of happiness '' did get off the `` film happy route '' with a few irrelevant scenes . however , this endearing narrative is one worth smiling about ! so `` c'mon get happy '' and pursue yourself to view `` the pursuit of happiness '' . **** good		8		1
but that man is busy so the french send inspector . well actually the plot has the famous diamond stolen once again and the country where the diamond is from insists on the inspector to be the one on the case which of course once again starts the chief inspector down a long road of painful incidents and bad mental health . the movie is a very funny entry to the series as are all the movies that actually have peter sellers in the movie and not as simple stock and leftover footage . this one though is not quite as good as say revenge or shot for me mainly because the movie at times focuses on the phantom who is seemingly framed for the theft of said pink panther diamond . these scenes at times seem more fitting for a james bond movie rather than a movie in the pink panther set . however , for the most part we have the focus of the flick on as he is led around following a decoy so the phantom can figure the real culprit . this of course takes him to a couple of places all the while driving chief inspector literally nuts .		8		1
to live and die in la -lrb- 4 outta 5 stars -rrb- it 's been a long time since i had seen this movie ... when i first saw it the actors were all basically unknown to me ... now they are all fairly well-known -lrb- william l peterson , willem dafoe , john pankow -rrb- ... but , wow , this is was a great movie then and it 's a great movie now . a great film to director william friedkin 's `` the french connection '' ... but taking place on the other side of the us . terrific story about the us secret service and the counterfeiting racket ... do n't want to give away too many details because the best part of the movie is its unpredictability . suffice to say that the movie has one of the greatest , jaw-droppingly exciting chase scenes ever filmed ... i 'd say it even tops the one in `` french connection '' ! the movie has a large cast of characters ... all of them memorable and believable and all integrated well into the basic storyline . some of the '80s music sounds a little cheesy -lrb- wang chung did the soundtrack -rrb- but some of it actually works pretty well . do n't miss this one !		8		1
what more can be said about a movie that 's become a perennial christmas favorite featuring a whole slew of irving berlin song and dance routines , and two of the most popular and talented stars of film musicals -- bing crosby and fred astaire at their best . well , it 's a light , airy , briskly entertaining sort of musical that deserves its immense popularity due mainly to the unforgettable berlin songs that are sprinkled throughout : `` white christmas '' , `` easter parade '' , `` happy holidays '' and `` be careful , it 's my heart '' , among a roster of other delights that more than make up for a thin storyline . and fred astaire , in his prime , is a dancer to be reckoned with when he taps his way through the perfectly timed firecracker dance for the fourth of july sequence . that amazing solo dance , thanks to a pocketful of firecrackers , is alone worth waiting for . wartime audiences back in 1942 hungered for this kind of innocent fun and laughter -- as well as all of the nostalgic , cozy sort of charm induced by having an inviting setting -lrb- a lovely old farmhouse in connecticut -rrb- serve as the focal piece for the story of two show business men fighting over the same girl . marjorie reynolds lends her winsome charm to the female lead and walter abel is delightful in a good supporting role . especially interesting is the way the storyline leads to hollywood and the movie combines the christmas stage setting on a studio set -lrb- which is supposed to be an exact replica of the farmhouse -rrb- , as compared to the real thing . and it 's there , on that studio set , that the story leads to its inevitable conclusion with the singing of `` white christmas '' . interesting bit of trivia : my personal favorite best song nomination that year was `` love is a song '' , the beautiful main theme of bambi , but , of course , it had no chance against irving berlin 's title tune at the top of all the music charts . too bad paramount could n't afford technicolor for this one . they were on a budget during the war years and made very few major releases in color .		8		1
bee movie is a good movie although nothing spectacular . it has a very complex humor not everyone would understand , the kind of comedy jerry seinfeld does , very sarcastic . the story about a recent graduated bee called barry b. benson , who wants more of life than just working in the hive for the rest of his life is quite original and interesting . it is brilliantly written by seinfeld . the animation is n't something out of this world but still very well made . the music selection is quite interesting . the cast of voices is excellent . jerry seinfeld is great as barry its like watching him in the shape of a bee , chris rock is wonderful as the mosquito , so hilarious , renee zellweger 's performance as vanessa was n't great but it was good enough , patrick warburton as vanessa 's misunderstood boyfriend is great , matthew broderick as barry 's friend was good and a brief but funny appearance from john goodman as the mean lawyer . definitely this is a movie worthy to watch , enjoyable and entertaining , recommendable for all the family .		8		1
i am not really big on cartoon movies , but my girlfriend is . so i ended up watching this with her and her family . boy , i am sure glad i was included in that event : this film was a true gem . not only is it funny , but it 's fun , and even emotional . i cried twice , and i am not prone to crying . but that 's just how it goes when you have a film like this -- something with both cute little minions and girls who you have to feel a bit sorry for -lrb- although the eldest girl is a bit of a brat -rrb- . gru makes a great villain , and i look forward to seeing him again in the sequel .		8		1
martin scorsese directing a kid 's movie ? you can not be serious . that was the thought that ran through my head when i first read about hugo , based on the children 's book the invention of hugo cabret by brian selznick . while it seemed like an intriguing idea , i was a bit skeptical that a man who has spent almost fifty years in the business directing violent gangster pictures and sweepingly violent period pieces would really be well equipped to direct something that was directed at youngsters . add the fact that it is in 3d , and you have the first real time i had a doubt in scorsese . hugo cabret -lrb- asa butterfield -rrb- lives as an orphan rotating and setting the clocks properly at a train station near paris post 1930s economic depression . he is caught by the local toy store shopkeeper -lrb- played by ben kingsley -rrb- , who confiscates the sketch pad filled with inventions and ideas originally owned by hugo 's father . hugo obviously wants to retrieve it , but there is something deeply troubling the shopkeeper . and with the help of his granddaughter isabelle -lrb- chloë grace moretz -rrb- , the pair set out to find out just what is troubling him . for all the critical praise it has and will continue to receive , it does not negate the fact that hugo is two-thirds of a horrifically boring movie . it starts off interesting enough , but then it slows right down and barely picks itself back up . until the subplots kicked in about the pioneering of the filmmaking medium , i had absolutely no idea where the film was going -- and neither did the film . it just plays itself out without much concern , introducing characters , ideas and elements which may have proved valuable at the time , but are next to useless in the final end game . i found myself frequently questioning just what scorsese was trying to accomplish , and found that the film was more often than not , at odds with itself . it is not a children 's film by a long shot , but it is not necessarily an adult film either . there are moments of adventure and whimsy , but then there are some really dark and disturbing moments as well . it just does not know what it wants to be , and suffers as a result of it . when i am fighting the urge to pass out during one of the most highly anticipated films of the year because i am bored to tears , then there is clearly an issue . while we can blame the lack of any semblance of plot development on the source material -lrb- i have not read selznick 's novel , but it sounds like a mish-mash of ideas that barely come together -rrb- , i feel that scorsese is a talented enough director that he should have been able to see through the problems , and fix them with relative ease . he is out of his element here making his first real `` children 's movie '' , but his craft is just as impeccable as always . surely he could tell that he needed to make his thinly veiled plea for cinematic restoration and preservation a lot sooner and clearer than he does , right ? he clearly has a passion for the material , but the film lacks that electric feel that most scorsese films have . it lacks that jolt , that spark that really transcends the medium , and sets his work apart from everyone else 's . if you had very little knowledge of the project and left hugo before the cinema subplot kicks in , you may not even know the film was part of scorsese 's oeuvre . it may simply look like a very gorgeous film , with some intriguing characters and a total lack of a cohesive story . but for all the story related issues , i must say that the film is very impressive to look at . the sets , the costumes , and the editing style -- all of it is just as incredible as we have come to expect . scorsese knows how to make a really authentic and meticulously designed period piece , and his work here is no different . but what really makes it dazzle and come to life , rather surprisingly , is the 3d . it is generously employed throughout the film very carefully , very rarely coming off as the gimmick it inherently is . instead , it adds depth and a stunning realism to the film . it feels like you are in the movie , experiencing what hugo sees and feels . it may look extremely fake when it hits blu-ray , but there is no questioning how astonishing it looks here . seeing the clocks in action is particularly wonderful , as is the subtle use of snow outside and dust inside . and even though it is used quite frequently , you never grow tired of it . you just sit in your seat , and wait for the next effect scorsese throws at you . acting is strong across the board , from main players like butterfield , moretz , sacha baron cohen and kingsley , to bit players who serve very little purpose like frances de la tour , richard griffiths , christopher lee and emily mortimer , to extended cameos like jude law and ray winstone . everyone is on their a-game , and shines well above the dialogue and actions they are given . particular attention needs to be played to butterfield , who shoulders the majority of the film almost exclusively . his plight is the stuff of wonder and imagination , and would have been simply riveting had the film 's content been a bit better focused . while hugo is a positively stunning experience to view , the majority of the story leaves a lot to be imagined . even with the great acting and wonderful 3d , the film suffers from a horrendous element of boredom constantly . when the third act kicks in , it finally figures out what it wants to be and suddenly the film becomes the masterpiece it should have been all along . i did enjoy hugo , but this is quite simply a good movie that could have been brilliant . 8/10 .		8		1
those monkeys were so scary were n't they ? could you imagine if they had caught up with her and the bicycle ? i shudder to even think about it . i thought the monkeys in ' 2001 ' were bad news , but these monkeys were just plain reprobate . all monkey business aside , there 's not much a person can say about david lean 's ` passage to india ' that has n't already been said . this film has been analyzed backwards and forwards . i attended an art house screening of this film once where the lecturer went on about the film for a whole hour ! definitely the film is an alluring feast for the senses -lrb- most david lean films are -rrb- , and it is impeccably acted and written with an obligatory beautiful film score by veteran maurice jarre . i pretty much like all of david lean 's films . i like his early works like ` oliver twist ' the best . i even like his mediocre stuff like ` dr. zhivago ' and ` ryan 's daughter ' . i feel sort of in between on this film . it 's not ` lawrence of arabia ' , but it 's much better than ` zhivago ' or ` ryan 's daughter ' . i of course never read e.m. forster 's novel -lrb- probably too heady reading -rrb- , but i thought it was a little curious to do a book/film on the subject of india and not believe in an afterlife . strange . there is the scene , however , where peggy ashcroft enters the mosque and meets who tells her she should n't be there when `` no one is around '' . ashcroft then replies '' but god is here '' . later on in the film two of the main characters state that death is final and nothing rises from the dead . go figure . it seems inconsistent , but then again i did n't spend days analyzing the film or lecturing on it for hours like most of it 's fans .		8		1
professor van helsing -lrb- a typically splendid performance by the impeccable peter cushing -rrb- and his eager son leyland -lrb- likable robin stewart -rrb- join forces with a team of expert martial artists in order to do battle in china with a bunch of legendary local bloodsuckers led by none other than count dracula -lrb- essayed with tremendously sinister theatrical flair by john forbes-robertson -rrb- . director roy ward baker relates the gloriously gonzo story at a snappy pace and delivers a handy helping of bloody violence . don houghton 's dotty and imaginative script comes through with a wildly inventive and energetic blend of the horror and martial arts genres . the karate fights are staged with considerable rip-snorting brio ; it 's a total treat to see a surprisingly spry cushing engage in the strenuous action . david chiang brings real charm to his part as the earnest hsi ching . providing tasty eye candy are voluptuous blonde knockout julie ege as wealthy thrill-seeker mrs. vanessa buren and the lovely szu shih as the delicate , yet deadly mei kwei . the crisp widescreen cinematography by roy ford and john wilcox offers several spookily effective shots of zombies rising out of their graves and hopping down the road . james bernard 's dynamic score hits the stirring spot . a complete blast .		8		1
so many professional reviews of this film grudgingly admit they were moved by it , as if it 's a sin to dislike a well-made movie that moves one emotionally , as if it is always a bad thing to appeal to the better emotions , to the heart instead of the head . `` the real index of civilization , '' said novelist de , `` is when people are kinder than they need to be . '' in an age of abrasive political commentators who have forgotten about compromise and genuine understanding , it 's a joy to encounter a film about kindness and concern , a film where a firm but concerned teacher makes a selfless difference in many lives . that 's what this charming and occasionally upsetting film is about , as french legend gerard jugnot portrays a man who brings music and discipline to a group of underprivileged students . yes , it 's an old story , and yes , it still works .		8		1
this is a very strong , powerful movie . i find myself analyzing a lot of stuff after having seen this . its one of those that makes you think differently , and can change your perspective . kevin spacey is very good , and the nudity is a respectable demonstration of the story , and not a flagrant use of the female body to generate revenue . and despite one grotesque image , all together it is quite a significant film . i highly recommend it .		8		1
the film deserved all the commentary it received both pro and con . i was surprised and gratified that a film which deals with tragedy and the tragic attracted this much attention in a country which is dedicated to the patented formula hollywood ending . meet rhoda williams -lrb- brit marling -rrb- she 's got everything , pretty , a brilliant astronomy and on her way to mit . like most teens , she went out to celebrate and drove home drunk . on her way home , distracted by a strange phenomena in the sky , another earth which has come into view , she slams into john burroughs ' -lrb- william mapother -rrb- car which was stopped at a light . john burroughs ' pregnant wife and son are killed in the collision . burroughs goes into a coma . rhoda draws a four year stretch . flash ahead 4 years , rhoda is out of jail and burroughs is out of a coma . returning home to her room which was left as it was when she prepared to go out on the night of the collision , a sullen , morose rhoda dismantles the room and sleeps on the floor . while her parole officer encourages her to return to school , she opts for a job cleaning the local high school so that she can avoid contact with other people . wandering around in a fog , she gives up her flashy clothes and dresses as unattractively as possible , like a bum . she has an important need to apologize to burrows for his loss but ends up cleaning his house . burrows might have remained in the alcohol numbed stupor into which he slid after recovering from the coma but rhoda never cashed his checks . he therefore seeks her out and their relationship blossoms into a love interest . burroughs returns to pursue the music he had laid aside , advising rhoda that right before the tragic accident he had reached a state of contentment . the implication is clear and rhoda uses it to justify her actions to herself by believing she is making mr burrow 's life a bit better every day . even the distant , morose rhoda seems to become more lively . but rhoda 's past catches up with her when her essay wins a seat on the privately funded expedition to the alternate earth . will her path cross over mr burroughs or will they collide once again ? the photography nicely complements the script and imparts that distant or disconnected feeling to which a morose rhoda is subject . the ending has a powerful message on that subject , but see the film and come to your own conclusion .		8		1
it 's time to play the music , it 's time to light the lights ... but where are the muppets ? they 've gone their separate ways , forgotten and abandoned by the world of showbusiness . and now three fans -lrb- jason segal , amy adams and ... walter ... -rrb- must work to bring them together again , before the famous muppet theatre is torn down by an evil oil baron -lrb- chris cooper -rrb- ... one could almost be tempted to argue that anyone who did n't like at least one second of this film is actually a cold blooded reptile with no heart . because `` the muppets '' will drag you into its world of colour and laughter and , above all , optimism and you will willingly be dragged . reminiscent of many of the let 's put on a show movie musicals of the early days of cinema , but , more importantly , of the wonderful television show that first brought the muppets to fame and fortune , this new addition to their movie cannon is a wonderful tribute to the philosophies and teachings of jim henson . certainly segal , one of the writers of the script , is responsible for this achievement . in lesser hands the script could fall into two dangerous territories : pastiche or corniness . thankfully , segal has brilliantly walked the tightrope between the two . more importantly , he and fellow human co-star amy adams are reduced to supporting artists . they recognise that the real stars of this film are kermit , miss piggy et al , and , a few hilarious winning cameos aside , the humans always stay in the background . the muppets do shine so brightly in this film , that , like 's grand entrance , it can be difficult to shield your eyes from them . sadly not all of them get the screen time they deserve - gonzo in particular feels slightly underused , although arguably he was the main character in their last big screen outing , the underrated `` muppets from space '' - but then this gives the opportunity to some of the lesser muppets to enjoy the limelight , in particular the swedish chef who gains one of the film 's biggest laughs by essentially committing mass muppet murder . the music in the film is sublime - in particular the songs by bret mckenzie , one half of flight of the conchords . `` man or muppet '' works brilliantly in particular , both touching and hilarious . but they also find time to fit in some classics - `` rainbow connection '' still sounds as good as it did back in the seventies , and the immortal sounds of `` mah na mah na '' pulse through the end credits . there are times , though rare , where the film becomes a little too gooey in terms of sentimentality , and the ending feels rushed - but then , his is a muppets movie . everything has to become right in the end , and thank fozzie , it does . 8/10		8		1
with its remarkable use of atmospheric tension , good enough performances , cleverly twisted plot & unusual style of filmmaking , the third man is an excellent crime thriller set in the postwar vienna . it 's a tale about a novelist , holly martins , trying to solve the mystery of the third man that was present when the fatal accident of his best friend took place . nicely directed with opening montages & final showdown in the sewers of vienna being the show-stealers , this film is also crisply photographed & finely edited . an immersive thriller with a memorable climax , & an even an bolder final shot defying the typical happy endings , the third man is definitely worth your time .		8		1
it 's tempting to want to dismiss `` rebel without a cause '' just for the role it plays in james dean 's suffocating iconography , but to do so is to miss out on a great performance in a very good film . dean is jim stark , a troubled but troublemaking teen who finds himself in a new town already off to a bad start . the gang at dawson high does n't appreciate his fancy wardrobe or his humor . the gang 's leader , buzz -lrb- corey allen -rrb- deflates a tire on jim 's car with a switchblade as buzz 's girlfriend judy -lrb- natalie wood -rrb- eggs him on . jim wants no trouble , but as his tagalong pal plato -lrb- sal mineo -rrb- tries to warn him , it 's no use . `` it 's hard to make friends with these guys , '' plato says . `` i do n't want to make friends , '' jim answers , looking cool but sounding uncertain . the only lead role dean ever played that did n't get him an oscar nomination , only because he was competing against himself in `` east of eden , '' jim in `` rebel '' is who people think of when they think of dean . properly , too ; he 's riveting and believable here , playing a tough part with casual bemusement and a sensitivity to the moment that one gets only rarely from more seasoned screen performers . one oddity about `` rebel '' is its place in the pantheon of juvenile delinquent films . it does n't play like one . how unusual is it to see a movie where a youth openly resents his parents for not being firmer with him , and walks away from a fight ? there are episodes of violence and danger , but how many other films feature where the principals agree to stop before someone gets hurt ? `` rebel 's '' strongest scene takes place at the griffith observatory , where a wizened lecturer tells these young people they live in a cosmos marked only by `` the shortness of time between our planet 's birth and its demise . '' poor plato is so overcome by existential dread that he cowers under the seats , to be coaxed up by jim in a moment that crystallizes their friendship . it 's a movie about kids finding their way in an institution , but also about people struggling to shape themselves in a larger world that shows no signs of caring . in that way , and in others , too , `` rebel '' rises above the standards of its day . there are some serious script problems . irving schulman and stewart stern get too stuck on the dime-store freud of their time ; that kids ' emotional problems can be pegged on distant parents . a police detective played by edward platt dispenses wisdom with disconcerting ease : i groan when jim confesses after one such analysis `` i bet you see right through me , do n't you ? '' poor natalie has to deliver lines like `` yes ... no ... i do n't know , '' while dean 's most famous line , `` you 're tearing me apart , '' is something better seen than heard . but even amid such clunky moments , the acting is good . wood shifts believably from daddy 's cloying little girl to angry gang moll -lrb- `` are you always at ringside ? '' jim teases her at one early moment -rrb- , while mineo raises the bar in his every scene with his unaffected need for love and attention . dean delivers a powerful central performance , combining recognizable mannerisms with some off-beat line readings worthy of robert mitchum . you have to wonder what the future would have held for him if he only wore a seat belt . nicholas ray does a powerhouse job as director balancing the need for domestic realism with fluid pacing and an operatic quality aided by garishly effective warnercolor and a killer leonard rosenman score . it 's a quintessential 1950s movie , like others here say . the supporting players are dialed in , from a surprisingly conflicted allen to jim backus 's desperately ingratiating father to jim . one reason dean gives such a great performance is because , for so much of the film , he has backus ' flustered pop to play off of . making a point that life matters even if no one cares , `` rebel '' stands as a lasting achievement as well as a memorial to one -lrb- as the movie would argue , of many -rrb- who died too young .		8		1
as i watched the oscars unfolding through the small hours back in february on sky , i was both flabbergasted and then rather irritated at the regularity of `` the academy award goes to ... the artist '' , mainly because i knew of the real talent that was being consequently going away empty-handed . afterwards , finally seeing the artist with friends in a multiplex , we were all a bit underwhelmed by the whole thing . the oscar 's hype had elevated it way and above that was mortally possible and whilst good , it could n't weave its golden magic on us . out of my friends , i 'm the only one who watches silent movies in any shape or form . therefore , that novelty was not going to overwhelm me . we all agreed on three positive things , though . 1 - the undeniable charm , charisma and dash of lead actor jean dujardin . 2 - the story toward the end and 3 - the dog . the dog , each and every time , every scene he 's in were amazing and some really had to have been painstakingly choreographed . as i said , the story picked up about a third way in and after george valentin 's -lrb- dujardin -rrb- fall from fame and his nightmare flashed his situation to us , i could see where this movie was going and it finally ` clicked ' . that the story was going to be similar to the essence of ` singin ' in the rain ' , charting the dilemma that film-makers and actors of the silent era faced , which , of course , hailed the end for many huge stars , such as charlie chaplin . the thrust is - and a clever one - is that here , with the artist , we have a french production , with an actor with a heavy and perhaps difficult to follow accent , who by being `` silent '' , could make a surprise hollywood hit . in every sense , it looks and feels old hollywood , because you ca n't hear it . and that 's what happened to many silent stars , who could n't sing or speak eloquently . with the advent of the microphone , they were immediately assigned to the scrapheap . once we ascertain that valentin needs to find a new way of making a living and understand how the chorus girl he helped out is now a star , the film , for me , opened up and moved on nicely . yes , the production values are impeccable and its relative novelty raise it above the ordinary . as for the academy and their generosity , well , the previous year they lauded the british ` the king 's speech ' , which was different and well made enough for them to take it to their hearts . and , of course and maybe above all , hollywood loves hollywood !		8		1
*** spoilers *** first of the great 1930 's gangster movies that set the standers for the hundreds that followed it over the next 70 years . basically a rag to riches , if that 's the word for it , story about a local hood cesar enrico `` rico '' bandello , edward g. robinson , making it to the top of a big city crime syndicate only to fall from power and back into oblivion , and eventual death . all this more because of his own arrogance and stupidity then that of the police and d.a 's office . starting out in life as a petty hood and stickup man rico decided to make it big by becoming a member of the sam , stanley field , mob as a combination muscle & hit-man . making waves in the crime world by his brutal actions in getting the job done rico is given the honor to rip off the bronze peacock nightclub on new years eve run by 's biggest mob rival little arnie lorch , maurice black . rico get 's his former partner in crime and now song and dance man at the club joe massara , douglas fairbanks jr , to reluctantly get him and his hoods into the place to rob it . inside things go terribly wrong when it turns out that the state crime commissioner alvin mcclure , lenders stevens , was there , with friends , and gets shot and killed by rico during the robbery . with panicking over the fallout of commissioner mcclure 's murder rico is anything but shy about his action and ruthlessness takes over 's mob knowing that the only person who can finger him in is the one person in the world he can trust with his life and freedom his best friend joe massara . going for the `` big boy 's '' , sidney blackman , job as the top mobster in town rico quickly consolidates his power and is about to make his move only to have his best friend , joe massara , stymie his grandiose master plan . joe being the only person rico can trust is a bit hesitant to join him as his second in command of his criminal organization and that drives rico almost out of his bird . having become an entertainer and becoming romantically involved with his dancing partner olga , glenda farrell , has made joe soft in the head weak in the stomach and unwilling to leave olga for a life of crime , with rico & friends . rico coming to joe 's place with his fellow hood otero , george e. stone , to talk some sense into joe and get him to leave olga for him and his crime syndicate . this all leads to a wild shooting , by otero , that leaves joe wounded and olga , who got the eye-witness account from joe , later spilling the beans to the police about rico being responsible for commissioner mcclure murder . it was interesting to see that joe would n't implicate his friend rico in the mcclure murder and at the same time rico did n't have the nerve to shoot joe when he had the chance to . this showed that the two were still very close with each other even though they went , a while ago , their own separate ways . on the run from the police otero ends up getting shot and killed but rico escapes him the most wanted man in america . being on the lamb and living in a skid row flop house rico is goaded into coming out into the open by his nemesis in the movie `` little caesar '' police sgt. flaherty , thomas e. jackson . feeling insulted by flahertys remarks rico stupidly , like flaherty hoped , calls his office threatening to get even with him for putting down the `` big man '' . having rico 's pay phone traced has the police rush over to the flop house within minutes with rico checking out from his .15 a night bed before they could put the cuffs on him . trapped with nowhere to go or hide in an alley rico shoots it out with the perusing police and gets plugged with a hail of lead falling dead in the streets . it 's then when rico utters his famous last words `` mother of mercy , is this the end of rico ? '' . p.s cesar enrico bandello was shot and killed behind a giant poster of his best friend joe massara and his dancing partner olga advertising their latest song and dance act at the grand `` tipsy topsy turvy '' .		8		1
given the really low rating on this website , i just have to use the word `` honestly '' when i say that i honestly enjoyed this movie.i even liked it more than the first.i really do n't know what you were supposed to expect from this movie.if you were expecting a great family movie like `` up '' , then i guess i can see why you were disappointed with the film.but i was n't disappointed.i thought it was funny , cute , entertaining , and pure fun.it 's no masterpiece by any standards , but it is not a bad film in any way.the acting is n't great , but it 's cross also makes a very funny performance this time also have to admit that the cgi for the chipmunks is n't half bad.i 'm just at a loss of words at how underrated this movie is.i 'm sorry for sounding like i 'm repeating myself , but what in the world did you expect from this movie ? were you expecting something so good as if it were from pixar studios ? were you expecting something that paid homage to the so and you ended up hating this film , you really have some serious issues .		8		1
after seeing the very disappointing forth sequel , i was not really looking this one , i was really surprised with sequel as for fifth movie in series and first one to got straight to video . i do understand why it was , it was of a stand alone movie , which was did have any connections to others i found the whole movie very really tense and little bizarre , i really got into movie , i could not wait until happens next . this movie did not focus on the gory kill , like the last two sequels , there was n't gory scenes in this movie , they very limited , it more like first movie , that focused more on the main lead instead of pinhead him self . the plot the really good , some really good twist and turns from start to end , i was really clad how the movie ended . i found this one to be of the creepiest of the series so far , those creature of hell were really , really effect in this movie . the only down side in that main lead , was n't very like able person , so did n't really care for it . second best sequel in the movie , i going to give this movie 8 out of 10 if i liked that , might give 6 a watch , that hellseeker or deader		8		1
a `` found footage '' horror film along the lines of the blair witch project , and the best of its type since blair witch . it may be even a tad better than it , though it certainly shares some of its central problems , mostly in that the characters are n't at all interesting . katie featherston and micah sloat play a couple that has recently moved in together into a large , empty house . lately , they have been experiencing some strange phenomena , like appliances and faucets turning on by themselves and things moving around on their own . they 've also woken to footsteps in the night . katie has had similar experiences several times in her life before , and is , of course , freaked out that they seem to be starting up again after a long lull . micah , on the other hand , is excited and comes home one day -lrb- as the film opens -rrb- with a brand new , super-expensive camera with which he hopes to capture some of the paranormal activity . he sets it up every night in their bedroom and records everything on his laptop . the couple also consults a psychic , who warns against the camera , saying that any attempts to communicate with the possible spirit might make it stronger . sure enough , the occurrences grow more and more prominent . while the film is fairly predictable , it 's great at building tension . its stroke of genius is that , every night , the film returns to that static shot in the bedroom . it never rushes anything as we silently observe the open door to their bedroom and the darkness behind it , knowing that at some point something weird is going to happen . every time it returns to that set-up , we know it 'll get worse , and ultimately i did n't even want to open my eyes when it arrived back at night . the film is smart never to go over the top , always keeping things very small . unfortunately , i think its own smallness is going to kill it when more people wander out to see it . audiences wanting big reveals and in-your-face gore are going to be too dumb to appreciate something like this . i saw it with a great crowd , fortunately . surprisingly , most of them were teenagers , but they were very respectful . as the film went on , whenever they got to the bedroom sequences the silence was audible . and this was the only movie i think i 've ever seen where people actually screamed . honest to god , there were screams ! and then laughter , because it was very funny to hear that in a theater , but that was okay , too .		8		1
a left hook delivering unstoppable laughter followed by a potent spinning back kick of visually mesmerizing instances combined with a few minor jabs of sentimental profundity topped off with an uppercut of insanely entertaining action sequences send this film flying up the list of animation favorites . there is no reason to believe it fends off the older spectators given its timeless ability to grapple onto the attention of the adults through the knockout sensational fighting scenes and amusing jokes , which unlike other animated movies , do not hover around an style . `` kung fu panda 2 '' does not forget to shatter the criticism of those viewers expecting a film containing a moral or some philosophical idea since it outlines the lesson of finding inner peace within one 's life by learning to coexist harmoniously at present . the viewers themselves , however , could counterattack by arguing that this so-called moral fails to scratch the surface and is trite . nonetheless , `` kung fu panda 2 '' emerges victorious as it provides a well-rounded source of entertainment for this summer .		8		1
i was very intrigued by the story telling and direction style of blake edwards after watching his pink panther series , and thus wanted to explore some of his other noted i came across this movie which is a perfect embodiment of the style of edwards . based on the novel by the famous writer truman capote , this movie can be interpreted in different ways by different viewers . some may call it an out and out chick flick because the story revolves around a new york neurotic woman played by hepburn , some may call it a comedy because of the presence of intelligent humor , some may even call it a racist movie for the controversial depiction of asians -lrb- japanese to be precise -rrb- and some may even call it a movie which is very much ahead of its times . i agree to all these difference of opinions . about the performances , i purely believe that this movie would not have been even half impressive if not for the excellent portrayal by audrey hepburn . she is a livewire on screen , you just can not take your eyes off her . if there is a list of excellent portrayals who were denied the oscar , this particular performance will surely be in that list . i have to mention the cat -lrb- hepburn 's unnamed roommate in the movie -rrb- which probably is the most famous cat in hollywood . the japanese neighbor portrayed by rooney was hilarious . her love interest played by peppard was impressive . overall , it gave me a smile on my face . rating : 8/10		8		1
`` the trouble of growing up in a small town is everybody thinks they know who you are . '' i was initially interested in the killer inside me because i 'm a fan of both casey affleck and jessica alba , but i soon became even more intrigued by what i was reading in the early reviews about how brutal it is . and it is brutal . i do n't mean the over the top , fanciful gore-drenched brutality of a movie like saw , i mean the kind of realistic , stomach - churning violence that is n't easy to watch . this movie is definitely not for everyone , as a result . i just thought i 'd put that disclaimer out there . the story is about a 29 year-old sheriff deputy named lou ford who leads a double life . he 's a sadistic , violent , disturbed man who hides his true nature under the gentlemanly , courteous reputation he has amongst the denizens of the texas town he 's lived in since he was born . an encounter with a local prostitute triggers the violent urges in him that have been somewhat buried , and a cascade of murders upon murders result as he tries to cover his tracks and avoid the scrutiny of a district attorney who is deeply suspicious of him . i though affleck was great in this . the guy is just a natural actor , and he pulls off both the unnerving psychopath and small town local aspects of the character . i wanted ford to get caught for his utterly despicable actions , yet i still found myself feeling anxious whenever he seemed in danger of being found out . if that 's not a compliment of casey 's performance , i do n't know what could be . alba was good in her somewhat limited role , and it was a pretty risk choice for her to tackle a part like this where so much violence was directed at her character . kate hudson also does well in a role that very different from much of her recent work , and simon baker rounds out the main cast with a solid performance as the district attorney . i was drawn into this movie from the opening credits . if you 're not put off by the violence and the sex -lrb- often mixed together -rrb- , the killer inside me is well worth watching . i thought the ending was n't pulled off as well as the rest of the film was , but that 's really my only complaint . recommended .		8		1
i have seen all five of the original films starring roddy macdowall , and the single remake from director tim burton , but none of the films show how the apes grew intelligent enough to walk , talk and take over the world , this prequel finally explains . basically pharmaceutical scientist will rodman -lrb- james franco -rrb- works for company gen-sys who develop solutions and cures to human conditions , and they use captured chimpanzees to experiment on and test their theories and developments . the recent experiments are to try and find a cure to alzheimer 's disease , especially as will 's own father charles -lrb- john lithgow -rrb- suffers from the disease , one chimp is given the prototype drug , but is goes wrong when aggression takes over . with the ape killed , and all the others taken out of the equation will feels broken , but he finds that the injected ape had a baby , and he secretly takes it home to grow up with him , and monitor his progress having inherited the drug effects from his mother . this ape , named caesar -lrb- andy serkis -rrb- grows up very intelligent with the ability to think , solve given tests quickly , and on occasion walk like a human , but also he has a lot of emotion . as time goes by will knows the big reason to keep caesar is to use his blood as a possible cure for his father , and injecting him the experiment is successful and charles improves . but as the ape 's intelligence grows even more and he understands the world around him his emotional side really comes to a head , he becomes bad tempered and attacks a neighbour , forcing the authorities to take him away and put him in a special ape facility . sanctuary owner john landon -lrb- brian cox -rrb- assures will that caesar will be looked after well and feel comfortable amongst regular apes , but of course this is a lie as his son dodge -lrb- harry potter 's tom felton -rrb- tortures him and some of the other apes do feel animosity to him . will , not knowing that caesar is suffering , also has the misfortune of having his father returning to his ill dementia state and losing his memory again , with the effects of the drug passing , but saying it does work to his boss steven jacobs -lrb- the last king of scotland 's david oyelowo -rrb- they restart the experiments of apes again . however he realises the consequences the drug has , it does work on apes and makes them more intelligent , but it has fatal virus qualities and consequences for humans , as infected robert franklin -lrb- tyler labine -rrb- sneezes blood , including on the neighbour -lrb- david hewlett -rrb- , and he is found dead . caesar meanwhile has got all the other apes to band together , and also found a discarded can of the experimental drug that made him intelligent that he spreads to all the other caged apes , so they also gain high intelligence and plan to break out . eventually they manage it , they kill a few of the people at the facility and escape through the roof , and spread out to take over and attack many humans , as they are the ones who have mistreated them in many guises . spreading out and attacking humans they storm their way on the golden gate bridge , and caesar gaining the ability to speak , will is shocked to see this breakout and rebellion by his animal friend , but he allows them to go on and find peace in the forest . in the end caesar and all the other apes seem to calm as soon as they reach the forest seemingly to live in , but they look over the city , so it may continue , and also is seen to be boarding a plane flying to new york , infected with the virus , and seen by flight path animation that it does indeed spread . also starring freida pinto as caroline aranha and as irena . franco gives a good performance as the scientist trying to do good but suffers many hardships in his personal and experimental efforts , the other cast members like cox and felton do well also , and of course serkis , who brought gollum and king kong to life successfully , creates a fantastically emotional caesar , both with high aggression and a tender side . the story is thrilling with the playing god concept , and it gives a good picture of how mistreating we humans can be , and how our overpowering human meddling can go wrong , i.e. we question our morals , the special effects from the team behind avatar to bring the apes to life and create intense action are amazing , and the tiny tributes to the old films , including the catchphrase `` get your stinking paws off me , you damned dirty ape '' -lrb- number 66 on 100 years , 100 quotes -rrb- are good too , an exciting science-fiction thriller . it was nominated the oscar for best visual effects , and it was nominated the bafta for best special visual effects . very good !		8		1
at the age of eight , brian and neil have each gone through an experience that has dictated the nature of their adolescence . brian , a loser at little league baseball , becomes convinced he 's been abducted by aliens , which would explain his blackouts and nosebleeds in childhood , but still leaves him troubled by dreams that he writes down yet ca n't understand . neil , the star player on the baseball team , is well aware he had a sexual relationship with their coach at the age of eight , and as a teenager has become a gay hustler picked up by older men . the experience of one boy is the key to the other 's behavior . they may be two sides of the same damaged ego . in most of the movie they circle around in their separate dysfunctional orbits till they meet and a tender , sad epiphany happens . as a closer look at pedophilia , `` mysterious skin '' -lrb- which is now rated nc-17 -rrb- contains elements that are unthinkable in mainstream terms . to say this is not a movie for everyone is putting it mildly . but for those who can stick with it , it proves thought-provoking and original . the story offers alternative versions of what happens when a thirty-something man with access as a little league coach seduces or abuses . using flashback scenes and voice-overs , the movie shows this happening , and then cuts forward to the present life of the boys in their late teens . the line between seduction and abuse seems defined by the sexuality and degree of willingness of the child . since the tough , cocky neil -lrb- joseph gordon-levitt -rrb- declares he always was attracted to much older guys and came for the first time while spying on his mom having sex with a dumb hunk of a man , he would describe the coach 's action as seduction . the coach 's behavior leaves more delicate youths clearly traumatized . for us the coach may be weird and sick , but we see him through neil 's eyes as ingratiating and good looking -- we may be horrified , but he is n't demonized on screen . neither is he an object of bleeding heart sympathy . though the boys react differently , they wind up equally damaged by what the coach did . this is not only heavy stuff but , except for the continuing gay focus , it 's also in striking contrast to director gregg araki 's earlier movies . well into his forties now though he may not want to admit it , araki has decided to turn serious . movies like `` the living end , '' `` totally f *** ed up , '' `` the doom generation , '' and `` splendor '' were wild personal improvisations that made araki the infant terrible of the new queer cinema in the nineties . they presented issues in an outrageous , sexy , and funny way . araki 's images were bright colored , , and intensely lit , and his gay idol and muse was the impossibly handsome james duval . this time the risk-taking young actor joseph gordon-levitt has the duval role , but it 's all different , beginning with gordon-levitt 's scrawny hardness . `` mysterious skin '' is an adaptation from a novel by scott heim . it 's set in a realistic -lrb- if sometimes dreamy -rrb- context in heim 's actual birthplace , the little town of hutchinson , kansas , and in new york city . this time araki moves us toward painful clarity rather than mad apocalypse . when neil becomes a hustler , he begins by `` having '' every man in the one-horse town , picking them up in a desolate park . neil 's promiscuous , alcoholic mom -lrb- elizabeth shue -rrb- , to whom he 's unnaturally close , has hardly provided a model of caution or restraint . his best friend wendy -lrb- michelle trachtenberg -rrb- says he has a big dark empty space where his heart should be . but when he and wendy move to new york and he enters a more dangerous round of johns , encountering violence and 's sarcoma , it becomes clear that he 's not quite as tough or as experienced as he seemed . the bespectacled , brian -lrb- brady corbet -rrb- stumbles , remaining at home like a little boy to the age of nineteen , but eventually trying to track down what really happened to him , which leads to becoming best friends with neil 's former sidekick the openly gay eric -lrb- jeff licon -rrb- and at christmastime culminates in a reunion with neil . leading up to this brian has gotten involved , to his ultimate distress , with a young woman named avalyn -lrb- mary lynn rajskub -rrb- who claims to have been abducted by aliens herself . it 's she who urges him to investigate the other boy he keeps dreaming of . araki 's previous daring obviously still shows in the bold and emotionally complex treatment of pedophilia and its aftereffects . the coach 's are made clear , if not shown graphically -- and the treatment avoids gratuitous moralizing , though remaining far away from advocating precepts . the material here relates to recent movies like `` capturing the , '' `` l.i.e. . , '' and jonathan caouette 's `` tarnation '' that deal with issues of gay coming of age in a context of abuse and pedophilia , but it 's more searching and sexual than they are . the actors are good , particularly gordon-levitt and corbet . not all elements are perfection , though . the story itself suffers from a certain aimlessness and lack of detail . should n't the possibility that seduced youths may grow up into their own careers of have been alluded to ? the contrasting oscillation between the two main characters does n't always work . the secondary characters tend to be one-dimensional -- a sign that araki 's improvisatory background does n't always serve him in the new more realistic context . but the originality is still there , and the element of dreaminess introduces a poetic quality that 's almost worthy of gus van sant at his best . the final epiphany brings clarity , but no healing . one walks out not so much angry as stunned and horrified .		8		1
shaun of the dead ai n't just a great piece of british movie making , its also one of the greatest achievements in the past year , 2004 . dawn of the dead being the movie 's basic influence is never really being made fun out , cause this ai n't a parody of any kind , this is original horror/comedy that features dawn of the dead plot . shaun live in the basement of an apartment in london , together with his lazy buddy ed . having lazy days running by their life seems to be ; nothing ! shaun 's girlfriend leaves him and his having problems with his mum and da . . stepdad . being in a heavy heartbreaking time , he and his friends simply do n't follow up with the everyday world going by . and soon ; london is a city filled with man-eating zombies . . one man has to stop the madness ; shaun ... shaun of the dead is simply a small masterpiece . featuring hilarious scenes as when ed and shaun starts throwing old records at two zombies in their garden , discussing what 's worth throwing and not . the genius plan by shaun , where everybody 's smiling like it was all a fancy commercial . or ; the great achievements of `` you 've got red on you '' , the typical comedy gold of shaun trying to take a short-cut over a fence ... i could go on for ever . shaun of the dead is truly one of the funniest movies ever made ; and its a coming cult classic ! it 's got a lots of the same monty python achievements of originality and exciting comedy , and being a success world wide ! great use of music in queen 's upbeat hard rocker `` do n't stop me now '' and being placed in one of the movie 's must ass-kicking scenes . or ; the fabulous use of queen returning with `` you 're my best friend '' at the end . shaun of the dead is a great piece of movie ! stars : 5/5		8		1
bit of a cop-out ending but who can complain when the whole ride has been as creepy as this ? zohra lampert puts in a great performance in the central and crucial role and she plays the little bit sane role very well indeed . she has good support , especially from mariclare costello who plays another ambiguous character . the most unusual soundtrack is particularly unnerving but then so is almost everything . hancock does a great job of constantly keeping us on our toes , ready to worry at every shadow and reflection and if this is not ` action packed ' it is certainly non stop scary . a very strong finish -lrb- before that very end -rrb- concludes a super low key horror movie .		8		1
the much awaited `` the matrix reloaded '' by andy and larry wachowski is entertaining , great looking , bewildering , and ultimately an exercise in making a big budget movie , `` because i can '' rather than making a complete movie -- which the matrix was . i liked the movie , although there is something missing in this one . `` reloaded '' clarifies the matrix , and then goes down the path of layered coupled with both and buddhist references . what is the oracle ? and who is the architect of the matrix ? is neo really the one ? the acting is uneven . and is this surprising given the quality of the first movie . lawrence fishburne really chews up the scenery in a couple scenes as morpheus . keanu reeves and carrie-anne moss fare much better by underplaying their roles . my friend , carrie-anne , is very good -- i thought . then again i am biased in this . as trinity , carrie-anne is strong , sexy , and vulnerable . keanu returning as neo is efficient , and perhaps a little too stoic for the evolving role of the chosen one . the visuals in reloaded are absolutely stunning -- the highway sequence is totally amazing . the fighting sequences are excellent . the one thing that was missing for me , was an emotional investment and payoff . reloaded is high on cool , and very out . at times it is like -lrb- really when you think about it -rrb- the wizard of oz jacked on steroids and coke . however , reloaded lacks some of the charm and humanity of the matrix . this may be one of the dangers or pitfalls of catching a messiah tale in act 2 . `` reloaded '' is also a bit significant about itself . what made the matrix great , is that it was a cool action movie with a rather novel concept . people just read significance into it . at times `` reloaded '' is a convoluted philosophical sledgehammer . anyway , i may be too far down the rabbit hole on this one ...		8		1
after watching this psychological horror film directed by adrian lyne and written by bruce joel rubin , you would end up with nightmares , too . the movie indeed delivers . the story centers around vietnam veteran jacob singer -lrb- tim robbins -rrb- , whose experiences both prior and during the war have resulted in abnormal flashbacks and haunting hallucinations to the point where he ca n't tell which reality is and which is fantasy . in his ordeal , he becomes worse , living in what might be call hell on earth for him . jacob must desperately try to figure out the truth about what had happened during his service in vietnam and what is happening to him now . the movie drew from several inspirations for its story and effects , from such works as 1962 's short film an occurrence at owl creek bridge and the paintings of francis bacon . there are a number of familiar themes and symbolism in this film that makes the movie a thinking man 's film . this is a story with many possible interpretations , each valid . the movie 's setting can most closely be associated with purgatory , but another facet of this masterpiece is that it should be seen in within a christian context . the film 's title refers to the biblical story of jacob 's ladder or the dream of a meeting place between heaven and earth in the book of genesis . its little-known alternate title is dante 's inferno , in a reference to the painting inferno by dante alighieri . surprising , one of the biggest influences for the film came from the tibetan book of the dead where the writer spent two years in a tibetan buddhist monastery in nepal before writing this film . it can also be interpretation as marxist to some . a marxist could say that jacobs role as a postman was a bourgeois attempt to control proletarians by making them imagine they are leading a surreal life . when jacob was hanging around the subway and hallucinating , he could have been coming to terms with the grief of being proletarian . that would explain why he saw deformed human figures on a train . i also see gestalt psychology in this film . gestalt dream interpretation upholds the principle that everything in a dream somehow is an aspect of the dreamer himself/herself . this is one reason why i support the idea that everybody is a personification of jacob himself dealing with guilt over what he thinks he 's done to his army buddies . still , i have no idea about the interpretations of this movie , it 's just a few ideas out there . the movie can be a bit confusing as it shifts back and forth between jacob 's chaotic memories of vietnam , to this prior war memories , and then back to his present life as a mailman . half of the time , you do n't know what is going on . there is so many different sub-plots that it is hard to figure things out . you do n't know if the army is out to get him , or if he is insane , or he 's been dead the whole time . about the drug ` ladder ' . there are some theories that jacob create the drug as he was a doctor before the war . in my opinion , there is no real drug in the movie . the drug is a metaphor of what triggers wars throughout history greed , anger , hatred . the more you go down the ladder , the more you come close to your primal state : anger , fear , aggression for survival . -lrb- elizabeth pena -rrb- is a depiction of his life temptations and his refusal to die . i just wish they explain more about this character and make clearer . the movie can be a bit of a twist , but honestly , it 's pretty predictable . the movie is just creepy to the point that it influence other horror movies . it even did influence the silent hill video games series . one of the scariest scenes in the film is the hospital ride from hell with all those shaking bodies . it give me goose bumps . the film was too overwhelming to some audience , that about 20 minutes of disturbing scenes , mostly from the last third of the film , were removed from the final cut . watch the director cut version that have all these scenes add to it , it 's one of the few films that the director cut was better than the original . there are moments of nonsensical over the top horror clichés that the movie added . i do have to say it 's better than the original screenplay . it was just too explicit and too obvious . in a sense , i think the movie was more ` realistic ' . the out of place things can be explain if you think about it . through this spiritual journey , he encounters the spirits of his friends . all the actors did pretty well in their roles : elizabeth peña as jezebel `` jezzie '' , danny aiello as louis and even macaulay culkin as gabe singer . in my opinion , macaulay looks out of place in this film . tim robbins was great in the film . he was just amazing . just watch his reaction in the ` dream on ' scene . very heart breaking . this is really a great movie . an effective deep and dark film with a light message of peace and spirituality well-executed . requires multiple viewings .		8		1
when i saw the previews for baby mama i had to chuckle . i mean it looked amusing enough and they always show the funniest clips in the trailer if they are smart . still as soon as i saw amy poehler starring in the movie i figured it to be extremely stupid and slapstick and probably a lot of unfunny dirty diaper jokes and the likes . but i was still anxious to check it out and hope that it turned out to be funny . i am glad i gave it the chance because as it turned out it was n't as silly as i thought it would be and actually turned in a sweet , cute , funny little performance . it was n't perfect but it was fun and definitely entertaining . writer and director michael mccullers certainly knows comedy and has written enough quirky comedies including austin powers , and many saturday night live skits , but this is his first entry directing and he does a solid job with a very well rounded cast . although you 'd figure that the whole angle has been done to death and the jokes would be played out but everything works really well . tina fey leads the cast as aspiring mother and determined business woman , kate holbrook , who wants a child but not at the expense of her career . fey is a very talented comedienne under the right circumstances and she plays the straight `` woman '' very well . her comedy is more in physical comedy and the looks and the sarcasm . still she leads the film quite well . honestly i ca n't stand amy poehler , even on snl but surprisingly she is a lot less annoying than she usually is and carries her role pretty well as immature mother to be angie ostrowiski . apparently poehler and fey are off screen best friends and it kind of shows because they look like they are having a great time together . they do play their roles very good together and play off each other perfectly . greg kinnear is shop owner rob ackerman who plays fey 's love interest . the romance is n't very well developed and very underplayed which is unfortunate considering fay and kinnear are good together and both give good solid performances . dax shepard is rather stereotypical and annoying as poehler 's husband carl . i always find shepard rather annoying and this is no exception even if he gives some chuckles from stupidity alone . the cameos are fantastic especially the amazing steve martin as barry , fey 's new age boss , and sigourney weaver as the head of a private fertility clinic . both are hilarious and do a great job !! now in all that i 've said the movie is n't mind blowingly good and it wo n't be your favorite film but it 's worthy of the time and money you spend to see it . it 's light and fluffy and actually has some very cute moments and might even be considered a great `` chick flick '' with fey and poehler in strong female leads that are not insulting in any way which i found surprising somehow . regardless go into the movie with an open mind ... not that it 'll make you a better person by watching it but you might smile despite yourself and feel better for watching it because it 's fun and there is nothing wrong with that . 8/10		8		1
philip kaufman 's chilling take on `` invasion of the body snatchers '' has range , depth , emotion -lrb- a dangerous thing -rrb- , and state-of-the-art visuals -lrb- effects and normal shots alike -rrb- . it still remains the best adaptation of a story that has been beaten to death -lrb- thanks mostly now to nicole kidman and daniel craig -rrb- . this particular adaptation is more about average seventies paranoia than anything else , with donald sutherland , brooke adams , jeff goldblum , and veronica cartwright as people who realize something is wrong when they start to notice the people around them changing . leonard nimoy gives his best performance as dr. david kibner , a psychiatrist -lrb- psychologist ? i always get them confused -rrb- who does n't believe in their wild stories even though there 's really nothing that wild about them on the surface . so , yes , everybody 's changing . and it 's all thanks to aliens that migrate to earth on solar winds -lrb- explained here in a visually stunning opening sequence -rrb- . sadly , the action occasionally shifts to clunky , and kibner 's attitude really begins to irritate after a while . but kudos to everybody -- particularly cartwright -- for helping to make this a highly memorable invasion .		8		1
okay fine the title is a little cheesy but regardless this is one heck of a good movie with a great performance by gene hackman . now what i really found interesting about this movie was that in a way the director and/or writer tried to make a statement by saying that racism is taught . which i belief is true ! there is this great scene where the two agents are viewing a film of a kkk member , giving a speech while you see little kids walking around dressed like the clan . interesting huh ? 3 -lrb- *** -rrb- out of 4 -lrb- **** -rrb- stars		8		1
this interesting little film is set in a small town in france in 1960 . into a very conservative and self-satisfied town comes a strange bohemian lady and her young daughter to open a chocolate shop . the fact that the child has no father and the shop opens during lent sends some of the townspeople into a tizzy -- particularly the mayor who is like a human version of sam the eagle from the `` muppet show '' -- both in looks and attitude . despite the concerted efforts of many to drive her out of business , the lady 's business survives -- thanks to candy that seems to work magic on those who consume it . later , a group of gypsies arrive and for once , they are the most hated residents of the town -- not the chocolatier . how all this anger and animosity is worked out is something you 'll just need to see for yourself . now some might watch this film and assume it is an attack on religion -- it sure looks that way through much of the film . on one hand , you have the who is good and never goes to church and on the other you have church goers who are all hypocrites . however , please do n't give up on the film , as you later see that the lady does not have all the answers and the film is not an attack on religion , per se , but an attack on those who have a dogmatic devotion to rules and thereby ignore the spirit of christianity . in many ways the film reminds me of antonia -lrb- best foreign picture winner , 1995 -rrb- except that unlike antonia , this film is not meant as an angry attack on religion and seems less rabidly feminist . both films actually have a very similar message , but chocolat is much more subtle and less angry -- meaning it 's a film that can be appreciated by most anyone regardless of their political or religious persuasion -- especially since the film seems to call for religious reform not the elimination of religion altogether . also , oddly , the film reminded me quite a bit of another dutch film , ja zuster , nee zuster -lrb- yes sister , no sister -rrb- . both feature a nice leading lady and her small group of friends who are constantly attacked by a very conservative and fun-hating neighbor who eventually comes to accept them in the end . about the only serious negative in the film is johnny depp 's character . he looks scruffy -- just like depp looks in real life . considering this film was set in 1960 , he really is an anachronism -- being a 21st century hippie-like character plopped down in the early 1960s . his character just did n't make a lot of sense . regardless , this is a fun and highly entertaining film . aside from a couple tiny scenes that make the film inappropriate for young kids , this is a film you can let your kids see -lrb- making it quite unlike antonia -rrb- .		8		1
after the economical failure of the film edge of darkness and the scandals from his private life , it would seem that mel gibson 's career as a hollywood star has finished . fortunately , there are still some people who remember the talent which distinguished him in previous decades ; and now , thanks to director jodie foster , we have the opportunity to confirm that that talent keeps being untouchable , because even though i do not think that the beaver will resurrect gibson 's career , it definitely shows that he keeps being an excellent actor with the ability of bringing complicated and realistic characters to life . in the beaver , her third film as a director , foster shows a good narrative sense and a sober style which perfectly complements the actors ' work . i think that that was a very good achievement in a movie like this one , which requires us to believe the main character 's mental fracture , and to accept the beaver as a real and well defined character . and that is where gibson 's extraordinary performance comes in . his work impressed me mostly during the first scenes which reveal the beaver 's existence , because even though they have an humorous tone , gibson 's work adds a subtext of anguish and desperation which feels devastating . there are a few moments where the movie looses its delicate balance between humor and drama ; in fact , the intense emotional climax briefly falls into the involuntary humor ; but the movie immediately recovers from that fails because of the performances and the solid control that foster -lrb- as a director -rrb- shows over the difficult material . there is a sub-plot which kinda feels like a filler , in which we see the personal and academic problems from the main character 's son , who runs a business of writing school works for students who pay for them . that curious occupation puts him in contact with a young woman , with whom starts an unexpected romance . i ignore how relevant that parallel story is , but that did not bother me very much , because it feels honest , and anton yelchin and jennifer lawrence bring solid performances . in conclusion , gibson shows his range once more in this movie , thanks to the instinctive comprehension of his character . and even though foster also brings a very good performance in here , it was her work as director what impressed me the most from her , because she could find the exact tone to tell an unusual story . i honestly went to see the beaver with neutral expectations , but i ended up enjoying this film pretty much , so i can recommend it .		8		1
playing the title role in the lincoln lawyer is matthew mcconaughey so nicknamed because he conducts most of his business from his lincoln town car which is chauffeured by laurence mason . as he has to travel to and from various courts , this makes it a whole easier . and the car and mason thereby become a business expense . roy cohn would have been proud . mcconaughey is no idealist , his services come at a price . but it turns out he has some scruples and they are put to the test when rich boy ryan phillippe and his mother frances fisher hire him to defend ryan when he 's arrested for rape . he was literally caught in the act as two neighbors broke in and held him for the cops for raping marguerite levieva . due to the canons of the bar association ethics mcconaughey finds himself in a jackpot similar to the one al pacino found himself when he played a young idealistic lawyer in and justice for all . but the results are a whole lot different because mcconaughey is not an idealist and he makes those canons work for him . the film looks like the pilot of a tv series , but i doubt we 'll get any of the big name stars there if such a thing comes to pass . marisa tomei co-stars as mcconaughey 's ex-wife and a prosecutor to boot . ca n't imagine what broke that marriage up . william h. macy has a key role in this film as well as a private investigator who works for mcconaughey and does very well in it . the lincoln lawyer is a very well done addition to the legal cinema with a cast that fills its roles out to a `` t '' . i would really recommend renting the al pacino classic and justice for all and see the very great similarities and key differences in both of these films .		8		1
stalag 17 , though only a good ol' american testosterone-driven entertainment , is a great piece of direction on the part of the true master it bears at the helm , billy wilder . wilder flaunts the atmosphere of a screwball comedy , and fires off a lot of gags you would probably only find in one . simultaneously , he builds very stern suspense with inherent tension and subtle mechanisms set by a few characters . the film 's plot screens a lot of very tense things that get us all worked up . it 's about a character that deals with false accusations by an entire pow camp full of men that while they 're in prison at least have each other . this character does not . he 's excluded , beaten , and can only think about that one character who is smugly getting away with all that he 's being accused of . and then again , in the undercurrent , there 's this interesting crop of quirky characters that populate the stalag . there 's a big , scruffy lug named animal who looks like an american danny trejo and could break a few chains apart at once , but he 's got an insufferable crush on betty grable , and when the news is heard that grable is married , animal falls apart . he 's got a smaller friend with a higher voice who gets caught up in mishaps with him , like a mixture of abbott and costello and george and lenny from of mice and men . then there 's a guy who shows up at the camp who can do impressions of any actor , and does throughout the film . stalag 17 is a great american counterpart to grand illusion , perhaps . the only difference is that stalag 17 all but ignores the war and closes in completely on the characters themselves , using the period in time as an incidental part of the plot . it 's pure entertainment , and beautifully done by a master of such .		8		1
the lion king seems to be the disney animated movie that everyone absolutely loves . it is a movie that is absolutely perfect and ca n't be touched , there is simply nothing wrong with it . now i actually did n't grow up with this film , i remember watching it once when i was little , and then the next time i remember seeing it was when i was seventeen . so do i like this film ? yes , i think it 's a pretty damn good film , but it is n't my favorite animated movie of all time . first , the animation is absolutely beautiful . this has to be some of the best 2d animation in the history of animation . the colors are bright and vibrant , and every aspect has detail . on a technical level this film is a masterpiece . but there is more to this film that works than just animation . the characters are likable too . the relationship between mufasa and simba feels like a real father-son relationship , and you feel sad when mufasa dies . the villain is great in the first half , he 's so great at being bad , and he 's funny too . the romance feels genuine , and some of the songs are fantastic , my personal favorite being `` i just ca n't wait to be king . '' now for some downsides , despite a lot of time given to the development of simba 's father , i ca n't even remember his mom 's name . and while scar was great in the first half , in the last half , he sort of became just a spoiled brat , which is pretty much what simba was in the first half , scar just became kind of bland . and timon and pumbaa are half and half with me personally , sometimes their funny , sometimes their just annoying . there are a few other small nitpicks , but overall , this is a really good movie . it has great animation , great songs , a good message , and interesting characters , for the most part . and it does make me laugh at times . it may not be my favorite disney movie , but it 's still a really good film .		8		1

i could lie and say i think `` ghostbusters ii '' is an inferior sequel to the original 1984 `` ghostbusters , '' but `` ghostbusters ii '' is an entertaining film in its own right . nothing can come close to the gleaming perfection of the first film but damn it , the sequel works in most places . it 's chiefly because the movie is just so damn entertaining ! it 's still mostly watchable despite its flaws and misjudgments about what the filmmakers may have seen as an apparent mean-spiritedness in a lot of people during the late '80s . true , comedian and star bill murray still steals the show whenever he gets the chance and he also gets some of the best lines , and he 's just so gosh-darn funny as a leading man . screenwriter dan aykroyd and harold ramis are also in top form , and it shows in their wily and hilarious script . unlike the first picture , though , it seems like they took the family-friendly route and did n't feel like building up to the tone of the first film -lrb- even though `` ghostbusters '' was still pretty funny aside from the occasional dark tone -rrb- . and also , director ivan reitman knows their material and it looks like the filmmakers made the wise decision of bringing back everybody from the original film , including sigourney weaver and rick moranis . it 's been five years since the first film -lrb- a title card confirms it -rrb- , and it seems that most of new york city does n't even remember who the ghostbusters are and what they did for the city . everyone in the city is miserable and the opening moments confirm that as well . after being almost bankrupted by countless lawsuits and being unable to practice their trade because of a judicial restraining order , the boys are reduced to moonlighting in other fields , such as catering to the needs of spoiled yuppie children at their birthday parties , a task that neither ray stanz -lrb- aykroyd -rrb- or winston zeddemore -lrb- ernie hudson -rrb- take pride in . egon spengler -lrb- ramis -rrb- is the only one of the original ghostbusters who seems to have actually moved on with his life . peter venkman -lrb- murray -rrb- hosts a television show called `` the world of the psychic , '' a show that apparently draws in modest ratings but no respected psychic will appear on his show because they think he 's a fraud . anyway , things get underway when the boys discover that nasty pink slime of supernatural origin is discovered building up underneath the city , something that old friend and venkman 's old flame dana barrett -lrb- weaver -rrb- realizes first hand when the slime attacks her infant son , and it 's an investigation they have to do on the down-low because of their current legal situation . this slime , they learn , feeds off the misery and stress of a downtrodden new york city , and it 's only getting stronger as the holidays are approaching . but because no one believes in ghosts anymore , their task is even more difficult . well , after ghost-busting the two ghouls that crash in on their trial hearing , we have no choice but to be ready to believe them . they 're back in business , all right - with cynical janine melnitz -lrb- annie potts -rrb- answering the phones and louis tully -lrb- moranis -rrb- on the books - tracing the source of their ghost-busting investigations to a 17th-century moldavian tyrant named vigo the carpathian who wants in on the 20th century , and has possessed museum curator janosz poha -lrb- a hilarious peter macnicol -rrb- to go out and kidnap dana 's son so he can have a body so he can live again . one thing `` ghostbusters ii '' provides for the viewer is solid entertainment , which is what any good sequel should do . it would be impossible for this movie to any way live up to the original , so you ca n't blame the filmmakers for at least trying -lrb- trying is italicized -rrb- . it would be pointless to say that the acting is good from our players , but my god , they 're good and again in top form . the special effects are still pretty impressive , even from their early ghost-busting capers , to a finale where the boys are actually able to walk down the streets of the city in an animated - yes , animated ! - statue of liberty -lrb- yes , lady liberty has sprung to life , and good thing she 's on our side ! -rrb- . and even the titanic -lrb- do n't ask , just watch -rrb- pops up too . `` ghostbusters ii '' has n't been particularly well-received , even despite its more family-friendly tone and message about the folly of mean-spiritedness . but it 's just a good sequel , nonetheless , not bad , not superior to the original , maybe on par with the original , but it 's just really good fun . 8/10		8		1
carpenter rounded off his eighties career with they live , an action and sci-fi mix with all the usual carpenter traits , but which also works as a propaganda piece , and seems to have influenced films such as the matrix . it is a film about unseen forces controlling us , about speaking out and taking action , rather than sitting back and accepting that what you see is the way the world should be . featuring many good ideas , minimal and cool dialogue , shady characters and unlikely heroes , they live is considered by many as carpenter 's last good film , though i have enjoyed most of what he has done since . the film begins with a drifter walking into town , looking for any sort of work . his name is nada , though this is never said , and he eventually finds work at a building site . there he meets frank who introduces him to his slum neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city . pirate tv broadcasts tell of the upper class getting richer , and the middle class being drained . nada sees that these broadcasts are coming from a nearby church , but is warned not to get involved or the cops will take him away . when one day the church is raided , nada finds a box of sunglasses . when he wears a pair he begins to see things - advertisements turn to slogans such as ` sleep ' and ` obey ' , and realises that aliens are walking disguised amongst them , mostly the rich people . he grabs a gun and begins killing them , trying to find out why , who , from where etc. . he meets holly who works for a tv station and tries to convince her , but she does n't believe him and calls the cops . after a long fight nada manages to give frank a pair , and he too sees what has been hidden from the public . they find the people who made the glasses , and set out to stop the aliens who are using humans , and other planets as resources for their own wealth . this works as a social commentary on class , wealth , the politics of the time , and as an anti-war message for today . invasion and subtle control are tolerated until a few rebels realise the truth and fight back . we should not be content with buying what we think makes us look good and become numb and dumb . roddy piper of wwf fame gives a fine performance as nada , and of course his strength is exploited . keith david is as strong as always , and foster looks chilling and distant . the effects are still effective even if they do resemble something from the forties , and the story is good . after a slow start things speed up towards a typically carpenter ending . this is another good film by carpenter which lacks the best scares of the thing and the fun of big trouble , but still is greatly entertaining and worth watching . 8 out of 10		8		1
a mysterious fog that houses a vengeful ghostly presence . a 100 year old murderous conspiracy . a frightened disc jockey menaced at her station , mysterious strangers banging on front doors with rusty hooks in the middle of the night , a town and some ships off shore full of potential victims : what 's not to like ? this one 's a brilliant horror classic . i 've seen this several times , and the frights and brutal violence remain effective . this was a well written story , chock full of colorful characters , both human and ghostly . the back story on the invaders is unique , and , oddly enough , sensitively explained . events occur in a logical order of gathering intensity , and the film is n't afraid to kill off people you do n't expect . a couple of characters are clichéd , such as the mayor and her sidekick , but most are believable . the acting is normally quite good . look for scream queens jamie lee curtis and janet leigh , and hal holbrook as the priest who uncovers an evil act worse than anything the fog 's killers have done . but best of all is adrienne barbeau as the dj who appeals in a panic to her radio listeners to flee for their lives . the writers may have gotten the idea for killers concealing themselves in fog from an old drive-in quickie : `` the crawling eye . '' although ce was incredibly campy , the sight of the fog itself moving upon its victims worked quite well , and in the fog , the unseen menace hiding inside the fog is again effective . however , this time , when the creatures are revealed , they are ingeniously filmed as faceless silhouettes shrouded in the fog 's light , making them both ethereal and threatening . throw in that pounding score which accompanies the advance of the fog over the town , and this one provides all the horror scares you could ask for . good horror flick -lrb- far better than that ridiculous trash remake made recently -rrb- , which is fun to watch .		8		1
robert zemekis -lrb- along with actors michael j. fox as marty mcfly and christopher lloyd as dr. emmett brown -rrb- return to complete the trilogy in this very entertaining and satisfying conclusion , which sees marty stranded in 1955 after the older dr. brown is sent back to 1885 in the de lorean . he is helped by the young dr. brown to use the same de lorean -lrb- left behind in 1885 for marty -rrb- to get back to 1985 , but instead uses it to go back to 1885 to rescue him , since he learns that he 'll be gunned down by buford tannen -lrb- thomas wilson again -rrb- doc does n't want to leave though , since he has fallen in love with a new schoolteacher clara -lrb- played by mary steenburgen -rrb- who is also destined to die ... highly entertaining completion to the saga is great fun throughout , making clever use of its ideas and culture differences , but doing so with the same good-natured charm of the first . grand ending with them reunited by the `` train '' ... though a further installment has yet to arrive . -lrb- which is fine by me ! -rrb-		8		1
it 's disingenuous to only point out the faults in this enjoyable film . for one , the central role played by carrie mulligan is so winning , layered and strong , that she nearly eclipses anything else around . and her supporting cast peter sarsgaard , dominic cooper and rosamund pike are equally strong ; but it 's mulligan -- who 's in just about every scene -- who we become protective of even as she makes choices that put her at the brink . from the raucous opening credits each step the film makes moves closer to disaster , but we 're put in the odd position of seeing mulligan 's very point that her life is boring and what 's the point of memorizing all that latin vocabulary as one character points out , `` rumor has it latin wo n't be spoken in the very near future . '' based on a woman 's account of her reaching maturity , i suppose we 're stuck with the facts at hand . but in today 's moral climate , watching a sixteen year old being seduced by someone who 's considerably older , urging her to skip not just her classes but the future her parents have planned -lrb- an oxford education -rrb- to lead a life of fraud and deceit and no one around her seems to object ... at least object very strenuously seems unconvincing . saarsgard as our humbert humbert is sensational , but in an all british cast , you 're called upon occasionally to ask why they used an american as his accent is n't always right . the script does n't give him enough to convince -lrb- at least me -rrb- of his charm in his scenes with the parents of this young girl . their eagerness to suspend any question as to motive of this older suitor seemed doubtful . while we 're given a speech late in the film by mulligan when all the accusations are put on the table , she 's cast in the role of being wiser than everyone in the cast , while at the same time asserting that she 's not . yet , it 's fun to watch . looking back at my budding adolescence there were these kinds of characters around who wanted to lead young people `` astray . '' i grew up in roughly the same time-frame as the central character , and i can assure you school administrators , teachers , and parents -- as well as peers -- were well coached to watch out for these kinds of temptations . the scandal for all involved -- who knew what was going on -- would have led to dismissal and public scorn -lrb- and in fact , i can remember a few cases where that very thing happened -rrb- . so , we 're asked to look at this situation with our moral compass in both era 's : the 1960 's and the new millennium . and while the outcome may be what actually happened , it 's hurried and as equally unconvincing as someone letting their daughter fly off to paris with an older man .		8		1
will smith plays the last man on earth in the 3 or so adaptation of i am legend . it 's a film that is good but not great . it 's got good visuals and scares but i ca n't quite say that it 's one of the best films of the decade . i bring that up for one reason mostly . ben lyons , roger ebert 's original replacement on at the movies , said that it was one of the best films ever . that guy is mentally challenged or something . he did n't really like doubt . i can assure you that i am legend is not better than doubt , but it is still an enjoyable film . there is n't all that much to the plot . will smith plays robert neville , a scientist who is the last man on earth . he is immune to the disease that occurred years ago . this disease was the cure for cancer , and everyone was actually infected by it . so neville tries to survive nowaday from the infected zombies . he soon finds a way to cure the zombie like people . but he ca n't quite help at the moment . zombie-like things are n't that understanding . smith is really the only famous person in this movie . though emma thompson makes an appearance in the beginning . i will repeat myself once more . and hopefully i wo n't have to do it again . i am legend ai n't art . it does n't really come close . it scared me a few times and you know i actually think will smith can act . i know he likes to do `` oh hell no ! '' throughout everyone of his films , but i like him . smith is good , the visuals are good , this is a good movie .		8		1
i feel no guilt for partaking in any of my pleasures , but i 'm not quite sure if praising this garish trash is consistent with my usual critical measuring sticks . `` bundy '' is everything i expected from mathew bright , the director of `` freeway '' . it may not be the definitive look at charismatic killer ted bundy , but it captures the killer 's lurid lifestyle and dishes up the exploitation elements with a trowel . it is filled with naked women , grisly murder , rape and melodrama . bright takes a sledgehammer to the material and eschews suspense for creepiness and truth for depictions of bundy 's crimes . it is an entertaining brew , directed with an undisguised sense of ghoulish curiosity and delivered to an audience like a plate of steaming intestines . i loved it .		8		1
`` urban legend '' though nothing great has to be one of the better horror flicks of the past decade . the film is done in a surprise and stylish kind of way with a plot that twist in the end . set in a new england college town that supposedly has a tradition of murder and havoc , one by one as tales are passed down from generations of students the murders of college students one by one start to return . natalie -lrb- alicia witt -rrb- who 's a lonely and shy new student will end up oddly enough finding herself at the center of these sadistic murders believed to be inspired by urban legends . upon the 25th anniversary of some murders this party turns out to be a surprise twist . overall nothing great still a watch for some pure horror and suspense fun .		8		1
director : stanley kubrick cast : ryan o'neil , marisa berenson , patrick magee stanley kubrick is my favorite director and barry lyndon is one of his least recognized films . the reason for it 's less popularity is that the movie is very much unlike kubrick . we get to see a different kubrick style in this movie , and i am not complaining . to begin with , the movie is set in the 17th century and requires costumes , sets and mannerisms of that era . kubrick being the perfectionist he is , has taken care of every minute detail . the movie is about an irish guy named redmond barry and his rags to riches and back to rags story . the central character of redmond lyndon is a very complex character to say the least . kubrick has explored almost all human emotions from pride , lust , love to anger , hate , betrayal , jealousy and power . kubrick plays with the viewer in the sense that at one instance the viewer feels for barry lyndon and at the other instance hates him to the core . in short , the character has too many layers and inner shades , the viewer gets to explore in the course of the movie . along with all this , kubrick does not forget the satire he is so frequently associated with . the satirical comments are on that era and made via a narrator who narrates for the entire course of the movie . the technical aspects of the movie are brilliant . great cinematography which is a feature of all kubrick movies is seen here as well . according to me , this movie has the best cinematography than all other kubrick movies . in short , kubrick brings 17th century united kingdom alive on the screen . about the acting , the lead role played by ryan o'neil is average to say the least . i personally felt , some other actor would have taken this movie to even greater heights . kubrick fans will love this movie and enjoy every frame of it . others might find the 3 hour ordeal as boring and a waste of time . thus , i will not openly recommend it . rating : 8/10		8		1

'' any animated movie that was released during 2010 is inevitably going to be compared to toy story 3 , so let 's get that out of the way , first . no , despicable me is not `` better '' than toy story 3 . on an emotional and story-telling level , it 's not nearly as profound or involving . but despicable me is n't trying to be profound , it 's aiming for amusement and entertainment . and on those two fronts , dreamworks has a definite success on their hands . my favorite thing about despicable me is how humorous it is . this is seriously the funniest animated movie that i 've seen in quite a while . it has the expected amount of jokes that will give kids -lrb- and older people , too -rrb- the giggles , as well as lots of comedy that only the grown-up crowd will appreciate . it 's fun to see what will pop up next -lrb- keep your eyes open for a particularly amusing reference to a particularly scene in the godfather -rrb- . despicable me is also a vivid , bright movie that 's pleasing to the eye in all the right ways . the character designs are stylized and fun , the soundtrack is a nice change of pace for this kind of film , and the pacing is excellent , with nary a dull stretch . the voice talent is great , but i will admit that most of them were pretty much unrecognizable . i would n't have known that jason segel , kristin wiig , russell brand , julie andrews , or will arnett were even involved , if not for the credits and the fact that i had read about them beforehand . steve carell and jack mcbrayer -lrb- in a small but hilarious part -rrb- are really the only voices that are easily recognizable . that 's not a criticism , just an observation . so yeah , it 's pretty clear that i liked this movie a lot . it reminds me most of monsters , inc. -lrb- a movie i absolutely love -rrb- in the way that it combines sweetness and humor in a manner that 's never cloying or annoying . watch it with your kids , watch it with your friends , watch it with your significant other , or watch it by yourself . you 'll laugh , you 'll cheer , you 'll say `` awwww '' , and you 'll fall in love with agnes , edith , and margo even faster than gru does .		8		1
my high rating is for the effect and the comedy . when i seen the mechanic spider , i wonder , how can they do it , it so real and exciting . one of mr smith best movie , the comedy all add up to make this one a must seen film . quite a nice plot and props , like the settings and music .		8		1
'' the little princess '' is a great movie from disney and also one of my favorites from it . ariel , a 16 years old mermaid , is one of the princesses of the sea with her older sisters and her dad , king triton . the only problem is that she is unhappy with her '' under sea life '' , since she always dreamed to live in the human 's world and to have legs to only get worst when ariel starts to fall in love with eric , a beautiful brunet prince that she rescues one day . decided to become a human , she makes a pact with the evil ursula and sells her voice as a payment to be with eric : if after some days , eric kisses her with true love , she can be a human for eternity . but if the opposite happens , she will be ursula 's slave . the only ones who knows her secret besides ursula is sebastian and flounder . i think this movie is very worthwhile . the only thing to mention , is that is loosely based upon the story by hans christian andersen .		8		1
no , this is not citizen kane . it 's just a pleasant little romantic comedy with a business spin , in the realm of baby boom and gung ho . renee zellwegger does a fine job as the fish-out-of-water exec from miami , come to do a hatchet job on a plant in a cold small town in minnesota . harry connick , jr. does very well in a non-musical role as the love interest , and as the representative of the union for a bit of conflict . a capable supporting cast keeps the smiles coming . predictable ? absolutely ! predictable gets a bad rap , actually . as those of us who watch movies more than once -lrb- and there are a lot of us -rrb- must expect predictable , right ? after all , we have seen it before ! corny ? without a doubt ! but corny is not always bad . think of how many corny movies you 've enjoyed . enjoyable ? well , it was for me .		8		1
when he is 8 , john is given a teddy bear for christmas . he wishes for it to come to life so that they could be friends forever , and his wish comes true . skip forward 27 years and , after a brief brush with celebrity , ted is now a dope-smoking foul-mouthed slacker and , still living with john , constantly lures him into this aimless unfocused lifestyle - after all , they are best buddies for ever , right ? lori , john 's girlfriend of four years , has other ideas , however . this film 's one original idea is that one of the central trio of characters is a teddy bear , and to see a teddy bear effing and blinding and smoking a bong is funny . strip away that element -lrb- and cast , say , seth rogen -rrb- and you have a fairly routine rom-com where a long-suffering girl is trying to extract her boyfriend from the clutches of his bad influence best friend . however , the joke is quite a good one and sustains a moderate amount of the length of the film . ted -lrb- voiced by seth macfarlane , who also wrote , directed , and performed capture -rrb- , for all his , remains a fairly endearing character , as do mark wahlberg as the adult john and mila kunis as lori . there is sufficient going on to keep the interest going - silly subplots featuring sam jones ' flash gordon movie , and giovanni ribisi as an unhinged father and would-be toy kidnapper augment the central plot . the realisation of ted is superb . i could have done without quite so much drug use , and a bit less bad language . conversely , i loved the fight between john and ted - vicious , in the way that fights between people who love each other very much yet who are hurting each other a great deal can be , but also very funny , and i also loved patrick stewart 's fairy story narration bookends : absolutely faithful to how such narration is delivered , yet knowingly , wickedly , hilariously subversive .		8		1
i will maintain my same opinion about animations : it is hard to go wrong with an animation . some are better than others sure , but i have yet to see a terrible animation . having said that , `` cars '' is one of the better animations . even though i 'm not a big fan of owen wilson i was able to forget that it was his voice behind lightning mcqueen . cars was a real feel good story with a good message and pretty darn funny as well . mater -lrb- larry the cable guy -rrb- was particularly funny , even though i do n't find his stand-up all that . pixar has found a winning formula , they need only stick with it , and hopefully disney does n't continue to squeeze them .		8		1
since it 's all been said , i just wanted to check in with my comments on ` the passion of joan of arc '' . i saw it recently and i am glad i did so . for all movie lovers , this is a must-see . i will try hard to avoid clichés and corn , as many reviewers have already used the thoughts i wanted to put down - and i am a movie-lover not a movie critic . it is difficult to remain detached from joan as portrayed by ms. falconetti . she gives an extremely sympathetic and powerful performance and draws you to her . you can not watch her face without feeling as she does and this , combined with carl dreyer 's direction creates the illusion of reality and the ` suspension of disbelief ' is complete . i thought the use of close-ups was very effective , as much of the film is comprised of them , particularly the harshness of the faces of her tormentors contrasted with the softness of joan 's . i have seen one other of dreyer 's films , `` days of wrath '' , and felt the same stark realism and authenticity as depicted here . his films are more than character studies , they are in a sense soul studies . `` the passion of joan of arc '' is the depiction of a true-life tragedy brought back to cinematic life by superb filmmaking .		8		1
i 'm not one for loving cheesy films a whole lot . sure i can dig troll 2 for it 's insane cheese , or even blood freak and it 's turkey murderer . i guess i 'm a fan of the genre , but i can tell you i wo n't be paying more than 5 bucks for any of them . so whenever i hear of a movie like mulberry street , i tend to just shrug and see what good can come out of it . mulberry street is a rare breed , it takes a corny premise ... rats infecting people to become killer rat people , but the movie works , surprisingly well . i 'm not gon na get into specifics , because this movie especially , is one you where you should n't pay attention to details . if you let it fly , mulberry street brings you on a consistently entertaining ride . and with this being a low-budget film , movies of this caliber should only be applauded . if you 're looking for a / mutant flick , look no further , mulberry street is easily good enough to satisfy your rat bastard needs .		8		1
in 1811 , in a french occupied germany , the crooks brothers grimm pretend to fight against evil witches and monsters to make money . however , they are arrested by cavaldi -lrb- peter stormare -rrb- and general delatombe -lrb- jonathan pryce -rrb- , but they have a chance to redeem themselves in the village of marbaden , where ten young girls have vanished . will -lrb- matt damon -rrb- and jacob -lrb- heath ledger -rrb- are guided by the local angelika -lrb- lena headey -rrb- through an enchanted forest where they face the evil mirror queen -lrb- monica bellucci -rrb- that depends on the sacrifice of twelve girls in the eclipse to stay beautiful and young . `` the brothers grimm '' is an underrated dark fable , homage to the authors of a great number of fairy tales , the brothers grimm . the first point that calls the attention of this make-believe story is the magnificent cinematography and special effects . the story is original , funny and full of action , but not recommended for children , since it is too dark and gothic . the personalities of will and jacob are not well-defined , since they begin the story as despicable con-men and end like heroes . the screenplay could have developed them further . lena headey and monica bellucci are extremely beautiful , as usual , and they have good performances . i am a fan of terry gilliam and in my opinion the evaluation of his direction in this movie is unfair in many reviews . the high-quality and wonderful pack of the brazilian dvd released by europa distributor deserves a note in my review , being one of the most beautiful i have ever seen . my vote is eight . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` os irmãos grimm '' -lrb- `` the grimm brothers '' -rrb-		8		1
well made with many baseball references that went well over my head but that did n't matter . the film is n't about that , it 's about relationships and as such i found it an engaging watch . both clint eastwood and amy adams were excellent in this ; i admire them both as actors and they did n't disappoint . justin timberlake gets better each time i see him , i just wish he 'd stop making those awful records ! -lrb- it 's a joke folks -rrb- . also worthy of note were matthew lillard as phillip sanderson , robert patrick as vince and john goodman as pete klein . it 's not a tear-jerker or a heart rending tale but i found it did strike an emotional chord with me . if , like me , you admire eastwood and adams then it 's well worth a look . steelmonster 's verdict : recommended my score : 8.1 / 10 . you can find an expanded version of this review on my blog : thoughts of a steelmonster .		8		1
claudette colbert is a knockout who knows it . she wants the good life , which her inventor husband ca n't give her . so she leaves him , intending on marrying someone who can support her and finance his invention . things do n't quite work out . the opening of `` palm beach story '' is a bizarre scene that only makes some sense -lrb- and i 'm emphasizing some -rrb- at the very end of the film . it 's certainly an original way to start a movie . there are some hilarious scenes in this film - desperate to get to palm beach for a quickie divorce , but with no money , colbert accepts the invitation of the gentlemanly ale and quail club to ride in their private train car as their guest and mascot . unfortunately , the emphasis in this club is the ale and not the quail - shooting sugar cubes will do - also blowing out train windows , trashing whole train cars - you get the idea . running from them , colbert soon meets up with rudy vallee , who gives an absolutely delightful performance as a filthy rich man . he serenades her at one point , and it 's great , hearkening back to his days as a crooner ! mary astor is his many times married sister , and when colbert 's husband shows , in the form of joel mccrea , astor sees her next mark . mccrea has a funny slapstick fall down a flight of stairs , but otherwise , does n't have much to do except be angry and jealous of his wife . colbert in her glorious clothes , vallee , and a vivacious astor upstage him a bit . a very funny film , produced during world war ii to give america a much-needed laugh .		8		1
this is a movie that was only a 7 for the first 30 % of the film , a 7.75 for the next 65 % of the film and an 11 for the the last 5 % of the film . doing the math ... . the acting was brilliant as everyone has said . the kid was remarkable - the best kid performance i can ever remember -lrb- casting deserves a lot of credit though , his face is perfect for the required looks -rrb- . the story is interesting and unique . there are a few scares , but mostly just an interesting and tense movie ... until the end . the surprise at the end immediately forces you to rethink the whole movie scene by scene to see if the logic holds up . overall , it does . though there are obvious impossibilities along the way , they are easily dismissed -lrb- retrospectively -rrb- by simply accepting the fact that in the spirit world , not everything operates `` normally '' . so , given that premise , the brilliant ending is both shocking and powerful . so , why not a higher score ? i 'm not a fan of horror pictures . i 'd rather see sci-fi or romantic comedy any day .		8		1
a troubling young man by the name of landon -lrb- shane west -rrb- meets a young woman named jamie -lrb- mandy moore -rrb- . which jamie is the preacher 's daughter , whose self-confidence does n't depend on the opinions of others . which their subsequent relationship , which blossoms to romance and the unexpected tragic consequences that keeps them together . directed by adam shankman -lrb- bringing down the house , the pacifier , the wedding planner -rrb- made a touching , coming of age , romantic drama . this film has an rare spiritual values in this kind of film . west and moore gives credible performances . this film has everything you want in a , hope , goals , faith and unconditional love . dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen -lrb- 2.35:1 -rrb- transfer and an fine-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound . dvd has two feature-length audio commentaries , one by actors : west & moore and director : shankman and the second is by novelist : nicholas sparks -lrb- message in a bottle , the notebook -rrb- & screenwriter : karen janszen -lrb- free willy 2 : the adventure home , digging to china , -rrb- . dvd also has an music video by moore and theatrical trailer . this is a beautiful realize small film . widescreen -lrb- j-d-c scope -rrb- . -lrb- **** / ***** -rrb- .		8		1
this century has brought along dozens of so-called independent movies with famous so-called mainstream actors/actresses as well as bright newcomers in the field of directing , acting and writing . ruby sparks is one of them where stars like annette bening and antonio banderas create a brilliant synergy with e.g. paul dano , whose almost all -lrb- and gifted -rrb- performances are in non-mainstream movies - apart from there will be blood . zoe kazan has created a pleasant romantic comedy-drama , but somehow i did not like her role as title character very much . which is double strange as , in real life , she has been dating her co-star dano for years . being bitch does not really fit her character 's nature . steve coogan has a nice role , and already mentioned bening and banderas are wonderful . but the reason i watched the movie was paul dano - and again , i was not disappointed , on the contrary . he is really talented , definitely in my top10 actors list . recommendable to all fond of romantic movies - as they would never become insipid .		8		1
rico bandello quickly rises thru the gangster ranks , earning himself the nick-name of little caesar . as he sets his sights on the top boss job held by pete montana , rico knows the heat is closing in , fast . tho not the first gangster picture to hit the big screen , little caesar is undeniably one of the genres landmark pictures . adapted from w.r. burnett 's -lcb- high sierra -rcb- al capone inspired novel , little caesar would go on to influence many of the genre highlights that followed this piece . while in the process typecasting its star and icon , edward g. robinson . what is perhaps the first striking thing about viewing the film now is actually just how it is in context to what would follow it , but it never needs to be because this is not just about a violent rising . with the advent of sound proving to be a winner with depression jaded cinema goers , director mervyn leroy exploits this by utilising the fact that it 's set outside of prison walls . the gangster genre by and large up to this point in 1931 consisted of mob characters behind bars , the sight of rico about town amongst the noisy hustle and bustle surely would have opened the eyes and ears of the paying public . i was n't around back then so have no on the spot frame of reference , but the professional critics point to many allegories that reside within little caesar 's structure . talk of paranoia 's and conformity 's during economic collapse , which are for sure points of reference for those so inclined to analyse and dissect caesar as a whole . but to me it 's a gangster picture first and foremost , the rise and fall of a very dubious man with big ideals above his relatively small social standing . rico has ruthless violence constantly itching to burst out , and definite hints of sexual ambiguity make him a worrying , yet most intriguing character . that it works so well obviously is down to edward g. robinson 's portrayal , big bulging eyes and snappy slang phrases -lcb- this themselves must have really hit a chord with the viewers -rcb- , robinson gives the performance that so many have imitated over the years , probably defining the archetype in the process . it does look a little dated now , but that is surely only natural ? , but it 's a powerful film that rises above merely being a hoodlum piece . producer darryl zanuck wanted something different for this burgeoning genre , and with the might of warners revelling in the power of the talkie movie , they all crafted one hell of a picture that enthrals as much as it has influenced , things most definitely changed with little caesar . 8/10		8		1
`` a fistful of dollars '' is widely considered to be the movie that started it all , the rebirth of the western as a legitimate film genre . the man responsible for pioneering the rebirth of the western was not some big hollywood hot-shot , but a young italian filmmaker named sergio leone . `` a fistful of dollars '' was leone 's 1964 western `` update '' -lrb- or remake -rrb- of japanese master filmmaker akira kurosawa 's classic `` yojimbo '' -lrb- 1961 -rrb- . the so-called `` spaghetti westerns '' that leone has claimed credit for helping to jump-start as a legitimate sub-genre of an film genre , is also responsible for launching the career of star clint eastwood ; it seems a shame that he was best-known for the tv show `` rawhide '' in the united states at the time , and that he had to go to europe before people would finally start to take notice of his talents . , leone 's use of wide-angle lenses to capture the oppressive , the close-ups of the actor 's faces -lrb- a trend i believe you could say was later adopted by hong kong and american martial arts films during the '70s -rrb- , gritty realism , and highly stylized depiction of the violent west won fans and critics over during the early 1960s . these films were also responsible for making extensive use of the talents of italian composer ennio morricone . little did they know at that time , however , that `` a fistful of dollars '' was just the beginning . as i stated before , `` a fistful of dollars '' was leone 's update of `` yojimbo , '' about a lone gunslinger , the iconic `` man with no name '' -lrb- eastwood -rrb- , riding into a mexican border town that is in the midst of a gang war between rival factions of smugglers . because the `` man with no name '' -lrb- who is sometimes referred to as `` joe '' in this picture -rrb- holds no solid allegiances to anyone , he decides to play both the mexican rojo gang against the american baxters , with him in the middle - soliciting his services to the highest bidder . `` a fistful of dollars '' is brilliant filmmaking from the word `` go . '' eastwood is undoubtedly the western genre 's most iconic star , and it was his work on this film , its 1965 sequel `` for a few dollars more , '' and the legendary `` the good , the bad and the ugly '' -lrb- 1967 -rrb- that forever cemented his association with the genre - up until eastwood 's oscar-winning anti-western `` unforgiven '' in 1992 . he pretty much pioneered the role of the lone anti-hero in the western movies ; his eyes , laconic way of speaking , cigar hanging out the side of his mouth , quick draw of the gun - yeah , that 's classic clint . clint eastwood has long been one of my favorites of the golden era of hollywood -lrb- he 's my favorite actor overall -rrb- . incredibly enough , while not so much a fan of eastwood 's western pictures , i 've always been partial to his more modern films -lrb- like `` dirty harry '' in 1971 , which is my personal favorite picture of his so far -rrb- . i 'd say that `` unforgiven '' is my favorite western of all time , followed by `` the good , the bad and the ugly . '' `` a fistful of dollars '' = a fistful of dynamite ! 8/10		8		1
back in 1995 , the definitive version of `` pride and prejudice '' was brought out -- and everyone i know who saw that one agrees with me that it is simply the best . much of it is the acting -lrb- having colin firth as darcy is n't bad -rrb- but the biggest reason to adore the made for tv version is that it 's long -- very , very long . this allows the story to unfold slowly and is never rushed . unfortunately , every movie version i 've seen is just too rushed -- and it 's hard to shove this wonderful story into a two-hour time slot . so , no matter how good the 2005 movie is -lrb- and it 's quite good -rrb- , it can not hope to equal the mini-series . it 's a shame , actually , as there 's so much to like about this keira knightly version . the music is great , the locations top-notch and the bennett girls actually look their proper ages ! for example , in the 1940 mgm version , the actual ages of the actresses was their mid-20s to almost 40 ! and , the bennetts are supposed to be teenagers -lrb- there about -rrb- ! my advice is go ahead and watch this 2005 film -- it 's really very lovely . but then do yourself a favor -- find the 1995 version . you 'll be thankful , believe me .		8		1
apart from having the longest reign in british history -lrb- 63 years -rrb- , queen victoria also holds two other distinctions . she was , apart from our current queen , the oldest ever british monarch , living to the age of 81 . and she was also the youngest ever british -lrb- as opposed to english or scottish -rrb- monarch , coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen . and yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her , they seem far more interested in the older victoria than they do in the young girl ; the version of victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is judi dench in `` mrs brown '' . `` the young victoria '' tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign . it has the rare distinction of being produced by a former royal , sarah duchess of york , whose daughter princess beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra . there are three main strands to the plot . the first concerns the intrigues of victoria 's mother , the duchess of kent , a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter , largely because of the influence of her adviser sir john conroy , who was widely rumoured to be her lover . -lrb- according to one unfounded rumour he , and not the late duke of kent , was victoria 's natural father -rrb- . the second strand concerns the growing romance between victoria and her german cousin prince albert , and the attempts of king leopold of belgium , who was uncle to both of them , to influence this romance . -lrb- leopold 's hope was to increase the prestige of the house of , to which both he and albert belonged -rrb- . the third concerns one of the strangest episodes in british political history , the bedchamber crisis of 1839 , when supporters of the tory party -lrb- which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy -rrb- rioted because the young queen was perceived to favour the whig party and their leader lord melbourne , even though the whigs had historically supported a system of government , with the monarch reduced to a figurehead . scriptwriter julian fellowes is known for his conservative views , and at times i wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes , as he seems to lean to the side of the tories , the predecessors of the modern conservative party . their leader robert peel is shown as and dignified , whereas melbourne , for all his dash and charm , is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform . there may be some truth is these characterisations , but fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the tories had opposed the reform act , which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs , and that they had benefited from william iv 's unconstitutional dismissal of a whig administration . lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen , and this one contains its share of inaccuracies . prince albert , for example , was not injured in edward oxford 's attempt on victoria 's life , and melbourne -lrb- in his late fifties at the time of victoria 's accession -rrb- was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by paul bettany . king william iv certainly disliked the duchess of kent -lrb- who was his sister-in-law -rrb- , but i doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet , as he is shown doing here . i also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the duchess and conroy try to force victoria to sign a `` regency order '' ; the duchess 's constitutional position was made clear by the regency act 1830 , which provided that she would become regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession . no piece of paper signed by victoria could have altered the provisions of the act . there are also occasional infelicities . in one early scene we see victoria and albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard , a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a `` danger ! major cliché ahead ! '' warning . yet in spite of scenes like this , i came to enjoy the film . there were some good performances , especially from miranda richardson as the scheming duchess and mark strong as the obnoxious conroy . it is visually very attractive , being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with british historical drama . jim broadbent gives an amusing turn as king william , although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top . -lrb- although not as disastrously over the top as he was in `` moulin rouge '' -rrb- . the main reason for the film 's success , however , is the performances of emily blunt and rupert friend as the two young lovers victoria and albert . blunt is probably more attractive than victoria was in real life , but in her delightful portrayal the queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination , the black-clad widow of windsor who was perpetually not amused , but a determined , strong-minded and loving young woman . her love for albert , and their happy family life together , was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the british people . -lrb- with the exception of george iii , victoria 's ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues -rrb- . blunt and friend make `` the young victoria '' a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in british history . 8/10		8		1
this is the 2nd best installment in this franchise so far , unless `` die hard 6 '' pulls something out of this world . it 's exciting and fast paced all around . sure it 's probably the most implausible `` die hard '' movie out of all of them which is saying something . but the thing is , it 's still entertaining . and it did n't get to the point where it got annoying or irritating to watch and that includes the random coincidences throughout this flick . bruce willis is back as john mcclane and he still has all that characteristics john mcclane . who is this tough smartass that taunts his enemies no matter what situation he is in and is a badass while doing what he does best . and this time around he has a real partner , not really a sidekick but a partner . who goes by the name of zeus carver and is played by samuel l. jackson . who is a black version of mcclane but is n't as physical but still more patient and to a degree more intellectual . and he is a badass as well . and it was cool to see them go around new york city `` grand theft auto '' style trying to save innocent civilians from bombs and take down the bad guys . the main villain this time is simon -lrb- jeremy irons -rrb- and he is just great in this role . in fact he is probably the 2nd best villain so far in this franchise . he is like the the riddler from btas and bane from `` the dark knight rises '' . well not the complete package from both of those villains but a little of both . in fact it would have been cool if the ending went in a different direction . the way one of the writers decided to end the movie . so maybe they could have picked it back up in `` die hard 5 '' . this is directed by the same director that directed the first `` die hard '' which is why a lot of the elements that made the first `` die hard '' awesome is still intact . overall if your a action movie fan this is a one that is really worth seeing . 8/10		8		1
6.8 imdb rating puts this among some of the worst early bonds which is totally not true . obviously when this was released audiences were disappointed that connery had not reprised the role , and now people rate it poorly because they do not recognise lazenby as a well known bond there is a lot to like about ohmss though , it has a distinctly modern feel about it compared to many of the bond movies that came after , for example a majority of the skiing shots are real and very good , the lighting is excellent and even tricky effects like the part where one of bond 's pursuers falls over the cliff look pretty bloody good lazenby 's bond is low tech and tough , sound familiar ? very much like our modern day bond , daniel craig . . some of the scenes in this movie are very similar to casino royale actually including the beach intro . the fight scenes are very close and tightly choreographed it also has kojak -lrb- telly savalas -rrb- in it who in my opinion was the best blofeld . it also has joanna lumley and the very beautiful diana rigg -lrb- emma peel , the avengers -rrb- , who is probably the best and classiest bond girl ever the movie is a hidden gem among the bond catalogue and it is rated by many hardcore bond fans as the best of the lot . one wonders what might have been had lazenby continued in the role . instead we got diamonds are forever and then roger . . it is certainly amongst my top 5 bonds -lrb- alongside dr no , the spy who loved me , goldeneye and casino royale -rrb- . highly recommended		8		1
another non-stop action hit with jason statham . his name alone equals adrenaline-filled and action . and `` the mechanic '' is no exception . action from start till end . the storyline in `` the mechanic '' is very interesting and you quickly get swept up in it and the story keeps you nailed to the seat until the movie ends . there is n't a lot of twists and surprises , but still , the movie managed to come out with a rather good end result . on the cast list are names like jason statham -lrb- playing arthur bishop -rrb- duh ! and he really is in his ace in a movie like this . donald sutherland -lrb- playing harry mckenna -rrb- also had a role in the movie , although a fairly small role . i think it was a shame that sutherland did n't have a longer role and more screen time in this movie . tony goldwyn -lrb- playing dean -rrb- was really well cast for this particular role ; there is just something scheming and secretive about him . ben foster -lrb- playing steve mckenna -rrb- also did a really good job with his role . and it was a treat to see jeff chase -lrb- playing burke -rrb- in the role that he had . the movie is filled with action , fighting , speed and thrills from the beginning and up till the very end . and this is what we have come to expect when we see jason statham 's name billed on a movie poster or cover . `` the mechanic '' is a movie that has enough value to be watched more than once , and i do believe that i will be making another return to it sometime down the line .		8		1
it has inspired many new movies like : tomb raider mummy ... . . but none are as good as this one . good but i still think that there are better action films than this . i think that this film is funny and there are much action in it rating : 4,5 out of 5		8		1
i found this movie to be enjoyable enough : even when it is true that it was n't at the same level than some of previous pixar films -lrb- such as `` toy story '' and `` the incredibles '' -rrb- it was a good film anyway , with an entertaining story and likable characters . despite the strangeness of the premise of a world inhabited by living cars , the execution is fairly convincing , with a neat character development and many funny and heartwarming moments . without being perfect , it managed to be something totally worth-watching from beginning to end , and in many ways this could be easily considered one of the best animated films from the year 2006 -lrb- which was a terrible year , in my opinion -rrb- 7.5 / 10		8		1
these two tales of horror are inspired by the work of edgar allan poe . the two tales are titled `` the facts in the case of mr. valdemar '' and `` the black cat '' . `` the facts in the case of mr. valdemar '' is written and directed by george a. romero -lrb- bruiser , the dark half -rrb- . `` the black cat '' is directed by dario argento -lrb- the stendhal syndrome , trauma -rrb- . `` the facts in the case of mr. valdemar '' . the story is about a conniving wife -lrb- adrienne barbeau -rrb- and her lover -lrb- ramy zada -rrb- use a hypnotic trance to embezzle a fortune from her dying husband -lrb- bingo o'malley -rrb- . his wife and her lover are receiving surprises messages from the behind the grave , when her husband died unexpectedly . `` the black cat '' . the story is about a talented but unfocused photographer -lrb- harvey keitel -rrb- is driven into madness , when his girlfriend 's -lrb- madeleine potter -rrb- new pet . this man is driven to brutal acts of crimes and murder . romero 's take on `` the facts in the case of mr. valdemar '' is a mix of high camp , heavy handed and some real silliness but what it makes it watchable is the good performances by the three leads : barbeau , zada and o'malley . e.g. marshall has a small role . romero 's wife : christine forrest and tom atkins appears in cameos . argento 's take on `` the black cat '' is near perfect . harvey keitel gives a powerful performance and this one hour film is a study of obsession . the only fault is the shortcoming conclusion . this story has a good cast like sally kirkland , martin balsam , john amos and kim hunter . this is one of argento 's best works as a director . written by the director and franco ferrini -lrb- demons -rrb- . blue underground did an excellent job of doing an newly transferred from an original vault negative on this two-disc set . also the sound is been remastered to dolby digital 5.1 ex surround sound -lrb- also in dts 6.1 es surround sound -rrb- . the dvd has the original theatrical trailer , poster & still gallery and talent bios . the film features grisly terrific make-up effects by tom savini and great music score by pino donaggio -lrb- carrie , dressed to kill , the howling -rrb- . disc two has an entertaining featurette with interviews by romero , argento , savini and vintage interview with an young 14 year-old asia argento . second disc also has 12 minute featurette with savini about the f/x work , other savini featurette showing parts of his house back in the late 1980 's and an outtake from `` document of the dead '' with interview with actress barbeau . this independent production was briefly released into theaters in the u.s but become a wild horror hit in europe . this is a cult film . i would really love to see dario argento 's take on `` the black cat '' as a full length two hour film . imagine what would argento could have done with that . george a. romero 's `` the facts in the case of mr. valdemar '' rates -lrb- *** 1/2 / ***** -rrb- . and dario argento 's `` the black cat '' rates -lrb- **** 1/2 / ***** -rrb- . both films rates together -lrb- **** / ***** -rrb- . do not miss this forgotten horror stories done by two talented directors .		8		1
regardless of how faithful the spiderwick chronicles movie is to the original stories by tony diterlizzi and holly black , the film is tremendously entertaining and thankfully resolute . unlike the recent flock of fantasy epics including the golden compass and the seeker , which conclude feeling wholly unsatisfactory due to an abrupt resolution that suggests further films in the series , the spiderwick chronicles easily stands alone as a complete story . with sensationally mirthful creature designs and likable human characters , topped with state-of-the-art special effects , the spiderwick chronicles is another big win for paramount and a high bar for family films of 2008 . the moment the grace family moves into the dilapidated spiderwick estate , strange things begin to happen . jared -lrb- freddie highmore -rrb- is a curious , adventurous boy who quickly seeks out the hidden remains of great great uncle arthur spiderwick 's laboratory . he unleashes a mysterious force when he locates a field guide full of the secrets of the magical creatures that inhabit the forest surrounding the mansion . his twin brother simon is calm and reserved and very much the intellectual one , but is rapidly drawn into the fantastical world of faeries and goblins . older sister mallory and their mom are harder to convince , but after the almighty and ruthless ogre leader mulgarath -lrb- nick nolte -rrb- begins to attack the home , everyone must band together to combat the hordes of goblins and creatures that lurk outside . the spiderwick chronicles is , on the surface , an alluringly delightful fantasy that blends the very best of character designs , both human and cg , into a story that effortlessly engrosses without stumbling out of the realm of suspended disbelief . everything within the story makes sense as it unfolds , and we do n't question why certain things are feasible -- because as the world of goblins and is defined , we have no reason not to become completely immersed in the fantasy . director mark waters does n't rush the process of illustrating the multitude of magic and myths , and does n't overload us with jargon that we could n't possibly comprehend . the pacing is fantastic for a family film , and does n't fall into the three hour trap that the lord of the rings sets . the children have more appeal and charismatic personalities than those of the narnia kids , and the creatures are more lovable and than those in harry potter . each computer animated monstrosity and cuddly ally beautifully blend into the forested environment , and never reach a level of utter annoyance . the designs themselves are ingenious , with a mix of gelatinous abominations like , the angry henchman goblin , a furry old man -lrb- thimbletack , voiced by martin short -rrb- who speaks in rhyme , and a mighty griffin that soars above the picturesque clouds . eloquently wispy faeries and an enormous horned ogre are also substantial parts of the spiderwick mythology , and many other exciting creatures frequent this action-filled fairyland . the spiderwick chronicles undeniably makes fantasy and magic fun . while a few scenes of unnecessary predicaments involving the children 's divorced parents could have been cut , the film manages not to be overly preachy , even with its many positive messages and abounding morals . with pleasing characters , family-friendly magical adventure and a mind-bogglingly fantastical world of faeries , goblins and ogres , the spiderwick chronicles is extraordinarily entertaining fantasy fun . - the massie twins		8		1
battle royale may seem like some serial killers favorite dream , the plausibility of such an event is not too far-fetched . while the film took a rather extreme stance on what to do with nagging problems of discipline and apathy , the very idea of using violence to solve these problems seems rather realistic . it 's amazing the book this film was based off of was n't made by an american . frankly , i 'm ashamed as an american that we could n't come up with something so feral and nihilistic . are all of the daily dosages of violence and havoc not helping us ? have we lost our edge ? well , on a more serious note , br was certainly something that opened my eyes . while the budget could have been better in order to add some more realism to the violence , the underlying message leads one to wonder just how far off these assumptions are . while we tend to believe that mankind could never do this to anyone , one needs to look no further than the wars , genocide and evil we partake in every day . but what really makes battle royale a disturbing film is the rather candid nature of the characters . while the shell shocked people were quite realistic , it did n't seem too implausible that adrenaline junkies like kiriyama would enter in these contests just to experience the thrill of killing someone . either way , i regard this as a piece of fiction , but like all texts that deal with the decay of society , this feels vaguely familiar .		8		1
it was quite suspenseful and beautifully shot but i figured out the plot twist from the moment the illusionist -lrb- played by edward norton -rrb- enlightened the crown prince -lrb- played by the always delightfully sinister rufus sewell -rrb- with the `` soul lives on '' trick . maybe it 's because i had seen the prestige before this , i do n't know but i figured out the ending way ahead of time and that kind of ruined the rest of it all for me . the story within the film is that of a young man with the talent for magic , who falls in love with a beautiful countess -lrb- jessica biel -rrb- and the obstacles they face with their star-crossed love . one of the best performances in the film , comes from paul giametti who plays a police inspector whom at the bequest of the crown prince is hot on the tail of the illusionist . his job is to try and discredit the young magician and defame him because he is not only a rival to the prince but is also able to command such a strong attention of the country 's people -lrb- something the crown prince is wary of -rrb- . when the death of sophie -lrb- biel -rrb- rouses suspicion , a game of cat and mouse ensues in the quest to figure out whether the illusionist can reveal her killer . but be mindful of everything you see during the course of the film , as a key clue to the ending plays out within thirty minutes into the film .		8		1
`` death rides a horse '' aka `` as man to man '' -lrb- 1967 -rrb- , directed by giulio petroni , is among the best spaghetti westerns . leen , mean and with with plenty of action , it never slows down from the brilliantly executed murder and rape during a that sets in motion bill meceita -lrb- john phillip law -rrb- trail of bloody vengeance . of course the real star of this film is lee van cleef . and savage , this master thespian can easily hold his own against scowling villains one-eye -lrb- mario brega -rrb- or walcott -lrb- luigi pistilli -rrb- . the photography is fine and the screenplay by luciano vincenzoni is a mini-masterpiece of . but now , the vices . quite a few shots of `` canyons '' seem to have been filmed in quarry 's , some of the supporting cast are weak , notably carlo and josé torres . also , the one real weakness that detracts from this otherwise great movie is when , each time bill sees someone who was involved in killing his father , there is a quick , red tinted flash-back showing what evil crime they had committed against his family . as there are five people to kill , this soon becomes rather monotonous . apart from the few flaws mentioned , this is a almost perfect example of a normal spaghetti western . a sheer joy to watch .		8		1
okay , i am not a huge nemo fan , but considering the film 's modest pretenses and how much kids loved it , who am i to complain -- especially since the animation is so nice ? plus , the film is much , much better than the knock-off film , shark tale . the film has one of the simplest plots i have ever seen in a kids movie . nemo loves his dad and vice-versa . when nemo is captured for a home aquarium , the timid dad springs to the rescue with rather predictable results . there are no major surprises but the journey along the way is pleasant and cute . the kids will no doubt love it but some parents may find it a bit `` sticky '' and shallow like i did . but considering how much fun my daughter had watching it , this can all be forgiven .		8		1
italian writer/director dario argento lives up to his fame with this thrilling mystery tenebre , meaning darkness or shadows . anthony franciosa plays american novelist peter neal , who travels to rome to promote his latest best seller . almost immediately a killer has the writer under surveillance and is shocking rome mimicking the gruesome murders from neal 's book tenebre . is it publicity for the popular novel or is there really a killer targeting perverted souls ? if you get weak at the sight of blood this is not for you . it splatters , drips , spews and flows copiously . and a very interesting twist finale you will not expect . also in the cast : daria nicolodi , john saxon , christian borromeo , john steiner and lara wendel .		8		1
after a car accident where the first lady dies , the secret service special agent mike banning -lrb- gerard butler -rrb- is disgraced and transferred to the bureaucratic service . when the white house is under a terrorist attack , president benjamin asher -lrb- aaron eckhart -rrb- is kidnapped by the terrorist kang -lrb- rick yune -rrb- and banning breaks in the place . now he needs to save the president 's son that is chased by the terrorists that wants to use the child to force asher to give the access code to a powerful weapon and then to rescue the president from kang . `` olympus has fallen '' is a great action movie with good story and direction and top-notch cast . the plot is tense and holds the attention of the viewer until the very end despite the stupidity of the american president that orders his collaborators to give their secret codes to the enemy . the trailer shows practically the storyline . my vote is eight . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` à casa '' -lrb- `` invasion to the white house '' -rrb-		8		1
george lucas declared that this film was an inspiration for star wars . the similarities are very obvious . there is a hero , actually a general undercover , and two bumbling fools that stumble upon the hidden fortress in the title . you can consider these two fools to be the robots in star wars . they certainly provide a lot of laughs . they are constantly being fooled as they help the general . the fools , played brilliantly by minoru chiaki and kamatari fujiwara do manage to survive at the end and walk off together as friends . they are the most interesting part of akira kurosawa 's film that relies more on characters than most of his other samurai pictures . of course , there is the pleasure of seeing toshiro mifune as general rokurota makabe , whose mission it is to save the princess , no , not leia , but princess yuki -lrb- misa uehara -rrb- , who has the same spirit that lucas used in princess leia . the rebel forces are , of course , fooled and the princess and the gold they are carrying gets to a friendly province . another fantastic adventure by kurosawa and mifune .		8		1
now after the whatevers and the fashion statements are imbedded in your head , the movie turns out to be funny and super . maybe there are kids that act like that , but who knows ? i live in wisconsin ... but anyways -lrb- ** spoiler ** -rrb- the guy that turns out to be homosexual that cher is trying to hook up with was cute as a button , and why on earth didnt cher just get with the guy that she was trying to hook tai up with ? but oh well , it makes the movie interesting and wanting to know what happened to her and dionne and all the rest . the movie eventually gets to a moral which i found rather important , it doesnt matter what your clothes look like or how you wear your hair , but you can all just get along , even in beverly hills . -lrb- a a - -rrb-		8		1
invictus is a movie i avoided for a while due to the uninteresting subject matter that was at hand for me . i am well aware of nelson mandella 's accomplishments , and what he did , but in reality he did n't interest me all that much . rugby is also a sport i detest because i get bored easily from it . invictus surprised me by keeping me involved with its story , and despite the long running time , i was never bored during any of it . invictus deserves praise for giving us a very good story , but it is matt damon and morgan freeman who deserve real kudos . morgan freeman 's mannerisms and impersonation of nelson was simply uncanny , and i really felt he pulled it off beautifully . clint eastwood 's direction is also on the ball as usual . he directs with a certain flair and tenacity during the rugby scenes . nothing overly intense , but very effective and impressive for my liking . the only thing that bothered me was that despite the feel-good ending , the rugby team did not win that way . performances . morgan freeman is brilliant as mandella . he has mannerisms down to a t , and i truly felt he was nelson mandella . is he oscar worthy ? not quite , but he is still very , very good . matt damon is equally as impressive as francois . his accent is a bit inconsistent , but i admired his intensity and all business attitude . he was engrossing to watch . bottom line . invictus is n't the oscar epic it so desperately wanted to be . however it is still an interesting movie that i recommend quite highly . 8/10		8		1
film versions of tennessee williams great plays can be a little frustrating , especially for those of us lucky enough to have seen a fine production of the play on stage . i saw a fine production of this piece in london in 1999 , with sheila gish as mrs venable , rachel weisz as catherine and gerard butler as doctor cukrowicz . but this film version is actually extremely good . the cast more or less speaks for itself . katherine hepburn is not quite as repulsive as i imagine mrs venable to have become , but this is a movie version after all and somehow katherine hepburn seemed to become increasingly ghastly as the movie goes on - strong work on her part and the director 's part i should n't wonder . taylor and clift are predictably good . most tennessee william 's plays had their endings tampered with for hollywood and this piece is no exception . however , there is only a subtle difference between the ending of the film and the ending of the play , unlike the cringe-inducing changes to some -lrb- `` streetcar '' and `` cat '' being the main offenders -rrb- . this is not william 's best-known piece , but it is one of my favourites and this film version also slots in right up there with the very , very best . well worth seeing , is this .		8		1
i have heard of the movie rashomon for many years , but only now got around to seeing it . i expected some samurai war movie , so i had previously avoided it . it might be described as a fairy tale . it is told in a slow paced , repetitive way . if found myself wanting the long shots to end , not because they were boring , but because they built to uncomfortable intensity . i was was not prepared for the mifune character . i had seen him previously , but only much older . he was indescribably sexy , with an athletic lithe body , and sculpted face , and oddly innocent . an astrologer would peg him as an archetypical aries . yet at the same time he was repulsive , completely selfish , a rapist , with a hideous laugh , and a habit of jumping at people , like he were trying to get some mice in a tank to flinch . he really plays with you -- push pull . the scene that stabbed me most was when the wife told her husband she had never loved him , that she had just pretended to , and she had hoped for someone like the bandit to rescue her whom she planned to run off with . she would not mind at all if the bandit killed her husband . this echoed a melodramatic scene from my own life that knocked me for a loop for decades , so it really punched . you hear the story via the bandit , the wife , the husband 's ghost and the woodcutter . just what happened becomes quite a blur . i knew certain elements of the story could n't be true , but i could not piece together a definitive version . it is also quite hard to figure out the motive for the various lies . this movie will keep people puzzling for decades to come .		8		1
san fransisco socialite melanie daniels meets lawyer mitch brenner in a pet store and there is an instant mutual attraction . she follows him to his family home in the small fishing village of bodega bay , but suddenly and inexplicably large flocks of birds start to attack the townspeople . confused and frightened , melanie , mitch and his family board up the house and try to fend off this mysterious threat . everything about the birds is genius ; it 's one of hitchcock 's greatest films , one of the very best scary movies ever made and has a unique position in horror cinema . if night of the living dead represents the birth of modern horror -lrb- and it does -rrb- , then if there 's one film it owes a debt to , it 's the birds ; unexplained threat , realistic setting , nice people get killed , nervous breakdowns , impotent hero , besieged farmhouse , unresolved ending . as well as thematically , it also set many trends visually - measured tracking shots -lrb- melanie delivering the lovebirds -rrb- , clever use of sound and visual effects -lrb- the attack on the school -rrb- , sudden shock moments -lrb- lydia discovering the farmer 's corpse -rrb- - watch any of the great horror films of the last forty years -lrb- the exorcist , halloween , the evil dead -rrb- and you will see these motifs refashioned countless times . at the age of 62 , hitchcock embraced new techniques and technology to make his one true horror film and turned in a masterpiece . what makes it so good for me is the mixture of the peerless style with the intriguing story and characterisation . people tend to remember the last half-hour of the film very well but forget that the entire first half is just all character development ; we learn about melanie 's wayward past , mitch and annie 's history together and lydia 's fears . the performances are all smooth and naturalistic , with tandy and pleshette both outstanding , and it 's purely because we know and understand these people so well that the subsequent horrors have such an impact on us . the support players in the diner are fun too , notably griffies as the gruff ornithologist and lang as the panicking mother , and thirteen-year-old cartwright - a future horror icon from invasion of the body snatchers and alien - is wonderful as the terrified kid sister . the script by evan hunter -lrb- aka crime novelist ed mcbain -rrb- , based on a great old story by daphne dumaurier , keeps reversing movie clichés - the characters are n't dumb but they panic , react wrongly , waste time and snipe at each other . tandy is a textbook example of good acting enriching a horror film ; watch the standard scene where the hero is reporting what happened to a cop and hitchcock completely ignores them and chooses to follow tandy around the room instead as she picks up broken crockery and tries -lrb- and fails -rrb- to restore normality to her life . the masterstroke is the revolutionary open ending -lrb- note that the traditional the end title does not appear -rrb- with our heroes driving off through an endless vista of watchful birds to an uncertain future . the horror never ends . on a visual level too , the film is quite wonderful . at this point , cameraman robert burks had made ten films with hitch and editor george tomasini seven , so they were in perfect accord . burks ' photography is outstanding both in technical terms since there are lots of complicated effects sequences -lrb- my favourite is the scene -rrb- and also the amazing faked location photography . some of the film was shot in the real bodega bay on the county border but most of it was n't , yet it all appears to take place there . take the scene where melanie and mitch drink wine on a bluff above the children 's party ; only the opening and closing shots are real - the rest is a studio but you have to really watch to pick these up . even better though is burks ' eye for an unusual atmospheric shot - a profile of pleshette reclining in a chair and smoking , the broken cups still hanging on their hooks , the tearing down the panic-stricken street , the bird beaks picking away at the front door unseen , countless others . combine this with tomasini 's brilliant editing -lrb- the birds amassing behind melanie on the school 's is just the best -rrb- and breathtaking work by ub iwerks and albert whitlock and you have a film with an almost perfect technical pedigree . the final stroke of genius is the wild soundtrack , which features no music , only dialogue , effects and the ultra-creepy electronic of the birds . music does many things in films but one thing it does is provide a cathartic release - hitch daringly took it all out -lrb- has any other mainstream film tried that since ? -rrb- leaving us with nothing to do but scream . if you 're ever tempted to think that alfred hitchcock is overrated as a filmmaker , give yourself a slap and then watch this movie . it 's that rare bird -lrb- sic -rrb- ; a hugely entertaining , amazingly original , brilliantly constructed , technically dazzling , atmospheric masterpiece .		8		1
a single man is based on the acclaimed novel by christopher isherwood and directed by fashion designer tom a beautiful score by abel korzeniowski and equally beautiful photography by eduard grau the highlight of the film is without a doubt colin the heartbroken man who struggles to maintain his facade of perfection in 60 's america after suffering a devastating personal scene where he receives a phone call to tell him about the accident which claimed his partners life is a masterclass of acting , beginning shocked but still controlled and ending as a man in bits . america 1962 and british english professor george falconer -lrb- colin firth -rrb- is struggling to maintain his perfectly crafted facade after the death of his partner jim -lrb- matthew goode -rrb- in a car the course of one day george teaches a class , receives advances from one of his pupil 's kenny -lrb- nicholas hoult -rrb- and has a party with his boozy best friend charlie -lrb- a wonderful julianne moore -rrb- all the while planning his suicide . any worries there might have been about a fashion designer turned first time director , faded away on release as ford proved his talents did n't just lie in the fashion fine look at grief and loss that 's deeply moving and mesmerising . the film looks good enough to eat and the visuals are interesting with ford and grau using colour saturation to great effect -lrb- they even manage to make smog look gorgeous -rrb- . george and others are shot in colour but there is a dullness to the quality to signify people going through the when george has an experience that makes him happy be it a memory or an encounter his face brightens up -lrb- granted it 's not very subtle but it 's very effective -rrb- . the performances are brilliant especially colin and julianne and it 's a film that makes you think and feel in equal measure .		8		1
well , in reality , i suspect the story behind buffalo soldiers has picked up a bit of embellishment along the way from modern folklore to big screen , but that 's hardly surprising . what is surprising is that such a basic story can be turned into such a funny film . it 's not so much ha-ha funny as it is just ironic funny . indeed , the story about one woman screaming protests about the so-called anti-american sentiment of the film and flinging a bottle at the screen tells me that some people still expect their comedy to be spoonfed to them . if anything , this film reads like a celebration of the things that the citizens of western societies take for granted . with soldiers situated far from home , and having nothing better to do than play games of indoor gridiron at times , it 's a small wonder that soldiers turn to drug abuse or other such illegal activity in order to stave off boredom . stir craziness is a problem in any army during peacetime , although one ca n't help but wonder if we 're not being shown a rather extreme example here . the basis of this black comedy is in the solid performances of the principal cast . joaquin phoenix shows once again that he has a great talent , while ed harris and scott glenn do an admirable job of playing the straight arrows . but it is another moderated type of performance from the ever-wonderful anna paquin that at least kept this viewer engaged . this woman could make a ninety minute film in which she reads the telephone book , and i 'd probably enjoy it . the corruption shown in this film is hardly surprising , given how little soldiers seem to be paid in comparison to the stress they endure . if there is indeed any truth to the of drug abuse , then it 's not surprising anymore that employers are currently employing random drug testing . dr. strangelove could n't get more spot-on about how the human element of the military is generally its undoing . after one memorable sequence involving drugged tank drivers , i 'll never be able to catch sight of an army vehicle without getting the urge to run away , screaming . i gave buffalo soldiers an eight out of ten . under normal circumstances , i would have given it a seven , but it has anna paquin in it , and any film with anna paquin in it can earn a bonus point . if you like your comedy without obvious prompts of when you 're meant to laugh , then you ca n't go wrong with buffalo soldiers .		8		1
`` cat on a hot tin roof '' is an adaptation of tennesse williams ' pulitzer prize winning play of the same name . williams focused his play on attitudes toward homosexuality and cynical depiction of a dysfunctional southern american family . the film nicely depicted the home of the family , a vast mississippi plantation , from outside and in . the head of the family , the imposing big daddy , stands out in the film because of the engaging performance of burl ives . ives portrays a confrontational and crass yet uneasy big daddy to perfection . paul newman and elizabeth taylor were an appropriate pair to portray the friction between brick and maggie . the supporting cast also does well in providing the annoyances surrounding the three main characters . the censorship imposed on this film keeps it from reaching its full potential . while the confrontations between big daddy and brick are memorable , with brick speaking of the `` mendacity '' surrounding him and big daddy lamenting his plight , a lot was lost from the original play . the potentially homosexual brick of williams ' play was replaced by a brick that needs to grow up , causing the film to lose the full of the potency of the play . despite the censorship , the film is still worth seeing for the memorable performances . however , the censorship keeps this film from being a classic on par with `` a streetcar named desire '' -lrb- 1951 -rrb- .		8		1
`` stay scared '' is a line mike enslin -lrb- john cusack -rrb- repeats a few times throughout this movie . it does n't only apply to the people he talks to , but is also a message from director mikael håfström to the audience , one it will be hard not to pay attention to : 1408 , based on a short story by stephen king , is one of the scariest films in recent years -lrb- even more remarkable if you take into account that it 's rated pg-13 -rrb- , and arguably the first good adaptation of the horror master 's work since the green mile . as is often the case with king , the protagonist is a writer : more precisely , enslin specializes in finding `` haunted '' buildings and spending the night in those places , proving there is no such thing as ghosts or any other supernatural forces . one day he receives a postcard which persuades him to go to a glamorous new york hotel and ask to be given the titular room . the hotel manager , played by samuel l. jackson , tries to convince him it is a crazy choice , given 56 people have died in that room over the course of 95 years , and when asked what exactly caused those deaths he sums it up with a short , chilling sentence : `` it 's an evil f * cking room . '' . nonetheless , enslin decides to stay in 1408 , believing all the warnings he has received are merely publicity stunts . but once things start appearing and disappearing , the door gets permanently locked and a watch starts counting down from 60 minutes -lrb- the time-frame within which every previous guest died -rrb- , the cynical author begins to believe he might actually have entered a room that embodies pure evil . no one has ever lasted more than one hour in 1408 , we are told at the beginning . ironically , that is also how long it takes before the movie starts showing small signs of weakness , mostly plot-related : as long as he relies on psychological tension and thrills deriving from everyday objects , like kubrick did with the shining , håfström has everything under control ; it is when he gets to the third act and needs to come up with a satisfying solution that he slightly disappoints , the surreal mid-film twist being way too far-fetched even for a king story -lrb- the creepy epilogue , however , is just about enough to forgive that misstep -rrb- . less forgivable is the choice of the supporting actors in what is essentially a one-man show : jackson , who appears in two scenes , manages to be terrific in the first -lrb- see paragraph 2 -rrb- and border on the ridiculous in the second , while there is no logical explanation for why a fine character actor like tony shalhoub accepted to do a 30-second cameo which adds absolutely nothing of value to the film . only mary mccormack , playing mrs. enslin , is able to partially match the painful intensity that emanates from cusack . which brings us to the real reason to watch this movie : having not appeared in anything of relevance since 2003 's runaway jury -lrb- where he still ended up playing second fiddle to gene hackman and dustin hoffman -rrb- , the grifters star is finally given the chance to really sink his teeth into quality material , and he turns out to be genuinely shocking in his second king-based role -lrb- he previously played gordie lachance 's dead brother in stand by me -rrb- . the most gratifying aspect of his performance is the fact he does n't show symptoms of mad despair immediately : it worked for jack nicholson in the shining , but that was nicholson ; cusack , who has always gone for a subtler approach to his roles , lets the panic out gradually , making his crazier antics in the picture 's second half more believable . the same goes for the back-story : normally , a character 's tragic past is thrown in right away to make the audience feel sorry , although it generally causes the opposite effect ; this movie 's three screenwriters , on the other hand , unveil the dramatic subplot slowly , bit by bit , so that by the time it is tied to present events it is actually possible to care for the people involved . a great premise , consistent suspense and a mesmerizing central performance : those are three valid reasons why lovers of the horror genre should watch 1408 . dodgy `` twist '' toward the end and largely irrelevant secondary cast aside , this film has enough assets to ensure king fans will , to paraphrase mike enslin , stay scared .		8		1
the deaf and dumb teenager dot -lrb- camilla belle -rrb- is adopted by the deer family after the death of her father in an accident , and her seventeen year-old stepsister nina -lrb- elisha cuthbert -rrb- gives a cold treatment to her , humiliating dot in the high-school and at home . nina 's mother olivia -lrb- edie falco -rrb- , who is addicted in pills , was a close friend of dot 's mother and her husband paul -lrb- martin donovan -rrb- is a successful architect . while living with the deers , the invisible nina discovers that they are actually a dysfunctional family with a dark secret that approaches her to nina that also has discovered that dot has a hidden secret . the classy and erotic `` the quiet '' was a great surprise for me , with a dense and solid drama about an unpleasant theme -- incest -- that is unusual in american movies . camilla belle , elisha cuthbert , martin donovan and edie falco give top-notch performances , and the talented actress and pianist camilla belle is responsible for part of the stylish music score , playing beethoven on the piano . the powerful story about invisibility and secrets may be controversial or polemic for many viewers , disturbing for others , but never disappointing . my vote is eight . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` o do '' -lrb- `` the price of the silence '' -rrb-		8		1
welcome back kiefer sutherland . it 's been too long since you 've appeared in a movie , , and what a movie this was , was it 24 no , , but very intriguing , especially with a pro like michael douglas in the lead as the embattled secret service agent . kiefer 's character is the one chasing michael douglas the whole movie , , kiefer 's partner , , is eva longoria , , the desperate . wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good , , i wish though that kim bassinger had a bigger role , , but other than that , i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish . this movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller , everybody played their part to the hilt . nothing was revealed to in the movie , , so as to keep you guessing at all times . and i really think that kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie , , but in my opinion michael douglas had the performance of the day , , thumbs up .		8		1
if renee zelweger were any cuter , i think world peace might be possible after all . but it 's her character in this romantic comedy that ... will get you hooked . new in town is surprisingly funny story of adjusting and falling in love with more than just a person . anybody who 's ever lived in small towns would find it nostalgic and dead on . i like the story . granted it 's not oscar worthy material but be that as it may , i did n't expect it to be so engaging and easy to relate to . it does n't have any of those cheesy over the top jokes that only the filmmaker and the crew would enjoy but instead , it carries simple sense of humor that will get you at least to chuckle , funny things at the cost of the winter cold for example , or at the cost of getting lost in the accent , or the huge difference in ways of thinking and doing things between a city girl and a country girl . renee zelweeger is radiant , full of energy , even when her character seems to get beat down , she manages to capture our attention only because she has the charm of a leading lady . she has excellent comedic timing which is not anything new , keeping in mind that she 's tackled drama-comedy successfully in the past . anytime that she tries to attempt something out of her comfort zone , that 's when you can expect hilarity to show up . it 's clear to see that everybody involved in this project did not have the desire to try too hard to make this movie more than what it is . the plot line tells 's character dealing with the new place within the one year that she was there and i appreciate it 's not done in a way that sex and the city movie had its one year story which felt a bit slow . actor j.k. simmons is under-appreciated , his performance as the wise-cracking stu is proof that it 's only a matter of time before this man gets nominated in the near future . new in town will arouse your curiosity to get out of your comfort zone and try new places , setting , and habits . -- rama 's screen --		8		1
easily one of the best films in the last several years . just one hell of a ride . michael mann is great . the basic plot of the film finds a cab driver , max -lrb- jamie foxx -rrb- who finds himself the hostage of contract killer , vincent -lrb- tom cruise -rrb- as he makes his rounds from hit to hit during one night in la . . one of the things that makes this film one of my favorites is the script and its characters . for example , while vincent is a cool calculating contract killer at the top of his game . max is a cabbie with big dreams and little to show for it . vincent embraces force , while max is the opposite . vincent has big opinions , max does n't . in a way , the character of vincent is the '' ghost of christmas future . '' the acting in the film is top-notch with cruise at the top of his game . say what you want about the guy , but he more than delivers in this film . the way he delivers his lines with a sense of subtitle irony is quite brilliant . foxx is just as good , especially when he begins to change character wise . there are so many awesome scenes from this film , that i ca n't really pick one to be my favorite . that whole `` yo , homie . is that my briefcase ? '' scene is just classic . i also love that whole dance club scene where vincent just goes crazy in close quarter combat . another one of my favorites is when vincent throws that chair threw the glass , but then he falls over the chair ! the ending is a little bit of a letdown ... .		8		1
hal ashby 's `` harold and maude '' neatly fits into the category of cult classic , chiefly by virtue of its subject matter . in brief , the film concerns a morbid young man who befriends a free-spirited septuagenarian . together they make about as unlikely a pair as you 'll ever see in a romantic comedy . the stars of the film , bud cort & ruth gordon , play their parts with relish . furthermore , the two have excellent chemistry together . besides the stars , vivian pickles , as harold 's overbearing mother , and charles tyner , as his uncle victor , stand out in support . ashby 's direction is well-handled and the film sports some nice visuals . however , the film 's best element on the technical side is arguably the soundtrack . the songs of cat stevens are heard throughout and they truly capture and enhance the spirit of the film . in the end , `` harold and maude '' is certainly a unique little film and one that seems way ahead of its time . it 's the sort of quirky movie that would be right at home next to some of today 's independent films . given it 's eccentricities , i 'm unsurprised that it was a commercial flop at the time of its release but , thankfully , it has gained in stature over time .		8		1
dirty dancing was the surprise smash hit of 1987 which told the story of an irresistible romance that develops between a nubile teenager and a dance instructor at a catskills resort when the girl 's family arrives at the resort for the summer . this deceptively simple plot provides the backdrop for one of the most innovative and ingratiating musicals to hit the screen in years with dance sequences that redefined movie choreography forever . jennifer grey -lrb- daughter of oscar winner joel grey -rrb- turns in a star-making performance as baby houseman , the young idealistic teen who finds her head turned one magical summer by the flashy johnny castle , played with sincerity by patrick swayze , who made it cool for guys to dance in the movies again . it is the undeniable chemistry between these two relatively unknown actors and some dazzling dance sequences that make this movie worth watching over and over again . swayze and grey are magic together and mention should be made of an outstanding supporting performance from the late jerry orbach as baby 's father . the film won the oscar that year for best song '' -lrb- i 've had -rrb- the time of my life '' which is used in the film 's spectacular finale . the film is irresistible and once you 've experienced it for the first time , multiple viewings will follow .		8		1
after about 15 minutes of `` the incredible hulk , '' i easily tossed aside and deserted all thoughts and pre-existing connections to ang lee 's 2003 `` hulk '' and willingly accepted this film 's complete makeover -- that 's how much better this film is than hulk 's first cut on the big screen . writer zak penn and director louis leterrier 's depiction of the green giant makes for a much more exciting action film and is way more believable . `` the incredible hulk '' epitomizes summer blockbuster while staying and not being completely devoid of audience empathy . `` incredible hulk '' picks off where 2003 's hulk left off , but basically rewrites everything up to that point . banner is in hiding from the u.s. military , trying to find ways of controlling his rate so he never becomes the hulk , and in the meantime communicating secretly with a scientist who might be able to help him cure his condition . when general ross -lrb- hurt -rrb- , who wants banner for his blood to make it into a weapon , finds where banner is hiding , the fun begins . the plot is rather cyclical in that ross tries to hunt down banner three different times and then the hulk gets away . each time is a bit different , mostly because one decorated military soldier -lrb- tim roth -rrb- begins taking ross ' `` supersoldier '' serum in effort to bring the hulk down and eventually his lust for strength turns him into the abomination . it 's not a great plot , but it 's straightforward , really easy and exciting to follow , very comic-like , and we can identify with banner 's need to find a cure for the uncontrollable beast inside him . norton is infinitely better than bana as bruce banner . the writing for his character is so much better to begin with -- you actually get the sense that he 's fighting the hulk and you see the connection between banner and this alter ego . they do n't feel completely separate from one another , which is something `` hulk '' of 2003 never did . ang lee gave us more introspective hulk , but leterrier gives us some of that in addition to a hulk that is more fierce , visceral and untamed . the cgi is more realistic and leterrier does a much better job at showing how inadvertently destructive the hulk really is and why banner wants it to go away . the action in this film is top notch in both live action and cgi . especially at the beginning it feels like a mix between superhero films and the `` bourne '' movies . marvel made a bold move bringing in `` transporter 2 '' director leterrier , but leterrier 's command of action makes this film great in at least that aspect alone . the action is brutal and relentless , never going soft which is exactly what you want from a movie about an uncontrollable green monster , especially one who fights an even crazier monster at the end . this kind of action is incomparable to any superhero film i 've seen and that 's a credit to leterrier . the script only scratches the surface thematically in terms of bruce 's struggle , but it 's enough to like and care about his character and let the action do the rest . you really get to know norton 's banner and that 's what matters . my other beefs with the film -lrb- liv tyler 's mediocrity , roth 's dialogue , abomination talking too much -rrb- are not significant enough to knock the film from its solid action superhero film status . ultimately , this film is very satisfying -- the direction , the creative hands that the hulk franchise is in -lrb- should it continue -rrb- is an extremely gratifying one .		8		1
tell no one is an ambitious adaptation of a harlan coben novel by french actor guillaume canet . i was completely surprised when checking out the actors ' names and seeing his as character philippe neuville , a deceased horse rider and integral part of the story . the writer/director could not be this young man ; with all the accolades and success in my eyes of this intricately plotted thriller , i was expecting someone older and more accomplished at the craft . knowing that this was put together by a young actor directing only his second feature just adds to the splendor at hand . it is often said , but i do believe it is true , actors seem to perform at their best with one of their own as leader . every performance is strong -- flawlessly enhancing a taut script that slowly uncovers the mystery of a woman 's disappearance and sudden surfacing eight years later . a husband and wife , two souls that have been together since grade school , go to his family 's land for an evening of skinny-dipping when she decides to go back and let the dogs out . a scream for help causes alexandre beck to go after margot , only to be struck twice with a bat , knocked unconscious , falling to the bottom of the lake . eight years pass and we discover he was somehow saved and found on the dock , in a coma , where he survived only to find that his wife 's body had been victim to a notorious serial killer . not quite allowing himself to let go , alexandre becomes close to his sister 's wife as confidant and buries himself in his work as a pediatrician . his job becomes his life and he loves the children that he helps , not doing it for the money , but instead the satisfaction of helping and saving lives . he even has cultivated a relationship with a local street thug bruno , in his debt after beck proved his son was a hemophiliac and was not beaten by his father . as the story continues on we find that we should all have a criminal on our moral payroll ... they can come in quite handy . when the doctor gets a strange email at work , he begins to question whether the body found almost a decade earlier was really that of margot . the message appears to be from her , trying to reach out in secrecy , because she says they are watching him . here is where the story could have gone off the tracks as it introduces so many different threads that all end up being well thought out and important . we become knowledgeable of a team of heavies keeping tabs on beck while the woman of the team inflicts torture through pressure points to gather information . deaths begin to mount and evidence starts to be planted , framing beck while also reigniting the speculation that he could have been the one to kill his wife . margot 's father begins to act strange , millionaire gilbert neuville is introduced along with the murder of his son , and the police inspectors on beck 's tail start to act smart and think that maybe something bigger than initially anticipated is going on . beck must do whatever he can to stay away from the men trying to kill him , the men trying to arrest him , and the sinking feeling that whoever is contacting him might not be the woman he ca n't live without . the slow unraveling of the story has its pros and cons . by not telling the audience who any of the characters are at the beginning , or their relationship to each other , we are keep in the dark and constantly surprised as they all reenter the story . a jovial dinner party starts the film and each person becomes a cog in the system as beck commences the journey to see whether margot is alive . what does n't work , however , is that this script is very airtight and extremely detailed . as a result , the audience begins to put the pieces together before the characters on screen do . sure the filmmakers try to deflect aspects by showing you one thing , -lrb- what certain actors are viewing -rrb- , before showing the truth , -lrb- what actually is happening -rrb- , the end result always ends up being what you think . therefore , the final half becomes a tad tedious , waiting for the inevitable to occur , wondering when beck and the rest will be brought into the light . i understand that we as viewers get to see things the cast does not , but i just thought they probably could have cut a half hour out by the finale . what is perfect , though , is the stellar acting . even with small roles , jean rochefort shines with his stoic , affluent stature , and kristin scott thomas is effective as beck 's best friend and sister-in-law , showing that she should have been born in france and not england . it is also a lot of fun seeing françois berléand as a dramatic police inspector to counter the comedic one he plays in the transporter series . the most memorable actors end up being our two leads , as one should expect nothing less . marie-josée croze 's beauty makes you believe the love and compassion her husband has for her . first seen by me last year in the diving bell and the butterfly , croze must go through many emotions here , the lover and the moral compass for those she works with ; when the truth is uncovered as to what really happened to her , you 'll see the strife gone through , breaking her into doing things you could n't think she was capable of . as for beck , françois cluzet carries this film on his back . his geniality is always prevalent , showing the most when with his patients , but while on the run , he really steps it up a notch . when traveling with bruno , he bluffs his way out of tight spots and even causes a gigantic automobile collision when running for his life . it is a complicated role and one he pulls off to perfection .		8		1
gong li is songlian , a nineteen year old whose father has died , which results in her marrying a wealthy man , master chen , becoming the fourth wife and third concubine . at first , she is well treated , even receiving foot massages . the other mistresses compete for the master 's attention . night he chooses one of them for an encounter . if chosen , a red lantern above the door is lit and the lady is given a menu to choose a meal from . is the oldest mistress , having born the master a son many years earlier . she no longer is physically attractive , so she just hangs out at the palatial estate . the second and third mistresses constantly scheme against each other , and both try to befriend songlian with plots to become the most favored of the master . songlian fakes a pregnancy but when a doctor is summoned to examine her , the master becomes infuriated and has her lamps covered in black cloth . she becomes totally isolated and gong li is magnificent , as usual , playing the doomed concubine .		8		1
grady tripp is a washed-up author . well , washed-up is a little harsh , perhaps , but he 's written exactly one book - five years ago . and he 's had writer 's block ever since . at present , he 's a shambling , shifty , scruffy , sloppy , disheveled college professor in the field of creative writing . in the morning , his wife leaves him . `` i lost a wife today , '' he later tells his agent crabtree -lrb- robert downey , jr. -rrb- . to which crabtree responds , `` you 'll find another . you always do . '' grady has a student living at his house -lrb- she was there before the wife left , so yes , it 's platonic -rrb- . another student , james lear -lrb- the ineffectual tobey maguire -rrb- is obsessed with death and can recite in alphabetical order the names of famous celebrity suicides . then there 's grady 's mistress , the chancellor of the college -lrb- frances mcdormand -rrb- . oh , and there 's a blind dog who hates grady , too . and a transvestite . and so it goes . anyone who 's ever written something , whether they 've been assigned to do so or just want to do it of their own volition , has at sometime or another had a problem getting started . with this review , in fact , i did n't know where to begin . once you get started , you 're ok . well , grady 's problem is quite the opposite . he has a different kind of writer 's block , you see . he has diarrhea of the mind . he 's been working on this book for five years . he has accumulated over 2,000 pages . `` the ending keeps getting further and further away , '' he says in voice-over narration . grady ca n't seem to finish his novel not because he ca n't figure out what to write but because he ca n't stop writing . his agent , crabtree , is in dire straits . grady 's all he has left , and in new york the other literary agents laugh at him . he comes to grady 's school during word week , an english gathering designed to be a way for some of the brighter writers to sell their works to attending agents . crabtree is a well-developed figure , too , and it seems to me that downey jr. was probably the wisest choice to play him . downey jr. turns in a magnificent , understated performance that 's the backbone of the film . maguire , as the critical character james , takes underplaying to a new level . he delivers his line in an , droll monotone . granted , there are several scenes in which this makes sense , but not all the time . maguire 's mannerisms are as deep as a puddle , and this is nothing new for the so-called wunderkind . i saw him in pleasantville and the cider house rules , to name a couple , and in neither was he more than mildly interesting . with that in mind , i was not disappointed in his work here . mcdormand is excellent in her brief scenes as the chancellor . she 's assuredly one of the best actresses working today , as her work here and in almost famous attests . she 's strong , iron-willed , charming , angry , petulant , and loving . a perfect foil for douglas ' grady . and douglas himself is a lot of fun . he 's so much the victim in here , but so much is also his own doing . he 's not a bad guy , and he tries his hardest to make things right , but as happens so often with guys in movies , what he tries fails , and what he does n't try haunts him .		8		1
david o. russell 's the fighter is about mickey ward , a junior welterweight fighter -lrb- mark wahlberg -rrb- the working class town of lowell , massachusetts whose struggles are as much outside of the ring as inside . based on a true story , the film revolves around mick 's s relationship with his dysfunctional family that includes his half-brother dickie eklund -lrb- christian bale -rrb- , an ex-fighter called `` the pride of lowell '' because he survived ten rounds with sugar ray leonard , his overbearing trash-talking mother , alice -lrb- melissa leo -rrb- and his repellent seven sisters who are little more than caricatures . mick worships dickie who insists he once floored sugar ray leonard , but dickie has become a crack addict who is unfit for the ring except to act as his brother 's trainer . a wiry , hyper-active individual , a role at times overplayed by bale , dickie is interviewed by hbo who dickie thinks they are filming a documentary on his boxing career only to find out that it is really a documentary about crack addiction in lowell . when mick is thrown into the ring with a fighter who weighs twenty pounds more than him and is beaten to little short of a pulp , mick begins to open his eyes to the fact that his career is being mishandled . the issue becomes further crystallized when he meets charlene fleming -lrb- amy adams -rrb- , a former college student who works as a bar girl , who tells him that he should accept a promoter 's offer to train in las vegas , away from the influence of his unstable family . charlene is a tough cookie with a good sense of humor and does n't back down easily . her resolve is tested , however , when she has to confront mick 's mother and his seven sisters who hold her opinion in little regard . with dickie serving a prison term for impersonating a police officer , mick 's turnaround in the ring begins when he hires a local cop to be his manager , leading him to a string of victories and an upcoming title fight in london , england , the emotional high point of the film . the push and pull continues with dickie , however , when he is released from prison and wants to resume his role as mick 's trainer . mick 's fight is as much for his manhood as it is for control of his career , but the issue is never satisfactorily resolved . the fights are orchestrated for maximum audience involvement . somewhat akin to ali 's `` '' , mick is repeatedly pummeled in the early rounds of his fights but comes to life when it seems he is done for . though this is an unlikely scenario , russell makes it believable and , at times exciting . mick , however , is a reluctant warrior who seems strangely out of place in a boxing ring . comparisons have been made between rocky -lrb- 1976 -rrb- and the fighter . rocky was also a gritty boxing movie about an underdog from the wrong side of the tracks who overcomes great odds to become a champion . rocky balboa , however , had heart and soul and inspired people to root for him and the film made you feel better about yourself . though there is some fine acting in the fighter , especially by amy adams , unlike rocky , we never have much invested in the outcome .		8		1
enemy at the gates -lrb- 2001 -rrb- was co-written and directed by jean-jacques annaud . the movie takes place during the battle of stalingrad , and is based on true historical events . jude law plays the soldier vassili zaitsev , a russian peasant who has the skills and the bravery to become the chief sniper for the beleaguered russian army in stalingrad . ed harris is major könig , the german sniper who was sent to stalingrad to eliminate vassili . both actors are excellent in their roles -- law as the intelligent , but unsophisticated , hunter , and harris as the worldly , arrogant officer who is also an amazing marksman . all russian military units were accompanied by political commissars . joseph fiennes stars as commisar danilov , who befriends vassili , and who is clever enough to recognize the propaganda value of a heroic russian sniper . both he and vassili are in love with soldier tania chernova , played by rachel weisz . bob hoskins does a brilliant job portraying nikita khrushchev , whose career was already on the rise during the battle for the city . the battle of stalingrad may have been the most important battle in world war ii . however , movies about battles belong on the history channel . as in `` saving private ryan , '' a war movie must involve us in the lives of the men and women who fought it . vassili 's story does , indeed , involve us . we are involved even more than in other war films , because the story is true . the german army , which at one point controlled 90 % of stalingrad , had totally disintegrated by the time the battle was over . determined russian resistance and the russian winter broke hitler 's army the way they broke napolean 's army . in napolean 's case , a tattered remnant of his army struggled back towards france . when the battle of stalingrad was over , there was n't any german army left to return home . hitler refused to consider retreat , when retreat was still an option . he told the german soldiers to fight to the last man and the last bullet , and that 's what they did . i saw this movie on dvd . it worked well enough , although it would surely have been better on a large screen .		8		1
so wheel in the schmaltz people . just like heaven 's tagline reads it ' a wonderful afterlife . and indeed it is although not very believable with some huge plot holes and logic lapses this type of film only works if you just let it all go and succumb to it . although a bit sillier than most , it also manages to pull out more laughs . courtesy of mean girls and freaky friday director mark waters . he keeps things moving along entertainingly so you do n't have a lot of time to question the film 's shallow reality . witherspoon and ruffalo make a fine screen couple there chemistry is acceptable and each of them does extremely well with their parts . they are the real reason this film works so well they deliver the laughs as well as the tears . witherspoon stars as elizabeth masterson a young doctor on her way up she works 26 hour shifts and has no room for her personal life . one day while driving home she is hit by a truck . months later ruffalo moves into her fully furnished apartment ad begins to with her ghost . after convincing her that she 's a spirit they go on a yellow brick quest to discover her whereabouts . along the way they run into a bunch of funny scenarios and characters and you guessed it ultimately end up falling for each other . it 's pretty predictable people and there are no real surprises in this film . especially a big twist which you should get in the first 15 minutes . but it moves along well and features a talented cast and entertaining direction . the cinematography is warm and dreamlike and the soundtrack is full of familiar pop hits to sing along too . so wheel in the schmaltz cause this film is schmaltzy but it 's a welcome feeling . like those silly but memorable 80 's -90 's movies we all grew up with -lrb- date with an angel , ghost -rrb- this is a lite fluffy classic for loads of dates to enjoy ! **** -lrb- out of five -rrb-		8		1
few films stay with me after time has passed but this is one of those that not only stays embedded in my psyche but shows everyone what making films is really about . story is about frankie dunn -lrb- clint eastwood -rrb- who is a boxing trainer and cut man who runs a gym in los angeles but he also attends mass and writes letters to his estranged daughter . living in a room in the back of the gym is eddie `` scrap iron '' dupris -lrb- morgan freeman -rrb- who was a fighter for 23 years and lost an eye in a bout that frankie worked on . after a fight card frankie is approached by maggie fitzgerald -lrb- hilary swank -rrb- who tells him that she wants to be a fighter and also wants him to train her but his response is `` i do n't train girls '' . ***** spoiler alert ***** maggie is from a white trash family in the ozarks and has been working as a waitress since she was 13 but she 's determined to be a fighter and shows up at the gym religiously and works very hard . scrap talks to frankie and convinces him to train her which he does reluctantly and after time passes she starts her professional career by knocking out her opponent . maggie becomes quite the sensation as she knocks out her opponents and eventually talks start for her to fight the female champion in her division -lrb- lucia rijker -rrb- and a fifty-fifty split for a million dollars . the fight is made but during the bout maggie is seriously injured and ends up in the hospital paralyzed from the neck down . as she lies in a hospital bed maggie also loses a leg and tells frankie that she wants to die and now he must dig deep into himself and his beliefs for what he is about to do . this is clint eastwood 's 25th effort in directing and it 's arguably his best ever which is incredible because last years `` mystic river '' was getting the same accolades . eastwood 's directing is such a joy to view simply because every scene in his films has some sort of meaning to them and nothing that we see is for nothing . the banter that takes place between frankie and scrap might appear to be idle chit chat but what it 's really doing is establishing the comfortable relationship that they obviously have . for me , this film is about pain and the three characters that carry pain around with them but do their best to keep going in life . the performances that take place on screen are three of the best not only this year but in the careers of these actors and freeman as scrap shows a man who 's been through extremely tough times but came out of it with dignity intact . eastwood has always been an underrated performer and while some critics think he relies too much on his incredible presence i still remember him giving solid efforts in several films . here he plays a character so haunted by his past that he would rather keep most people at a distance but his character gradually learns to love and care once again to the point that he must make the ultimate decision . eastwood is mesmerizing and he 's never been better . i have alway 's said that swank gave one of the great performances in cinema history in `` boys do n't cry '' and here she gives another great performance that proves to everyone that she 's no fluke . with her tenacity and earthiness swank gives viewers an utterly believable character from her athletic prowess to the gut wrenching scenes in the hospital bed . it 's a performance that will haunt viewers for years to come which is ironic because she did the same thing in 1999 with her oscar winning role . i 'm also a big boxing fan and i can find faults in some of the scenes such as the female champion hitting someone when they are down which in reality would result in an instant disqualification . these little flaws just mean that this film is n't entirely accurate but they do n't detract from the emotional power that builds during it 's duration . this is a tremendous effort from eastwood who again shows that his direction can bring out the best in actors but what may surprise everyone -lrb- including himself -rrb- is that he brought out his own brilliant performance .		8		1
i got this movie on dvd instead of going to the cinema . after reading review and watch it for myself , i can say this is an amazing movie with a good plot on it . julia gives brilliant performance as erin brockovich , someone who take down a company because of its mistake . also , something to admire is the dress that julia wear is simple marvelous .		8		1
*** spoilers ** whimsical and heart warming story that uses the game of baseball and the infamous 1919 chicago white sox , forever known as the chicago black sox , team as some kind of metaphor in bringing together transplanted from brooklyn ny farmer ray kinsella , kevin costner , with his long dead father john , brown , who passed away when ray was 14 . it was when walking through his corn field that ray keeps hearing this voice telling him `` that if you build it he will come '' . thinking that he 's suffering from a mild case of heat stroke ray does n't take it seriously until it , or the voice , shows him like a mirage in the desert a baseball diamond situated right in the middle of his cornfield ! it 's after when ray bulldozed most of his cornfield under to build a baseball diamond and outfield following the instructions of the mysterious voice that his daughter karin , gabby hoffman , notices a stranger wearing a baseball uniform hanging out on the field looking like he 's lost ! with ray and his wife annie , amy madigan , going to check things out it 's discovered that the stranger , wearing a 1919 chicago white sox uniform , in non other the the great shoeless joe jackson played by ray liotta . the most shocking thing about all this despite shoeless joe batting right-handed , he was in real life a left handed batter , the guy 's been dead and buried for almost 40 years ! flabbergasted at what he as well as his wife amy and daughter karin are seeing ray watches in stunned disbelief all the members of the 1919 chicago white sox emerge , like ghosts in the night , out of his remaining corn field to play perpetual baseball without even bothering to eat or sleep ! completely under the spell of the mysterious voice ray is told to travel to far off boston and get in touch with 1960 's activist and now in hiding and not talking or seeing anyone revolutionary and free love writer terrence , his friends if he still has any call him terry , mann played by james earl jones . it 's ray 's job according to the voice to not only take the at first very reluctant mann to the red sox a 's game at fenway park but also have the cash strapped ray , who just about went broke building his baseball field , to treat him to a beer & hot dog ! what the hell was all this about anyway ? what 's the reason for the voice to instruct ray to do these mindless crazy and stupid things ? we soon find out what 's really going on in the movie when on the giant tv scoreboard over fenway park 's right center field bleachers flashes the name archibald `` moonlight '' graham and the place where he 's supposed to be living chisholm that out of the thousands of spectators watching the ball game only ray & mann could see ! it 's when both ray and the now , in both seeing the light and hearing the voice , very agreeable terry mann , who at first thought that ray was out of his mind , travel to chisolm where they find out that archie , burt lancaster , has been dead for the last 16 years ! but that very pressing problem is solved with the two , ray & terry mann , soon find themselves brought back in time to the year 1972 just before graham , who was the town doctor , kicked off and thus be able to talk to him ! we later find out what doc . graham 's purpose was in the movie and it was two fold : one for himself and the other and far more important reason for the kinsella family ! *** spoilers *** you 've got to suspend belief watching `` field of dreams '' like everyone in it including ray 's brother in law mark , timothy busfield , who at first thought that he and his sister amy were nuts but later saw , when the 1919 white sox revealed themselves to him , the light of `` reality '' and went along with the program ! touching and emotionally packed final when ray gets to meet his dad john who like almost everyone else in the movie came back from the dead to play a game of catch with him ! and while that 's happening not only did he , ray 's dad john , come like the mysterious voice predicted he would but we see cars coming for near and far from all over the state as well as the entire usa to fill the cornfield 's spectator seats to capacity at 20 dollars a pop . all that in order for them to watch both father and son together with the 1919 chicago white sox lead by shoeless `` say it ai n't so '' joe jackson playing the great all american game of baseball !		8		1
i think this was the movie that changed comedies and the way we see them now . ever since this movie , there have been comedies similar to this that came out and i pretty much liked them all . but this is the one that started it all . steve carell also got famous due to this movie . this is about what the title says . it 's about a 40-year-old who never had sex before and is afraid to commit . but things get interesting when he sees the love of his life . also he has to deal with crazy crap from his co worker buddies . the acting is pretty good . steve carell was pretty funny and i loved the chest waxing scene . i also enjoyed the performances of seth rogen and paul rudd . overall , i thought this was a decent comedy . they made better over the next few years but this was still a good one . i rate this film 8/10 .		8		1
i honestly was n't very interested in watching hugo , because even though i admire various films directed by martin scorsese , the fact that a filmmaker who is mostly famous for portraying the new york criminal scene with a devastating rawness decided to make a family film full of fantasy seemed very strange to me . however , hugo ended up being much better than i expected , and it has enough positive elements in order to consider it a very good film . i have to say that i was n't liking hugo very much on the beginning . the idealized parisian setting created by scorsese and his production designer dante ferretti is impressive , but it also transmits a very marked artificiality . come on , i even found the movement from the extras , as well as the picturesque details from the railway station , excessively forced . however , when the screenplay changes its course , ignoring its eponymous main character in order to focus on monsieur george , hugo takes a very different personality , and that is the point when i started liking this film pretty much , until leading to a perfect ending . and i would also like to mention the excellent performances , starting by ben kingsley 's as the old man who ca n't hide his greatness behind his embittered exterior and intolerant attitude . asa butterfield is absolutely likable and credible as hugo cabret , while the great chloe moretz brings honesty and spontaneity to her role . however , hugo 's main star is scorsese , who displays his solid narrative sense and passionate direction once more . despite having some complaints against it , i think hugo is a very interesting experience which is worthy to be watched on the big screen , and not only because of its visual spectacle -lrb- the 3d is pretty good , but i would n't consider it indispensable in order to appreciate the movie -rrb- , but also because of the message it transmits about the cinema as an artistic expression . and , on its simpler shape of a family film , hugo fulfills with its intention of touching , entertaining and teaching us .		8		1
a strung-out junkie -lrb- frank sinatra -rrb- deals with daily demoralizing drug addiction while crippled wife -lrb- eleanor parker -rrb- and card sharks continue to pull him down . while this is not the first film to deal with drugs , it is probably the first to deal with them in a very serious manner . `` reefer madness '' and `` cocaine fiends '' , for example , can be written off as humorous nostalgia . this film , on the other hand , is decades ahead of `` trainspotting '' and `` requiem for a dream '' . -lrb- did you even know heroin addiction was prominent in the 1950s ? -rrb- variety called the film `` a gripping , fascinating film , expertly produced and directed and performed with marked conviction by frank sinatra as the drug slave . '' i agree for the most part , though i really did not enjoy sinatra 's acting as much as many others did , i think . otto preminger is a first-rate director , and i hope this film gets the respect it deserves over the long run -lrb- i found the 50th anniversary release to be not nearly cleaned up enough -rrb- . while the focus is heroin and addiction , one could also make a case about this film being about love . frankie 's wife brings him down , encourages him to go back to his old habits , turns him away from his dreams . molly -lrb- kim novak -rrb- does just the opposite . divorce and adultery are hardly ever positive topics , but in this film you almost hope that frankie goes that route .		8		1
i 've never seen a danny de vito film i did n't like , and smoochy is no exception . original and creative at every turn , with great performances from edward norton , robin williams , catherine keener , and everyone else in the cast . i smiled and/or laughed through the whole film . what more can you ask from a bent and twisted comedy , i ask you ?		8		1
the story = two sisters alice and karen , karen is nice sweet goody two shoes who is the apple of her parents eyes and sings in the church choir , while alice is the slightly disturbed one who spends her time running around wearing a yellow raincoat and a freaky clown mask and bullies her younger sister and very much jealous of her , but when karen gets murdered during her catholic confirmation and after that more people start to die and it seems that alice is number one suspect , the killer wears the same mask and same yellow raincoat as she does but could alice be the killer or is it someone else ... `` alice sweet alice '' is almost like two films rolled in one joint of sweet horror spices . on the surface , it plays off like a typical slasher with a masked loony in tow -lrb- that 's one creepy get-up -rrb- , red herrings galore , stalk sequences , plasma splashes and a thick mystery behind the madness to boot . every time i thought i had what was really going on the movie would slap you with a twist . the games it played kept me intrigued , that 's for damn sure ! but here 's the kicker ; beneath the surface there was also actual thick substance to this story . this movie definitely had some disturbing parts in it like that fat guy and his creepy child molesting ways really got to me and some of the brutal attacks like the auntie getting stabbed in the feet when she was climbing down the stairs was really freaky and the constant injection of unsettling religious imagery throughout -lrb- always creepy to me -rrb- to support what was being said . tackling such weighty themes via a slasher formula is one hell of a ballsy move and one which i appreciated and respected highly . plus the murder of karen at the beginning was really disturbing and really got to me . rudolph willrich -lrb- father tom -rrb- was very likable in his role , linda miller -lrb- catherine -rrb- astounded me as the mother , very natural and believable as a parent stuck in this sort of situation , paula sheppard -lrb- alice -rrb- is true star of the movie she was brilliant and kept you guessing all the way through . brooke shields -lrb- karen -rrb- she shined in her brief moment of screen time she was very sweet in her tragic role . all in all alice sweet alice is a disturbing masterpiece although some people will be put off by some of the disturbing themes and other than that it 's a well rounded slasher/thriller whodunit and trust me you wo n't see this coming .		8		1
after years of enjoying their collaborations on the pink panther movies , i finally got to see blake edwards ' - peter sellers ' only film , the party . playing a indian actor accidentally invited to a hollywood party , sellers inadvertently causes one disaster after another as guests just tolerate his presence despite no one really knowing who he is or why he 's there . it 's not until much later that producer gavin macleod even remembers him for ruining his picture in the movie 's beginning scenes . by then , sellers ' character gets to know macleod 's latest discovery -lrb- and potential conquest -rrb- claudine longet . their scenes are some of the sweetest in this mostly very funny movie . and there 's plenty very humorous stuff concerning mishaps caused not only by sellers but also by a drunken waiter played to great hilarity by steve franken . it threatens to lose steam in the middle part but comes to a wonderful crescendo at the end . by all means , if you 're a great fan of both edwards and sellers , do n't pass this one by ! p.s. having previously only known ms. longet from a shooting scandal of hers 30 years ago that was parodied on an snl sketch the first season , i 'm now glad to finally see her on screen as she was years before that unfortunate incident and hear her wonderful singing voice and french accent .		8		1
there will never be another edith piaf in epitomizes the was the only artist whose songs reflected her tragical few exceptions , all these songs are desperate songs , from the wagnerian `` hymne à l'amour '' which marguerite monnot composed after cerdan 's death - although some writers claimed it had been composed before - to `` non , je ne regrette rien '' which the singer recorded at a time when she was piaf was the only popular artist who was embraced by intellectuals : cocteau wrote a play for her and he died a few hours after and jean were among her had even fans in the world of rock/pop : patti smith , jeff buckley -lrb- who covered `` j' pas la fin '' , an obscure number from the thirties -rrb- , willy / mink de ville , marianne faithful -lrb- who made an exciting version of `` les prisons du roy '' -rrb- . astrid the beatles ' german friend used to listen to her records too -lrb- see `` backbeat '' -rrb- what am i driving , this is a difficult , nay almost impossible 's attempt -lrb- `` piaf '' 1973 from simone `` momone '' -rrb- was dismal and besides , it stopped with leplée 's worse was lelouch 's `` edith and marcel '' where edith 's voice was dubbed !!! -lrb- by a pop singer ! -rrb- . olivier dahan 's did not probably make the definitive piaf biopic - as users have already pointed out , it would take a miniseries : the half-sister 's book , a 700 + pages biography is impossible to transfer to the it 's easily the best to cotillard easily her rivals -lrb- brigitte ariel and evelyne -rrb- in a cesar - calibre she does not get the award , it will be as unfair as ellen losing her aa to julia problem for marion cotillard will be to find a follow up to the french runaway blockbuster of the year ... olivier dahan , flouting chronology , chose key moments in piaf 's eventful can regret that the songs are cut , particularly `` milord '' -lrb- which cher covered in america -rrb- and `` hymne à l'amour '' . minor quibbles : the actor playing cerdan is too refined , too `` playboy '' to portray cerdan successfully , a great boxer but an uneducated man whose favourite reading was the -lrb- `` pim pam poum '' in french -rrb- and whom piaf herself tried to cultivate his mind -lrb- she made him read , reportedly mary webb 's `` '' -rrb- ; and theo sarapo 's absence : he was her last love , and a true love dedicated to her , he sweetened her awful last moments , together they sang a duet which was a hit `` a quoi ça l'amour ? ` theo sarapo -lrb- sarapo = i love you in greek -rrb- deserved a niche in piaf 's bad . on the other hand , piaf 's faith in sainte thérèse de lisieux remained intact -lrb- there is a pilgrimage in the movie -rrb- till her last her funeral stopped the traffic in paris , she was refused a christian ceremony , the church having declared that she lived in dietrich who was here -lrb- she briefly appears in the movie , played by caroline ; remember the german actress sang `` la vie en rose '' in hitchcock 's `` stage fright '' -rrb- cried out : `` how much did they love her !

burt lancaster and paul scofield headline this action packed film where in occupied france , 1944 , the treacherous nazis attempt to loot masterful art works back to germany and are eventually thwarted by french resistance . there were some scenes that paul scofield was still too british for me . it is only towards the end of the film that his real nazi cruelty is revealed . jeanne moreau does an interesting turn as the innkeeper who hides lancaster , after his act of sabotage . still hard to believe that the germans were duped into thinking that they were heading back to germany while in reality they were going deeper into france . the film shows the monetary greediness of germany during the war and a colonel 's refusal to believe that all is lost for them as the allies come closer to liberating france .		8		1
one can pretty much predict how bad an adam sandler flick can be . his last major big-budget movie , ` anger management , ' although having jack nicholson , could not keep itself afloat . after all , jokes and great actors can not outweigh a lack of reasonable plot . nonetheless , sandler 's flicks for the most part are big money makers and his fans are always there for him . with his new movie , ` 50 first dates , ' sandler brings back his brand of slapstick and pubescent humor to actually make a film that is somewhat good . in fact , ` 50 first dates ' has a surprising bit of sentiment to a love story that seems like it came from the farrelly brothers . ` 50 first dates ' tells the story of henry roth -lrb- sandler -rrb- , a vet who meets a woman at a local restaurant whom to his chagrin has lost her short-term memory . he realizes this when after meeting her , he goes back to the restaurant and finds that she does not even remember who he is . he learns from a waitress that the girl 's name is lucy -lrb- drew barrymore -rrb- and that she was in an accident about a year ago in which she sustained a head injury . as such , lucy 's father , brother , and the workers at the restaurant all make lucy think that she 's living the same day over again . lucy 's father and brother warn henry to stay away from her feeling that his presence will only confuse her when she forgets about the day . but everyone knows that letting go of love is not an easy process . as such , henry puts together a video in which he shows lucy pictures of the crash and gently lets her know what has happened to her , and has happened during the previous year that she has missed . but the problem is that henry will have to do this day in and day reliving first dates for lucy . although the premise seems fallible if not insulting to those who suffer from forms of memory loss , this film 's heart is in the right place . one can tell that the characters genuinely care about each other . sandler provides his shtick of making up songs about a pretty girl that he loves who has lost her memory . furthermore , the video that he keeps remaking for lucy describing the changes in her life and in the world that she does not remember is actually heartfelt . on to the comedy did not start out well . a perfect example that this film was heading in the wrong direction happened in a scene where a walrus vomits all over a fellow veterinarian . as an audience member , one can not decide whether to laugh or be disgusted . moreover , it would not be a sandler flick without some character getting beat this case its rob schneider who plays henry 's pal ula , a burned out shark catcher . it was nice to associate sean astin with something other than ` lord of the rings . ' he plays lucy 's brother doug , who is obsessed with perfecting his with the help of steroids . other than his gross display of peck flexing , doug speaks with a lisp and can not fight to save his life . his funniest scene occurs when he discusses a supposed friend 's problem of having wet dreams and his fear that it could be related to steroid use . the doctor , played by dan akroyd , simply says , ` get off the sauce ! ' ` 50 first dates ' is not a great movie , but with its surprising blend of a decent sincere love story and comedy , the film succeeds in entertaining us . ***		8		1
where the wild things are gave the local distributors here a hard time deciding whether to let it loose on the big screen , or not . the trailer was played for some time , and the posters went up , but slowly but surely the release date got perpetually pushed back , until everything got yanked off the screen . this is probably the first film here that had a facebook group -lrb- now quite defunct -rrb- set up for movie fans to clamour for its hopefully eventual screening which did n't materialize , but got a sizable following that went on to organize a dvd collective purchase of sorts . at first i thought , it 's quite the no brainer to market it because it 's adapted from a popular kid 's story written by maurice sendak , so the target audience would naturally be the kids , right ? not quite , as after watching the film , director spike jonze had weaved quite the mature tale here , sans any semblance of a cutesy nature that could be squarely targeted at its supposedly intended niche audience . besides , jonze is not quite the known entity around here , and a culmination of such factors made the distributors have cold feet . so it was what it was , and all we got was a local dvd release . which is a pity of course , as i would have relished the opportunity to see the gigantic wild things here on the big screen . but i digress . this is probably a film meant for and speaking out to the spoilt brats out there , be they young or old . we follow max -lrb- max records -rrb- the protagonist of the story as he gets his snow igloo broken by friends of his sister claire -lrb- pepita emmerichs -rrb- before going on a whirlwind destruction of her room . that 's a typical sign of trouble to come , but with children as they hit out where they can , especially with his sister 's absence . we learn that he 's not quite the quiet boy he may seem to be on the exterior , and surely he throws a tantrum when he does n't get the attention he needs from his mom -lrb- catherine keener -rrb- when she brings home a boyfriend -lrb- mark ruffalo -rrb- whom she has to entertain . running away in frustration and anger -lrb- and possibly a childlike pettiness as well -rrb- , here 's where the story gets interesting as he goes into a fantastical world where things inhabit , making friends with a bunch of them large monsters voiced by the likes of james gandolfini , paul dano , catherine o'hara , michael berry jr , chris cooper , lauren ambrose and forest whitaker even . they crown max king of their land based on the lies cooked up by him about his magical abilities , in the hopes that he 'll bring happiness to the group . alas for all his ideas with his new playmates , he soon finds out that if one of them is emotionally difficult , and probably his best friend and favourite amongst the group , everyone does not get better off and any marked improvements they had made took two steps back . in some ways this parallels his own life and provides him that mirror , before gaining maturity in knowing what needs to be done best . the amazing fusion of live action and live sized puppetry combined with cg is what stands out in the film , especially when the wild things come out , moving and emoting as if they were truly real creatures . the fantastical landscapes made up of large deserts and beaches also makes the film quite the visually arresting piece that leaves you wide-eyed and marvelling and how seamless all elements seem to come together in presentation . while the story 's quite the given that it 's a literary classic quite familiar with many , jonze has this adult like treatment in what may seem like a children 's story on the surface , which probably made distributors think twice about their bottom line , which is indeed a pity . but there 's always the alternative dvd route to take to watch the film , and i 'm glad i did . do n't let this slip you by , and perhaps one day we may see more market ambiguous films take to the cinemas here , given a strong and growing niche audience who can be counted on to support well made films that contain the whole works from competent acting to a story that moves .		8		1
i once made the observation that ` aliens ' deserves an award for panache for trying to outdo ` alien . ' it would be more accurate to say it takes the story of ripley and those slimy , malevolent lifeforms in a direction that the first movie did n't even try to ; specifically , into the realm of flicks . to its credit , it keeps much of the original 's look and feel , in art direction and sound . but the volume -lrb- so to speak -rrb- is cranked way up , as is the violence quotient , and the last 45 minutes or so feel like a roller-coaster ride through hell . opinions differ whether or not this is an improvement ; my own feeling is that ` alien ' is the superior film , hands down . but ` aliens ' certainly won the box office battle and has always been more generally popular . the plot has ripley -lrb- sigourney weaver -rrb- going back to the deadly planet with a squad of ` colonial marines . ' it is 57 years later -lrb- she slept that long in suspended animation before being discovered -rrb- and the planet is now inhabited by humans in a small , desolate community . the aliens -lrb- and there are a bunch of them now -rrb- never bothered the colonists until recently and when contact with earth ceases , the marines are sent in and ripley goes with them as a reluctant ` advisor . ' the marines themselves are a colorful group of stereotypes , straight out of an old ww2 war flick - the tough-as-nails sergeant , the quiet loner , the two bad-ass machine gunners , the whiner , etc. . they are led by an ineffective lieutenant who we soon discover is n't up to the challenge . also along for the ride is the ` company man , ' burke -lrb- paul reiser , in a nice turn as a complete slimeball -rrb- . after an early encounter with the aliens cuts their number in half , ripley more or less assumes command by sheer force of personality . -lrb- and weaver out-acts the pants off whoever she shares the screen with . -rrb- there are plenty of slam-bang shoot - 'em - up sequences , all very well staged and very intense . but somewhere along the way , ` aliens ' diminishes the essential creepiness of the creatures just slightly by making them so often exploding targets . and the audience realizes long before the marines that it does n't matter how many of them you kill , there are always more . a single colony survivor , a young girl named newt , is adopted by ripley and the others and proves more savvy than any of them . there is a funny , scary moment early on shortly after newt is found ; ripley asks her if she would n't feel safer staying with ripley and the others . the little girl just shakes her head no . ripley goes on to say these are soldiers , and newt responds , `` it wo n't make any difference . '' after chases , explosions , more gunplay and one false climax , we get the final showdown between ripley , in one of the spaceship 's loaders , and the alien queen . -lrb- trying to distract the queen from pursuing newt , weaver spits out her famous line , `` get away from her , you bitch ! '' -rrb- the fight itself is fairly brief , and the queen is finally dispatched off out into space , much like the alien in the first film was . director james cameron certainly deserves credit for not making a boring sequel ; ` aliens ' is anything but . it would probably be hoping for too much to expect a second film to be as wondrously terrifying as ridley scott 's original ; like capturing lightning twice , almost impossible . so cameron wisely shifts gears and takes us on a different adventure altogether , and it 's a very exciting one .		8		1
the franchise resurrects . the cast matures . the crew grows up . and , the rock joins the gang . the derailed series is finally back on track since the original with upgrades in all the departments of film-making . taking a different route this time & transforming the street racing franchise with the heist action film has worked wonders for the movie & the franchise . i really went in with low expectations but came out more than satisfied . it is n't only the best installment in the series but is also one brilliant action film to come out in a while now . fast five is the genuine summer blockbuster of the year , without a doubt . the fifth installment in the series & fourth movie in chronological order is set this time , in rio de janeiro . vin diesel , paul walker are joined by the supporting actors from the previous installments to pull off a heist plan to steal $ 100 million from the corrupt businessman while being pursued for arrest by the rock who plays an us police agent . justin lin & chris morgan finally unearthed the fact that it 's not the jaw-dropping scenes but those scenes backed up with a good , engaging plot that makes the movie a roller-coaster ride . giving more attention to gun fights , brawls & heist this time , thus changing the whole formula that existed , they really have given this series a whole new dimension . the actors have matured & it did show in their quality of acting compared to the previous installments . the soul of the franchise aka vin diesel gave a highly impressive performance but the unexpected yet equally impressive was the rock . he truly was enjoying his character & that reflected in his performance . the movie succeeds much more with its action & chase sequences than it does with its fine - tuned story . full of unrelenting furious action moments , eye-popping chases & loud , bombastic jaw-dropping automotive destruction , fast five has everything you wish in an action film . car chases , foot chases , gun fights , fist fights , explosions , heist etc. . . it 's all in there in a big way . one scene to watch out for is the battle of the ages , vin diesel taking on the rock ... & is one big highlight of the film . all in all , fast five is a huge improvement over its predecessors . it is a new breath of life in an almost dead franchise & a very welcomed one . more of the emphasis is on action this time rather than going all over again to the car culture , so that changes everything up . i wo n't say that this movie is flawless or gon na win numerous awards but it 's cool & that 's what this franchise always aimed to be & with fast five , it hits the jackpot . highly engaging , full throttle , action-packed roller-coaster ride , fast five has all the ingredients in right amount to make up for a highly satisfying summer blockbuster . and you really do n't wan na miss an entertainment like this . p.s. wait till the end credits are over . there 's still some twist in the tale .		8		1
can you guess what movie topped the charts as the most rented film of 2003 ? in the year that brought us such blockbusters as two matrix sequels , an x-men and terminator entry and even a big fat greek wedding , you may not hit the jackpot if given 10 guesses and a handful of hints . that is because the $ 121 million domestic grossing bourne identity is the answer to the query , and with movies now being able to double and triple their theatrical runs on the small screen , it is no surprise that this week sees jason bourne back for another adventure in the bourne supremacy . for those of you that require a refresher course before sitting down to new sequential installments , bourne -lrb- matt damon -rrb- was fished out of the water in the bourne identity and struggled through the film to regain his memory whilst dodging deadly assassins through europe . bourne would later find out that he was once part of the cia , but he leaves that world behind and runs to a india with new female companion marie -lrb- franka -rrb- stating that ' . . if i even feel somebody behind me , there is no measure to how fast i will bring this fight to your doorstep . ' well , this is the entertainment business and a statement like that can only mean one thing ... . . the bourne supremacy picks up with jason 's new life being threatened when he is framed for a murder of two individuals of a cia covert action 4,000 miles away . the perpetrators of the crime want to kill him to cover their tracks , the cia wants to kill him because they are convinced he is a loose cannon and bourne dodges both parties from city to city putting the pieces together to help clear his name and ultimately reveal who the is the wizard behind the curtain . since it is too easy to compare a sequel to its predecessor , i will follow the rule to a tee and reveal that the second bourne is better than first . hats off to new director paul greengrass who 's only resume green flag was the 2002 documentary bloody sunday which chronicled the irish civil rights protest of 1972 . a curious choice then indeed , but now in hindsight , probably the best man for the job . supremacy flings us through country and city after city with such ferocity that i felt i was reading the bottom left hand side of the screen every five minutes to have revealed the next extravagant location . a director with a flare for documentary film-making knows about pacing and with india , virginia , berlin , munich and moscow all being thrown at us before we get to the rim of our popcorn bags , the pacing in the hands of simplistic action director may have sunk the film . but even as i give kudos to the man behind the camera it is the action star with the franchise strapped firmly on his back that i have to give the most credit . matt damon -lrb- bourne -rrb- has left his fellow childhood friend ben affleck in his dust with his choice of roles and acting ability and with the bourne films he is able to pull off a persona that does n't seem to realize his ability until forced into action . a scene at a naples airport where bourne is detained and sits quietly waiting to erupt is a classic example of what we have come to expect from the once covert assassin . he sits without emotion or expression only to in an instant , overpower two guards and download information from a hand-held computer device in what shoots across the screen in about 7 seconds . also back for a second time are ward abbott -lrb- brian cox -rrb- as the cia director that has more secrets than helpful ideas for the cause , and nicky -lrb- julia stiles -rrb- a cia agent profiler that might have a few keys to the locks in bourne 's brain he is so desperately trying to access . luckily these two characters have significant , but small parts as both actors provided weak performances in an otherwise strong cast . cox looked tired and delivered his lines like he had a bus to catch which is probably truce since he has participated in no less than 5 movies this year alone -lrb- look out stiller -rrb- , and stiles breaking down and crying when confronted with the inquisitive bourne was hard to believe as a character that responsible the analysis of the mental well-being of other agents . as for action sequences , supremacy delivers two fold over the original . it 's climactic chase scene was incredible in its choreography and you will undoubtedly shake your head wondering at what point did they extract the star and replace him with the stunt actor . damon looks to be the director 's human piñata and the authenticity of seeing broken glass fly into his face as his car skids , smashes and ultimately becomes makes this one of the best car chase scenes since ronin . the bourne supremacy is more complex than the first and the addition of the pamela landy -lrb- joan allen -rrb- character and the complex way to which she is between two agendas trying to find the truth while bourne both somewhat trusts and uses her to find the truth , is a refreshing way to have a story unfold in a summer of huge explosions and pointless humor . i understand that there are three books in the robert ludlum trilogy of mr. bourne 's adventures and it has been a while since i have looked forward to the hopes of a sequel so quickly after exiting the theatre of the last . but that is exactly what these films have done . we actually care about the hero of the film and we want him to find out more about his past as it sits like a piece of popcorn stuck in our teeth that we want to expose . i look forward to installment three and have already cleared a spot for the dvd box set beside the indiana jones and jack ryan series on my wall unit . thumbs way up .		8		1
`` patriot games '' was the second of author tom clancy 's stories about cia analyst jack ryan to be adapted for the screen . we last met ryan in `` the hunt for red october '' two years earlier in the person of alec baldwin . baldwin was offered the role in this film , but to his everlasting regret , turned it down and harrison ford as a more mature ryan was cast in the role . this story focuses more on the perils of ryan and his family rather than espionage . jack ryan -lrb- ford -rrb- , a college professor , his wife sally -lrb- anne archer -rrb- , who is also a doctor , and their daughter sally -lrb- thora birch -rrb- are in britain for jack 's speaking engagement . as they meet thereafter , they stumble upon a plot by a breakaway sect of the irish republican army -lrb- ira -rrb- , to murder lord william holmes -lrb- james fox -rrb- a member of the british royal family . the group is led by kevin o'donnell -lrb- patrick bergin -rrb- and includes his girl friend annette -lrb- polly walker -rrb- , sean miller -lrb- sean bean -rrb- and his brother paddy -lrb- karl hayden -rrb- . ryan instinctively jumps into the action and foils the assassination plot killing young paddy miller and capturing his brother sean . sean miller is distraught over his kid brother 's death and vows revenge on ryan and his family . the ryans return to their home in maryland and jack returns to his job as a professor at the us naval academy , annapolis . all is going well until miller escapes from custody and is consumed with hatred for ryan , the man who killed his brother . admiral greer -lrb- james earl jones -rrb- and marty cantor -lrb- j.e. freeman -rrb- visit ryan 's home and inform him of miller 's escape and try to entice him back to the cia . ryan refuses . miller , o'donnell et al turn up in the us and try to kill jack but fail . miller attacks cathy and sally in their car causing a crash in which both are injured . this angers jack who then decides that the best way to fight these people is with the resources of the cia , so he returns to the organization . a senior ira representative , paddy o'neal -lrb- richard harris -rrb- , in the us on a fund raising effort , swears that the ira was not responsible for the attacks on lord holmes and ryan and his family . ryan forces o'neal to reveal the identity of the mysterious woman -lrb- annette -rrb- whom ryan saw when the attempt was made on his life , in return for ryan 's not the ira . ryan analyzes the available data and tries to locate the group 's training facilities by satellite . the british meanwhile , suspect that there is an insider on lord holmes ' staff who provides the terrorists with information on his itinerary . as it happens , lord holmes will be in the us on a certain date and wants to present ryan with an award for saving his life . since ryan is planning a party for the return home of his injured daughter , lord holmes is invited to attend . the terrorists get wind of this , attack the party , killing the guards and ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . . ford makes an excellent jack ryan . he brings a maturity and vulnerability to the role that was lacking in baldwin . anne archer is the perfect foil for him as his wife . sean bean almost steals the picture as the hate obsessed terrorist sean miller . bergin and walker as well , make scary villains as well . samuel l. jackson appears as ryan 's friend from annapolis lt. . robby jackson . followed by `` a clear and present danger '' -lrb- 1994 -rrb- .		8		1
it 's hard to believe , but ten years ago m. night shymalan was actually a really good director with a knack of thrilling audiences with signs , the sixth sense , and this movie unbreakable . i found this movie to be the weaker of the three in part of a unsatisfactory ending but the build up to the third act is great and right on par with the sixth sense and signs . this film is about a security guard who is the only survivor of a train crash . soon afterwords , he meets this mysterious stranger who happens to be a comic book collector and a big believer of related human traits and events between comic books and reality . after this meeting , no one 's lives will be the same again . for a movie like this , they only needed two brand-name actors and they happened to be bruce willis and samuel l. jackson . bruce willis had a toned-down performance which is quite unlike him but i liked his sense of caution and quietness . samuel l. jackson simply reminded me of some of his other roles and that 's a good thing because i respect him a lot . overall , this is a tense thriller especially with the first two-thirds of the movie . the last act is good on paper and was okay executed on screen but i felt it could have been much more . i did n't feel the emotion i felt in the other two films i mentioned . it 's a shame that m. night shymalan has lost his value over the years , but unbreakable is one of his good ones . i rate this film 8/10 .		8		1
nothing to lose is a very funny feel good comedy that starts on a high and stays there throughout . martin lawrence and tim robins have a chemistry on screen that is very rarely seen in comedies these days . perhaps it is the black white thing that makes it funny , i dont know bot what i do know is that i laughed out loud to myself a few times which uncommon in american movies . as for british comedies , well thats a different thing ... 8 out of 10 .		8		1
james best -lrb- rosco p. coltrane from tv 's the dukes of hazzard -rrb- plays thorne sherman , captain of a boat delivering supplies to a group of scientists working on a remote island . when a hurricane whips up , sherman is forced to wait out the storm at the boffins ' abode , which is laid siege during the night by a pack of over-sized man-eating mutant shrews , the unfortunate result of the scientists ' experiments . with the possible exception of the giant rabbits from cult classic night of the lepus , shrews have got to be the most ridiculous choice ever for a killer animal in a cheesy b-movie horror film , even if they are over-sized , poisonous shrews . it 's this patently ridiculous concept , along with the terrible realisation of the creatures themselves -lrb- dogs dressed in rodent costumes and a manky model shrew head for close-ups -rrb- and some cheesy dialogue , that helps make the killer shrews one of the most entertaining 50s monster movies i 've seen . but although it is undoubtedly good for a laugh , believe it or not there is more to the film than just scientific hogwash , doggies in disguise , and clumsy conversation : the film 's basic siege set-up proves to be extremely effective -lrb- so much so that it most likely provided inspiration for george romero 's night of the living dead -rrb- , best puts in a pretty good performance as the film 's hero , and director ray kellogg somehow manages a fair amount of tension and one or two decent scares , the shrew in the kitchen being an absolute corker ! 7.5 out of 10 , rounded up to 8 for thorne 's ingenious escape plan , the likes of which would n't have been out of place in an episode of the a-team .		8		1
the insider is a very serious film ; it has none of typical hollywood sweet sentiments . instead , it offers us a very deep insight into the modern-day problem -- a struggle between an individual and a multi-national tobacco corporation . all the means is good here -- bribery , libel , lies and blackmail . but the main hero , here played by russell crow , is undaunted , and despite the threats and loss of a family , he goes on . another main character , here performed by always impeccable al pacino , is a hot-tempered cbs journalist , who is not afraid either of some mighty lebanese mullah or not less mighty tobacco moguls . he also goes on and he wins . the happy end here is not a false , sugary sweet melodrama type of end . nay , since the whole plot is based on a real story , the director mike mann made it as it was . yes , the happy ending , but after so much sufferings and losses . what is good , the movie does not thrive on blood or violence . what is a bit rude and even shocking , all the heroes use too much of the f-word . the cameo appearances of gina gershon and stephen tobolowsky are also a nice surprise and they add some certain spice to the plot . in general , if you like deep , mature , serious dramas about every day life and such like , watch that ! mind some foul language , though .		8		1
this film is dedicated to all the women out there who think their husbands are gods and want to be perfect . this film is a laugh at them and a slap in their faces . it talks about women who are robots , perfect hair , perfect skin , perfect body and cheesy smiles and women -lrb- nicole kidman -rrb- who are normal , sassy , bright and no weird grins . this movie cleverly points out that women can be better than men and that men are n't always right . the movie is ok , but there are times when you nearly pull your hair out because the wives are so incredibly stupid . like when glen close is talking about her own aerobics and a wife says because her name is claire , you want to get a newspaper and swot her round the head and scream `` no ! she 's talking about her car ! '' the movie is like a cartoon , robots and all , is so disney like . the only thing missing is a guy in a pink dress with a magic wand ! the movie can get a bit ridiculous at times and it can be really unfunny but overall it 's ok .		8		1
the 1939 musical is , without doubt , one of the greatest movies of all time . but , until this effort , baum 's source material was never returned to . the musical version has some dark moments : this non-musical sequel is considerably darker throughout . there is some fabulous visual imagination , , some brilliant of real life with oz -lrb- better than was done in the 1939 version -rrb- , and some excellent performances , particularly from the young fairuza balk as an altogether grittier , if less melodious , dorothy than judy garland . jean marsh is a chilling mombi and nicol williams is a rather hammy goblin king , albeit brought to the screen via some first rate clay animation . the music is also excellent - atmospheric , jolly at times , and eerie at other times . well worth catching , and a worthy companion piece to its predecessor .		8		1
not one of kubricks most famous films but for me this is superior visually to all but 2001 for style and elegance . filmed by candle light in many scenes , never has a historical epic been so intimate in drawing you into the world of the 18th century nobility , at times it feels like your actually at the card table with lyndon barry . the film shows the misadventures of lyndon barry , starting with a duel in ireland fought for love we follow barry 's journey through europe as and lover , as he quests for money and social standing becoming increasingly cold and calculating . in many ways the protagonist is thoroughly un-likable but by the end of the film we sympathise with him at least he took on the aristocracy and to see him brought low by a brat born to money is a shame . like an oil painting come to life the tone feels understated but never diminishes the power of the directors visual presentation , his roots in photography show through every frame of film seems obsessed over till as perfect as one of kubricks early photo shoots . technically this film is superb but at times it is unemotional and detached which can be disconcerting and due to the size of the book the film does make large time jumps . kubrick once said if it can be thought or written it can be filmed he proved it once again with this . 8/10		8		1
with its killer , amazing score , spectacular and innovative camera-work , and wonderfully gory murders , tenebre delivers everything you could ask for in a giallo . like many italian murder mysteries , the story takes some swallowing , but if you can accept the convoluted plot , there 's plenty of fun to be had . peter neal -lrb- anthony franciosa -rrb- is a best-selling novelist who becomes involved in real life murder mystery when the victims of a razor-wielding killer are found with pages from his latest book stuffed in their mouths . one of director dario argento 's best movies , tenebre is packed to the rafters with the kind of stuff that make good giallos such a trip to watch . as pretty girls are stalked and killed by a raspy-voiced maniac , the director offers genuine clues and red herrings aplenty , allowing the audience to have fun trying to figure out who the killer is . the movie 's stunning cinematography is accompanied by one of goblin 's greatest scores , transforming what may have been mundane moments in the hands of a lesser director into pure works of art -lrb- in one amazing scene the camera simply prowls slowly around the outside of a building , but with argento in control , it is simply breathtaking ! -rrb- . murder has never been so stylish , and even the most grisly deaths are stunningly captured . a particularly memorable moment has a young girl stumble into the house of the killer , before being chased through a garden ; this scene is shot from the axe-wielding maniac 's point of view , and is incredibly effective . fans of gore are also catered for with several gruesome murders , the best of which involves bucket-loads of arterial spray decorating most of a wall . juicy ! argento reveals the identity of the killer in a suitably silly finale -lrb- all gialli have them -rrb- , before offing the murderer in a fittingly gruesome manner . check out tenebre and witness one of the great works from one of italian horror 's finest .		8		1
i think that just about every poster on imdb since this movie came out 2 years ago has noted that even though people doubted daniel craig as a good james bond , he has proved in sensational fashion that he is a very worthy advisory to the james bond list of actors . as we see this new james bond we must look back and see how different the james bond films are with every new actor , there was george lazenby whose movie as j.b is not looked as at a great success , roger moore who brought the character some weird movies -lrb- moonraker probably the most out there for story lines -rrb- , timothy dalton who showed a darker bond , pierce brosnan who is a great bond especially his first film golden eye , but now we have an actor is has brought a more sean connery atmosphere to the bond genre , and has completely revamped it at the same time . the movie itself is extremely good . the film is a heavy for the best ever bond film and the way it is shot is very good . the film never fills boring even through its 2 and a half hour time period and really shows layers to james bond that were not previously there . also the ending is spectacular and i did not see it coming . that is also why he goes for revenge in the second film . the side characters are quite good too , from the eye bleeding bad guy , the new bond girl or m , the one who tries desperately to stop bond being bond . anyway it is that depth with its characters and actors and seems to hold up well . this is definitely a movie people who think the james bond series has gone down the hole in the past few years will enjoy immensely . overall , daniel c. is a great edition to the james bond team and i hope he is here to stay , i look forward to seeing `` of solace '' today and i hope it is as good as this one . i rate this 84 % .		8		1
the man in the iron mask , fresh off the massive success of titanic , we got the next movie starring huge heart throb leonardo dicaprio along with some of hollywood 's strongest male leads . including a couple of my favorite actors john malkovich and jeremy irons , so this was a movie i was looking forward to seeing , not to mention i was 13 at the time of this release and was totally in love with leonardo dicaprio , oh yes , good times . so of course this movie was love at first site with me , but as i grew up and watched the movie without my crush influence , i still found it to be a good solid movie . leonardo stays strong as his first duo role as king louis and philippe and proves he can stand up with the heavyweights of hollywood . jeremy and john together with leonardo had great chemistry and made the man in the iron mask a really good watchable movie . france is under the reign of king louis xiv , who is bankrupting the country with his unpopular wars . when starving peasants in paris start to riot for food , he responds by ordering his chief adviser , to send them rotten food . meanwhile , the king wallows in hedonistic luxury while seducing a parade of women . the legendary three musketeers have retired from their posts : aramis is now a priest of the jesuit order ; porthos is running a parisian brothel ; athos has a son named raoul who is just back from the war and ready to marry the girl he loves , christine . at a festival , the two lovers are greeted by an older d'artagnan , just before raoul can propose , the king 's eyes fall on christine . he arranges for raoul to be returned to combat and killed in a suicidal charge . in the wake of raoul 's death , aramis initiates a plot to overthrow the king with the help of his old comrades . only athos and porthos agree to the plan ; d'artangan refuses to betray his oath of allegiance . the three musketeers sneak into an island prison and arrange the escape of a mysterious prisoner : a man in an iron mask . philippe , the identical twin of king louis . while he looks indistinguishable from his brother , philippe is compassionate and gentle and the plan is to replace louis with philippe . while i 've expressed my love for john and jeremy , the true talent comes out in gabriel byrne 's performance as well as leonardo dicaprio . gabriel as d'artagnan was just beautiful , charming , dashing , and very charismatic . while the movie could have had a little better direction , in some ways this felt more like a made for tv film at times , just with the big names . i 'd say that 's the movie 's main flaw , but they were not given a big budget to make it into a great movie . also the fact that leonardo as philippe , they take the iron mask off his face and he 's still pretty ! eh , still i 'd highly recommend it , it 's the actors that make this movie very delightful to watch , one for all and all for one ... this movie is just tons of fun ! hey , that almost rhymes , i made a funny ! ok , there 's my cheesy joke , i 'm done , just watch the movie . 8/10		8		1

i do n't know much about business , but that does n't mean it 's hard to appreciate a good business movie . despite a few dumbed down bits , the company men , comes with a feeling of authenticity with some heart and decent performances from everybody . that is good enough for me . in a hundred minutes , the company men gives us a small taste of what the recession did to american business . it does so in a way that favours character over making anti-corporate statements . the movie chooses to zoom in on the lives of three sales executives and how they deal with job loss . i 've never been in love with ben affleck , but when he wants to , he can show some professionalism . in the company men he does just that , proving capable of hitting all the emotional notes when necessary , something i feel he missed in his previous film the town . the company men is actually a rather sad movie . it is only a hundred minute in length , but it feels longer . there is a good amount of talk , but nothing ever feels too contrived , wasted or unnecessary . is it a brilliant film ? no , but i can safely recommend it .		8		1
written and first staged in the 1930s , the children 's hour was master playwright lillian helman 's first great success . it also provoked a scandal : the story concerned two women who run a school for girls -- and who suffer scandal and personal tragedy when an unruly student accuses them of having a lesbian affair . the play was such a success that hollywood wasted little time in buying the film rights , but the material was too hot for the 1930s film industry ; the story was significantly rewritten into a fairly insipid love-triangle melodrama and was released under the title these three . it would be another thirty years before american film was ready to tackle the play head on . many critics have noted that the children 's hour is not about lesbianism , but about the power of a lie . there is some truth to this , for the entire plot rests on the child 's lie and its devastating effect . but helman was not a superficial writer : once the knife goes in , she twists it several times , first in a series of emotional revelations between the leading characters and finally in a portrait of society that attacks any one perceived as different in any way -- even to the point of driving them to death . some complain that this is merely another hollywood stereotype in which the gay character has to be punished by the film 's conclusion , but i disagree ; if anything , helman 's point remains as unfortunately valid today as it was in the 1930s and again in the 1960s . the cast ranges from solid to exceptional , and the supporting cast is exceptionally fine . fay bainter and hopkins , both legendary actresses , give truly memorable performances in supporting roles ; child actresses karen balkin and veronica cartwright also give remarkably powerful performances . and audrey hepburn and james garner are rock solid as school teacher karen wright and her beau dr. cardin . but the raw power of the film comes from shirley maclaine , who gives one of the most inspired performances of her career as school teacher martha dobie . in this case superlatives are not enough : no one who sees the film will easily forget her tortured , passionate performance . director william wyler tells the story with great simplicity and to tremendous effect . strongly recommended . gary f. taylor , aka gft , amazon reviewer		8		1
congratulations to mike leigh on this wonderful `` slice of life ' movie of a period in the lives of gilbert & sullivan . his attention to detail is amazing , many memorable shots of colour and scene formation , some like oil canvases in their perfection . i am a g & s fan so this helps in the overall enjoyment of the movie . the personality differences between the two principles were legendary and he has captured this and all the back stage preparation that contributes to the final perfect `` froth '' of an operetta . i also liked how he drew us into the personalities of quite a few of the more minor characters and did not hammer us over the head with some quick resolution . just people 's lives , some injured , some with destructive addictive habits , some with longing and frustration - very moving in most cases . in the last scene , i was moved to think that we all get to sing our song , whatever that song is , and then it is over and it is all too brief . i saw this one in the theatre about a year ago and last night on dvd and mike 's comments are self deprecating - all this fuss for the making of a film about a little operetta . but what movie making : we take a chapter out of a life and put it under a lens and derive some consolation in that our lives are not that bad , perhaps , or how can be make them a little more meaningful . bravo mike , you are one of the leading lights of today 's film makers and this one brings you to a new level . 8 out of 10 .		8		1
apparently shane carruth was partly inspired by ` the conversation ' in his directorial style - that 's clear enough , but i 've never had the patience to sit through ` the conversation ' . ` primer ' is much more gripping . it does n't talk down to the audience or employ overt stylistic tricks ; it 's more like a modern reality show following two inventors round , and the way they discover time travel is how it ` would ' be discovered ; by a couple of geeks in a garage . it 's a movie , of course , so things start to go wrong . but because the narrative is exclusively from abe 's -lrb- aaron 's ? -rrb- standpoint -lrb- though not pov -rrb- our confusion mirrors his , and we keep watching in the hope that everything will be resolved . identifying with abe is key to enjoying the film , not understanding the science , and fortunately he retains our sympathy to the end . there 's just enough information - and the voice-over is essential - for you to construct some version of the story in your viewing mind . the beginning with the four partners is a little overlong , and the development of the time machine only just happens in time , narrative-wise , but after that there 's continual suspense . and confusion , but the sort of confusion you get from intelligent movies , not badly written or directed ones . i particularly liked it when their writing starts to deteriorate - a beautifully placed humorous touch . the ending is slightly open , but makes sense . ` primer ' definitely takes you on a 77 minute journey if you let it , and to do that on $ 7000 is amazing . one thing - do you ` pull volts ' from a battery ? it 's amps , surely .		8		1
in 2004 , the middle-class family barrett travels to thailand to spend the holidays in a seaside resort . henry barrett -lrb- ewan mcgregor -rrb- is a family man that works in japan and maria -lrb- naomi watts -rrb- is a doctor but she does not work to raise their sons lucas -lrb- tom holland -rrb- , thomas -lrb- samuel joslin -rrb- and simon -lrb- oaklee pendergast -rrb- . they are surprised by the south asian tsunami and maria and lucas help each other and survive . however , maria is seriously wounded and there is a total lack of resources in the crowded hospital . meanwhile henry finds his two younger sons in a palm tree , leaves them is a shelter to seek out lucas and maria throughout a devastated country . `` lo impossible '' is a realistic spanish movie about the fate of a family in the tragic 2004 south asian tsunami with fantastic performances of tom holland and naomi watts that deserved the nomination not only to the oscar , but to other cinema festivals . the special effects are amazing and give the sensation that the naomi watts and tom holland have been really caught by the waters . my vote is eight . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` o '' -lrb- `` the impossible '' -rrb-		8		1
young christian bale offered a powerful performance in this drama about a young boy separated from his family after the japanese occupation of shanghai and sent to an internment camp , where he has to find a way to survive . bale 's portrayal of jamie -lrb- or jim -rrb- was the highlight of this movie . i thought he captured the boy 's confusion perfectly . raised in shanghai , as a child of privilege living in an opulent british enclave , jamie has lost touch with his british roots -lrb- as he notes at one point in the movie , he 's never even been to britain . -rrb- he admires the japanese and , although he never actually says this , one gets the impression that he 'd really like the japanese to win the war . at the same time , he becomes increasingly aware of the brutal treatment those interned with him are receiving at the the hands of their japanese captors . in the camp , jamie is befriended by basie -lrb- john malkovich -rrb- , an american prisoner with whom he establishes a somewhat complicated relationship . basie comes to treat him largely as an adult ; while jamie depends on him more and more . their friendship has its ups and downs , and malkovich also put on a good performance in the role . although the story is fictional , it struck me as a believable portrayal of something that could have happened . i had a little bit of trouble with the timeline . the first half of the movie is set obviously in late 1941 , just before and after the japanese attack , and then there is a sudden shift to 1945 in the last half of the movie . the intervening years are left out . one wonders about what life in the internment camp had been like in those intervening years . i found that omission of 3 plus years a bit jolting , although doing much with it would have made a long movie even longer . essentially , as i think back to the story , three scenes remain with me : -lrb- 1 -rrb- when jamie , looking for his toy plane , stumbles across the japanese soldiers ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- when jamie is separated from his mother -lrb- played by emily richard -rrb- ; and -lrb- 3 -rrb- the last scene of the movie , which i wo n't describe because i do n't want to spoil it . overall , i thought this movie was excellent . 8/10		8		1
the first time i ever heard about davey jones ' locker i was probably about eight years old and read about it in a ` mighty mouse ' comic book back in the 1950 's - i still remember the panel ! the story never really made it clear about the legend , so i sit here almost fifty years later thinking about that story and the film i saw today . whether the movie version bears any resemblance to the actual legend i still do n't know , but it made for a good flick , and a worthy sequel to the original `` pirates of the caribbean '' . the pace of the story is pretty quick , and i 'll admit that repeat viewings are necessary to catch the nuance between all the characters and events going on in an effort to retrieve the ` dead man 's chest ' . the nutshell version says that the owner of the chest and the beating heart of davey jones inside will rule the high seas . besides good old davey himself , there 's an entire boatload of characters setting their sights on the mythical treasure . the first appearance of johnny depp as ambiguous swashbuckler -lrb- ? -rrb- jack sparrow was quite clever utilizing the painted eyelid gimmick . the cannibal get away scene by jack gives new meaning to the term fruity pirate . i could n't help making comparisons to the frenetic pacing of an old time warner brothers cartoon with a number of scenes in the picture , and i think that was a positive for the movie . this is the type of picture one views strictly for entertainment value and on that score i was not disappointed . no need to go into any more detail . with only six days under it 's belt at the time of this posting , the movie is setting all kinds of records and has already elicited over eight hundred comments in this forum . the franchise is achieving a popularity awarded to only a few others , and with no pretense other than offering a whole lot of fun . hoist ye sails matey !		8		1
waitress has a charm all its own . the balance between comedy and drama has been accomplished without the traditional fancy one-liners but with more finesse of actual life performances , brilliantly performed by keri russell , an award nominating role and acting job . the drama is well played by jeremy sisto in an unsympathetic role and except for the ultimate direction keri and jeremy take in a somewhat oversimplified scripted episode , their relationship and performances are excellent . the lightness and the comedy that intersperse this small , intimate film about a wife burdened with a selfish husband and living a life as a waitress who loves to bake pies and discovers that she is pregnant is a meaningful film about facing up to one 's responsibilities and dreams . eight out of ten stars .		8		1
matthew mcconaughey gives a good performance in this courtroom drama , and is supported by an incredibly able cast . veteran character actors william h. macy and john leguizamo add class and excitement with excellent portrayals of the investigator and the referring attorney . the remaining cast rises to their level , so we have a cast of professionals giving us a polished and entertaining production . the fact that two of the most beautiful ladies in film are included does n't hurt . marisa tomei manages to keep her clothing on -lrb- unlike the wrestler -rrb- in spite of a torrid love scene with mcconaughey . and the absolutely beautiful frances fisher is incredible as the domineering mother of the accused who is footing the bill through her son . kudos to trace adkins for a small but well done performance as the leader of the motorcycle gang who has haller on retainer . -lrb- i guess no one is satisfied with just being an excellent singer and performer anymore . -rrb- overall , the film is fast paced , well edited , and entertaining , exactly what a good movie should be . rated r for violence , sexual innuendo , and language , this one is for the older teens and the adults . too much explaining for the rug rats . collectible ? not particularly , unless you are a fan of mcconaughey , tomei , or good courtroom drama .		8		1
a present for every boy who longed for something as good as `` animal house '' while suffering through the age of chris farley and jim carrey . this is n't quite as consistent as a accident john landis movie , but it has the best first half of any 90s comedy - free , wild , vicious , and delighted to be out from under era social constraints . cripples , drugs , whore sex , murder , race jokes . there 's no tom hanks at this bachelor party . a mostly disappointing third act manages to wrap up it up in the right spirit . altogether maybe my favorite movie of 1998 . i saw this in an audience of women , many of whom walked out , i guess because cameron diaz plays a bitch princess just a little too accurately for some people . diaz is n't in it much , but she 's better here than she often is , and while i do n't know her personally , she plays a shallow , selfish brat more convincingly than she does a cute , likable ingenue . the rest of the cast , with one exception , is fine . i mean , sure , christian slater 's part would have been better played by vince vaughan ; but slater 's no hack . leland orser 's weird as hell , daniel stern is reliable as always , john favreau is a straight man for the ages . and kobe tai is the best bachelor party stripper since nick the dick . but the exception is piven . he 's not fine . he 's a god . it 's piven 's film ; we 're all just watching it . jeremy piven was born to play an underachieving lout in movies -lrb- as he was born to play an overachieving lout on tv -rrb- , and peter berg makes the best cinematic use to date of this wonderful performer . his manic , , fratricidal characterization here is a high-water mark for the crazy buddy role . `` i 'm gon na do this and then we 're gon na go to '' has become a boys ' - night-out mantra . this film effectively exorcises the demon of pcu and places piven at the forefront of wack-job talent . it was one of the great injustices of hollywood that after this one failed to perform at the box office , berg did n't direct another movie for five years . now , after a couple of crowd-pleasing kids ' movies , let 's hope he writes something this dark again .		8		1
i have seen most of the family movies that have been considered `` very good '' by popular opinion and i must say that `` how to train you dragon '' may very well be one of the best . whether you are male or female , young or old , i believe that this picture will appeal to you . the action is very solid throughout the movie . the outline of the film is described early on and everything flows at a wonderful pace through the duration of the film . the plot is also one of the best things about this movie . i really like the idea of a nobody telling all of the big shots that they `` have it all wrong '' . hiccup 's character progression is done superbly throughout the story . he changes immensely , but it all makes a lot of sense . this movie does not lack action in it 's conclusion either . the final battle against the massive queen is reminiscent to a final battle in a video game . she is so big and powerful that she seems unstoppable . if you are privileged enough to see this in 3d , you will be treated to some great 3d action . i 've seen four or five movies in 3d now , including avatar , and without doubt , this takes advantage of the new 3d technology over anything else that i have seen . this movie has heart , compassion , intelligence , action , humor , and a terrific plot . one of the best animated family movies i 've seen in quite some time .		8		1
the coen brothers follow up their two last crime black comedies with a more light-hearted piece . the risk pays off . the film is silly and full of eccentric characters . the film is also more period oriented than any other coen film . it is full of convincing sets and a good amount of extras . roger deakins ' fantastic cinematography is a highlight , using color lenses for dramatic and comedic effect was one of the smartest decisions the coens made with this one . clooney , along with his two co-stars dominate every scene , even when the dialogue is a bit on the uncredible side . still a knock-out though , with lots of laughs and always entertainment value .		8		1
it ` s not often a 70s flick starring either sean connery or michael caine can be described as good , never mind great but the man who would be king is a great film . it ` s a good old fashioned romp set during britain ` s imperial past without a hint of cynicism , and with lashings of humour : '' corporal get three men and put him under close arrest . the bloody fool ` s drunk again '' . john huston keeps a solid hand at the director ` s helm and the scenery is breathtaking . and after watching this you ` ll be asking yourself why neither connery or caine didn ` t appear in more movies this good		8		1
`` king of new york '' is a gritty depiction of new york 's underworld crime . it does n't have the romantic or shakespearian feel of `` the godfather '' , nor the entertaining flamboyance of scorsese 's `` goodfellas '' , yet it has a little something that redeems all of these absences : a stroke of genius in the casting of its leading role . indeed , abel ferrara 's cult-classic features christopher walken in one of his most defining roles as a drug lord named frank white , a peculiar name as white happens to be the leader of a black gang lead by jump : fishburne , when he was still billed as larry . abel ferrara 's movies are never gratuitous exercises in style ; there is always a soul expressing an emotional or existential pain in his films . however , in `` king of new york '' , the soul we meet is in total peace with itself . according to frank , there is absolutely no contradiction between his ambition to be the mayor of new york and his criminal background . frank white believes in what he does with a remarkable strength and never apologizes for what he does , as he says `` i never killed anyone who did n't deserve it '' . only walken could have embodied this paradox without leaving its audience questioning it . i believed in frank because he believed in himself . he wanted to raise money to fund the building of a hospital , so be it , his lawyer happens to be one of his mistresses , he 's leading a gang of black leaders , maybe i would have questioned that if it was another actor , but there is something in walken 's eyes that inspires my total obedience . somewhere in the middle of the film , a chinese triad boss is watching `` nosferatu '' in a movie theater , and i never believe in coincidences when it comes to intelligent movies -- and this is one of them - . this subtle hint confirmed the first feeling i had about frank white , he has an extraordinary vampire-like quality conveyed by the icy eyes and somewhat ghostly look of walken . in my review of `` the funeral '' , i mentioned how walken ` had always an extraordinary combination of mental instability and charismatic aura in his eyes , the kind of man you do n't know if it 's safe to approach or to avoid him , in both cases , you respect and fear him ' . i guess this applies even better to `` king of new york '' . walken is walken at his best but his look is so ghostly in `` king of new york '' that i ca n't even take the name as a coincidence , he 's indeed extremely pale as if he was himself an incarnation of a soul that died in jail and waited to resurrect in its territory . frank white is rarely seen by day , and even then , he never leaves his car , equipped with black tainted windows , his car seems to highlight his presence , his absence , his direction whether he goes to the plaza hotel or when he tries to to escape from the police , a group of three officers from the narcotics police squad played by victor argo , david caruso and wesley snipes . but the car is also his privileged place , his throne , like the coffin for the vampire ; it 's not even a coincidence that white dies in a car , in the only place where he could both act and meditate on his actions . and i have the feeling that the hypnotizing effect of walken 's eyes and his ` robin hood ' quality contribute to build his sympathy . torn between the harsh reality of new york 's criminal underworld and his own vision , he became part-human , predator and prey , and like both , believes in territoriality and does n't let anyone undermine his path , not a mafia boss who frontally disrespects him , not a chinese gang leader who refuses a deal . you do n't say ` no ' to frank white . the sympathy we feel provokes the opposite feeling toward the cops who act as violently as the criminals and are portrayed in an unusually unsympathetic way . no good cop/bad cop , they 're all bad and maybe with the exception of argo , they seem eager to catch frank white as soon as he gets off the jail , with a fierce obsession . and their insistence is hinted when caruso comments on the gap between the criminals ' successes and their own lives . there seems to be a lot of frustration as if their actions were guided by jealousy more than a true desire to fight crime , as if the ugliness of the underworld affected their spirit . and never had crime looked indeed so ugly , when i look at the way gangster lifestyle is portrayed , i ca n't find any redeeming character in the film because there is precisely no room for any redemption . `` king of new york '' is only the chronicle of new york 's darkest side with frank white as the `` prince of darkness '' , walken , with this unique charisma . and it 's interesting that as we never question the motivations of white , we do n't question either the seemingly absence of plot in the film , we 're just invited to follow the rise and the demise of a man who had a dream while many aspects of the stories , many questions are left without answers . what happened to the gang that was told to come to the plaza ? what was the secret relationship between the two cops ? and some of the names could get easily mixed up ... in a way , the film betrays many golden rules of screen writing , that everything should lead somewhere or have a point . in `` king of new york '' , ferrara cares less about conventions but insists on showing new york 's criminal life with a gripping and documentary-like realism that confines to , signing an artistic unconventional masterpiece . at the end , we do n't want to become gangsters , but we 're not sure we would love to be cops either . or maybe we would love to be like frank white , a character so unreal that we can think of him as a guilty fantasy , forgivable because obviously inaccessible ...		8		1
`` the constant gardener '' , a novel by john lecarre dared to point a finger to what he saw as a big problem in the pharmaceutical industry with its experiments on humans by giving unsuspecting patients medicine that have not been proved effective and that could cause death . fernando mireilles picks up where mr. lecarre left off with the film version of the novel that was adapted by jeffrey caine . `` the constant gardener '' is a disturbing film about what goes on behind the scenes . mr. mereilles has directed a film that , while has its heart in the right place , as others have commented in this forum , can be seen as preachy , at best . the other aspect of the film makes a thriller out of it when justin quayle , the meek british working for the government and based in africa sees his young wife and her assistant brutally killed and that is when he takes the matter into his hands . the film will satisfy most viewers because the action never stops and mr. mireilles has done wonders to get us involved in all he is showing on the screen . ralph fiennes makes justin quayle come alive . rachel weisz is also up to task with her take on tessa . however , the big surprise is dennis huston who plays the duplicitous sandy woodrow with great style . the excellent bill nighy is seen only in a couple of key scenes . the rest of the cast does good work under the director 's guidance . `` the constant gardener '' is a film that makes one think about what happens to the poor people suffering from disease and are in effect guinea pigs in the process .		8		1
one of the last great silent films this is a german movie that is surprisingly short on cinematic expressionism and long on the glamorous , sultry , hypnotic beauty of louise brooks . it is her dynamic performance and fallen goddess looks that makes her , and by attachment pandora 's box , a wonder to behold . the thematic sexual content is handled with reverence rather than raunchiness and it is her glorious , giddy , and sincere playful naive nature that is compelling . she not only , just by proximity , seduces any man in close contact , as well as the audience with a childish charm of calming cuteness but unleashes primal desire as well as a protective desire manifested by her magnetism . the film is long and deeply depressing but it carries us through to her inevitable descent and destruction with so much pathos that it is hard to detach oneself from her destiny and want this obviously playful , not , soul to live happily ever after . but this is not a fairy-tale and she is not snow white . this is greek tragedy .		8		1
from here to eternity will always be remembered for burt lancaster and deborah kerr 's kiss in the waves . what viewers should also remember is the acting from all the principle characters and secondary characters . there is not a flawed performance from anyone . montgomery clift is perfectly stubborn and frank sinatra is loud but likeable . ernest borgnine brings a quiet menace to the role of fatso judson . the scene where sinatra is brought into the stockade shows the menace and joy in 's eyes and the fear in sinatra 's . deborah kerr and donna reed are the women who fall in love with soldiers . kerr has a loveless relationship with her husband and falls for lancaster 's no nonsense sgt. warden . reed loves clift , but they can never know true love . clift loves the army , and he 's too stubborn and proud to ever bow before anyone . set against the backdrop of hawaii before the bombing of pearl harbor , the film remains a timeless classic of epic , but doomed romance .		8		1
dark city is a film that should get more recognition . after watching it several times i am convinced that it 's one of the best films of the 1990s and one of the best science fiction films ever . it flows well from scene to scene . the cinematography is gorgeous . one of the strangers mentions that the city was created from different eras of human history . in this bustling metropolis exist vintage cars , , tall old style buildings , and the people wear 1930 fashion . all this contributes to a city that is fascinating to look at . the story is also interesting . it revolves around what makes people human . is it just our memories or is there more to it ? many human conditions are represented in the film . the characters fit in well with the story . william hurt plays inspector frank bumstead , a man who 's lonely and obsessed with little details . almost all characters are played by famous actors . jennifer connelly plays john murdoch 's beautiful brunette wife , and there 's also a woman -lrb- melissa george -rrb- , who takes a liking to murdoch , who 's a pretty blonde . what 's important is that these people are n't there just for show . they all play important roles , and they 're all different and well-rounded characters . there 's a lot to like about the film . the score is fitting , and there are two good vocals songs ; sway and the night has a thousand eyes . every scene is well thought-out and filmed . what i liked most about dark city though is that it 's a science fiction film noir . it 's a great film too . it 's more coherent than blade runner -lrb- 1982 -rrb- . dark city influenced the matrix -lrb- 1999 -rrb- . both were filmed at fox studios in sydney using some of the same sets . comparisons have been made between scenes from the films , making note of similarities in both cinematography and atmosphere , as well as the plot . but dark city is a better film . i give it my highest recommendation .		8		1
throughout force of evil , something bothersome keeps nagging away . at first , it seems to be the film 's considerable artifice -- the freighted `` blank verse '' dialogue , the dark , ominously composed shots , the adroitly modulated score , the sudden eruptions of violence . but cumulatively it becomes clear that we 're responding not so much to artifice as artificiality -- the sense that writer-director abraham polansky is hovering just offscreen , pulling all the strings . it remains quite an achievement nonetheless . a filial drama , it runs along the love/hate ties that bind brothers john garfield and thomas gomez . gomez , 50 and ailing , runs a tenement policy bank that takes in nickels and dimes . young upstart garfield rakes in tens of thousands as a wall street lawyer with connections to an underworld syndicate . just before the fourth of july -- when the racket has been rigged to break the small-time operators by ensuring that the number will hit -- garfield 's guilty conscience leads him into warning off his brother , triggering a catastrophic chain of events . polansky does n't bother to hide his world view . it 's one thing to depict the bosses of crime and finance as heartless louses , but it does n't ring true to have the and policy workers display their decency and dignity at every turn . we know marie windsor is a wicked woman when she glides smoothly into the lights keeping her voice so low and silky we have to strain to catch what duplicity she 's up to . garfield 's signature torment reaches such a perfervid boil here that we wonder why he ended up on wall street , not a . still , the melodrama crackles , and the cast plays to the hilt -lrb- this is gomez ' shining moment in the noir cycle -- not a lackey nor an ogre , he 's a mensch at the crossroads -rrb- . film noir emerged , at least in part , in response to a brutally fractured world . whatever `` messages '' the movies contained were implicit and often inchoate . force of evil misreads the cycle 's cool , suggestive style by mounting its arguments so . it 's a swift and brutal work that reminds us to eat our peas once or twice too often .		8		1
tony -lrb- bourne franchise scripter -rrb- gilroy , directing as well as writing this time , strives for a kind of disheveled moral grandeur in this thriller about corporate lawyers who slowly turn on the chemical company u/north , which one of their ace partners has been defending against a $ 9 million class action lawsuit for six years . this is arthur -lrb- tom wilkinson -rrb- , a man with a `` chemical imbalance '' who goes off his medication and has a psychotic break -lrb- his role 's been compared to peter finch 's in the 1976 ` network ' -rrb- -- thus temporarily concealing from his associates the fact that he 's found damning evidence and has gone over , quite rationally and determinedly , to the class action side . michael clayton , the law firm 's corporate fixer or bailout man -lrb- `` , '' he prefers to call it -rrb- is summoned to rescue arthur and smooth things over with u/north . but arthur 's meltdown at a in minneapolis draws the attention of karen crowder -lrb- tilda swinton -rrb- , the chemical firm 's general counsel . in gilroy 's somewhat sexist portrait , she 's seen constantly pondering her outfits and practicing her public lines . no such self-doubt from the law firm 's main partner , manny -lrb- sydney pollack -rrb- . gilroy 's idea of corporate lawyers turning into whistle blowers -lrb- michael 's family origins -- irish catholic cops -- come in handy -rrb- makes for a drama that holds the attention . one wonders how it would have played without wilkinson 's flashy acting , swinton 's proved skill at playing the evil sprite or wicked witch , or clooney 's matinée idol glamor . you can call this a down-and-dirty role for george , but it 's really much less so than the one he had in ` syriana . ' this drama hovers , sometimes successfully , sometimes a bit uneasily , between the team 's edgy stuff and their pop money-makers . clayton wears dark suits -lrb- at all times -rrb- and expensive swiss watches , drives a sleek new black company mercedes , and can bum $ 80,000 off manny to pay his debts from a failed venture -- and still have a fews thousand left over to indulge his high-stakes gambling habit . even his failings are glamorous , and he has a dashing final scene where he brings the bad guys quickly to their knees . it 's one of several wonderfully cinematic moments by gilroy , who has jumped into the hollywood directorial a-list with this debut -- depending on box office receipts , that is ; but the critical reception is looking good . people get , then killed ; one attempt fails . the plot pins all the bad stuff on crowder ; incredibly , she takes decisions without needing approval from above . these are larger-than-life portraits , with some fudging of details , some incredible strokes of luck -- and too much loud portentous music from an annoying soundtrack constantly telling us how important and climactic every scene is . still , gilroy knows how to tell an action story , and i do n't buy that this is a knockoff of a 70 's muckraking movie . gilroy 's into something different . it 's original of him to focus on a lawsuit without even entering a courtroom , showing a deposition -lrb- the key document is a scientist 's report from fifteen years before that that the u/north ceo signed off on -rrb- -- making the main lawyers either half-crazy -lrb- arthur -rrb- or essentially canny businessmen -lrb- manny -rrb- or mop-up guys who can make a deal about just about anything -lrb- michael -rrb- . `` the truth can be adjusted '' is the movie 's slogan , a transparently ironic one . truth can be adjusted -- until it ca n't . maybe ; maybe not . but is n't it pretty to think so -- that the truth will out , even in corporate law ? there is an element of feel-good manipulation throughout this slick tale , but it 's caviar to the general : it assumes the mainstream audience is n't made up of neanderthals , after all .		8		1
i just saw this movie with my parents . my dad complained about the title character 's lines saying they 're more likely to come from an adult than from an actual teenager . my mom just seemed to like the wittiness of the whole movie . during much of the beginning , i was ready to agree how overrated and pretentious some of this movie was based on reading many of the comments i 've scanned through here . but while not every pop-culture reference was funny and i half wondered how many viewers would get the comparisons of dario to herschell gordon lewis -lrb- with a scene from one of his movies , to boot ! -rrb- , i was enthralled by the various relationships between the characters and actors and the way they mainly flowed under jason reitman 's direction of diablo cody 's oscar-winning screenplay . while ellen page also deserved her academy award nom as best actress , the most compelling performances to me were the potential adoptive parents played by jason bateman and especially jennifer garner . as an `` arrested development '' fan , it 's also a little strange seeing bateman and his tv son michael cera here and yet since they 're not related in this film , they do n't have any scenes together . but that 's not too much distraction to me . add in j. k. simmons as juno 's father and allison janney as her stepmother and this movie is nearly perfect . there 's also an amusing turn by rainn wilson in the beginning . while perhaps not a great lesson on pregnancy and its choices , juno does manage to consider there are such choices . all considered , this movie is mostly enjoyable enough that i may consider seeing it again sometime soon .		8		1
in a city full of believers , it seems most strange that visiting non-believers are all foreigners . people raised in the teachings of the catholic church may find this film a reinforcement to their literal indoctrination . the title of this dark dramatic movie directed by mikael hafstrom is called '' the rite '' and deals with or spiritual possession by satanic demons . the original idea or foundation stems from a book written by matt baglio and deals with michael kovak -lrb- colin o'donoghue -rrb- a young man who was raised by his father -lrb- rutger hauer -rrb- to become a mortician . joining the ministry to become a catholic priest , michael feels compelled to resign from the church . he is dissuaded by father xavier -lrb- ciaran hinds -rrb- not to quit until he visits an exorcist named father lucas trevant -lrb- anthony hopkins -rrb- in rome . there he confronts both his doubts and his fears having to do with people who have been or still are possessed by black demons . the movie is amply filled with terrifying scenes of the occult , nightmarish apparitions and malevolent spirits . if audience members are a bit squeamish or have a low threshold on their courage , this film is not recommended . if on the other hand , one wants to confront the source of their fears , this is the film for you . hopkins is superbly powerful in his role and so too his cast members . well done ! ****		8		1
the sisterhood of the traveling pants -lrb- if you have n't read the novel by ann brashares -rrb- sounds like another silly , goofy chick flick , a made for summer popcorn movie for teenage girls to love and teenage boys to tolerate . but the title should not prevent the general audience from experiencing a truly tender , warm , balanced film about four teenage girlfriends bonded by a magical pair of jeans . there are four stories here , each centered on the summer experiences of the four girls who go off in different directions and discover a lot about themselves and life : lena -lrb- alexis bledel -rrb- follows family ties to greece , encountering ` tradition vs love ' with kostas -lrb- michael rady , a newcomer whose looks and screen presence bode well for a fine career ! -rrb- ; bridget -lrb- blake lively -rrb- finds a balance of love and soccer in mexico ; carmen -lrb- america ferrera -rrb- explores family ties and body image in a new stepmother ; tibby -lrb- amber tamblyn -rrb- works the summer in ` ' and pursues her passion for documentary film-making which just happens to include a real life drama . so why do these simple tales make a movie ? each of the girls represents the delicate issues that teenagers encounter as they move into adulthood , and the manner in which director ken kwapis intertwines these stories through the common bond of the four girls ' friendship works on every level . there is a sense of fresh talent , fresh writing , fresh direction , and sensitive acting that make this movie one to be recommended to a large audience . a fine little coming of age film . grady harp , october 05		8		1
even though she portrayed variations of the same demonic character in 1989 's `` she-devil '' and 1992 's `` death becomes her '' , meryl streep truly nails it in this smart , creative 2006 comedy by underplaying the role and saving her verbal talons for pivotal moments . as miranda priestly , the despotic editor-in-chief of runway magazine , streep simply singes the screen every time she appears with her perfectly hair ; arrogant couture opinions and frequently unreasonable demands on her staff . fortunately , director david frankel has come along well since his 1995 woody allen knockoff , the irritatingly unctuous `` miami rhapsody '' , and one can see his progression in his smart work on episodes of `` sex in the city '' and `` entourage '' . he moves the film at such a sharp , fast clip that it feels like an accurately frenzied portrayal of the inner workings of the world of haute couture . the one-line zingers also come fast and furious thanks to aline brosh mckenna 's script based on lauren weisberger 's best-selling novel , but the vitriol does not come at the expense of character development and a shrewdly observed storyline about all-or-nothing careers when working for media royals and courtiers . the plot 's protagonist is not priestly but andy sachs , a young idealist and aspiring journalist who just graduated from northwestern . even though she has no interest in fashion , she lands an interview at runway . because she is not a typically , anorexic fashionista toady , priestly hires her as her second assistant . it becomes a nightmarish trial by fire , as andy slowly earns the trust of priestly much to the chagrin of the haughty first assistant emily . and despite the derision of her circle of friends , including her live-in boyfriend , sachs starts to respect priestly 's style and power , which leads to the decision to have andy go to paris for fashion week . further complications ensue when a hotshot writer takes an interest in her and a power struggle erupts at runway . it really takes someone of streep 's caliber to pull off the impossible character of priestly because when she does have a moment of vulnerability , it resonates so much more than it should . although she is far too pretty to be considered frumpy by anyone 's standards , the naturally likable anne hathaway plays sachs and looks sensational in a series of chanel outfits . she brings the necessary heart to the story , even though the character arc is rather predictable . it does seem a shame that we are supposed to cheer the character 's reduction from size 6 to 4 , but that is probably as accurate as anything else in the film . there is terrific work from the reliable stanley tucci as nigel , runway 's no-nonsense fashion director , especially as he patiently works under priestly 's shadow and gives sachs hard-to-take survival advice , and from emily blunt , who plays first assistant emily with the ideal combination of vitriol and desperation . overly with the strangest blond eyebrows i have ever seen , simon baker lends an appropriately smarmy edge to his writer christian thompson . far less interesting are sachs ' judgmental friends , in particular adrian as sachs ' sous-chef boyfriend and tracie thoms as art gallery owner lilly . the ending is inevitable , but it moves in a creative way that makes neither sachs overly heroic nor priestly absolutely villainous . this is solid entertainment elevated by the artistry of streep .		8		1
alternately puzzled , lost , desperate , lonely , confused and unexpectedly radiant with happiness , marilyn monroe , with a mixture of humor and pain scores her greatest triumph in joshua logan 's `` bus stop '' creating a complete and deeply touching character ... singing ` that old black magic ' to a noisy crowd of cowpokes who could n't care less about her efforts to entertain them , cherie is pleased to discover a fan in bo , a young and innocent cowboy who has come to make his fortune at the rodeo and finds himself an angel to take back to his montana ranch ... the kiss she gives him in appreciation , determines him then and there to be his beloved wife ... logan gives don murray his first and best-remembered screen role , as the gauche cowboy who romances the glamorous ` ' ... marilyn succeeds in making him say `` please '' which is the point of the whole thing ... murray was oscar-nominated for his performance ... there are other fine performances in the movie : arthur o'connell , delightful as the cowboy 's pal who him with loving patience ; eileen heckart amusing as the old time friend ; betty field , strong enough as the bus stop owner ; robert bray , firm as the driver of the bus and hope lange , so auspicious in her screen debut whom cherie reveals details of her past ... with a modern western background and rodeo atmosphere , and with panoramic long shot and overwhelming close-ups in color and cinemascope , `` bus stop '' is a comedy-drama very well done , and a modest entertainment in familiar american vein ... the film had one of monroe 's most touching songs : ` that old black magic ' was as funny as it was heartbreaking ...		8		1
the movie-making team of simon pegg , nick frost , and edgar wright has been one of the biggest success stories of british cinema of the past decade . with `` shaun of the dead '' -lrb- 2004 -rrb- and `` hot fuzz '' -lrb- 2007 -rrb- , the trio demonstrated originality , ingenuity , and most significantly , capable of drawing a large , appreciative audience . now they 're back with the long-awaited third movie of what 's become unofficially known as the `` cornetto trilogy . '' like it 's predecessors , director edgar wright loves paying homage to american cinema ; `` shaun '' pays its respects to george romero , `` fuzz '' nods its head to over the top action , buddy flicks , and `` world 's end '' takes a page from our classic american sci-fi films . in `` the world 's end , '' 20 years after attempting an epic pub-crawl , five childhood friends reunite when one of them becomes hell-bent on trying the drinking marathon once again . once convinced to stage an encore by gary king -lrb- simon pegg -rrb- , a 40-year - old man trapped in the mindset of his mid 20 's , drags his reluctant friends back to their hometown , and once again attempt to reach the fabled pub - the world 's end . `` the world 's end '' plays on the notion that any time you return to your old stomping grounds , changes are inevitable . upon returning to their small town roots -- a place so boring it boasts about having the first roundabout in all of england -- the crew notices that things are a little strange . as it turns out , the town residents are now blue - blooded alien robots . pretty soon , the group of friends find they are not only fighting to recapture who they once were , but to preserve who they are . `` the world 's end '' follows similar thematic and structural paths as the other films in the trilogy . while it is definitely intended as a satirical spoof on one level , it also works just as well as a fully functional sci-fi story . you have elements of body snatching , invasions , and more than a few overt nods to john carpenter 's classic `` they live '' -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , in the way the aliens integrate into their society and take over . it 's satire in such a loving fashion that it comes across as infectiously charming . if there is anything to criticize here , maybe it 's that the genre is a bit more skewered and less defined than in its predecessors . however , `` the world 's end '' does cap an unofficial trilogy , and the grievance is overly critical given the nature of the movies . long-time fans of the trilogy will appreciate the reversal of roles , casting pegg as the selfish screw-up , and frost as the one who has it together . this allows pegg to fully unleash his gift for gab , and for frost to show off his considerable skill for physical comedy . with great gags , better fights , and fan pleasing cameos , `` the world 's end '' is exactly the sort of , genre-blending pleasure we 've come to expect from its creative trio , and we can only anticipate to what the future holds .		8		1

tron : legacy is the perfect saturday night movie -lrb- at least for me -rrb- . it is well pace with enough action and visually stunning ; though story wise i wo n't complain much -- it was n't bad that one can not accept it . for me it was a perfect pop-corn movie that one can sit , relax and enjoy it with one 's friends from the beginning to the very end . i have n't seen the original tron but having seen the trailer i can only imagine it must have come a long way and how much the technology have change . anyway the movie was a pure entertainment . i almost love every moment of it and there does n't seem to be quite a dull moment . -lrb- added maybe because the movies i rented for the past months has been more or less disappointing ; making this movie to be more favorable . -rrb- story wise it was n't anything special , two guys got trap in computer world - the world they have created themselves which turn backfire on them , now they must find they way out or being hunt down in the virtual world . the only problem here was the lack of characters development despite the fact that there already few characters . but i 'm not gon na complain . this movie also needs to give credit to its cast - it was brilliant - garrett hedlund as sam was surpassing my expectation -- he fitted the role too well , olivia wilde as quorra is probably the best thing in the movie -- she was not only hot with stylish short hair and skin tight suit but her performance as iso -lrb- you need to watch movie to understand this -rrb- was also very good . jeff bridges in double role was also great . for the first feature film i must say joseph kosinski has done absolutely brilliant job in putting in everything together . the movie is visually stunning , and the cgi was totally awesome -- especially making jeff bridge look 35 year old and still so believable is marvelous . the $ costumes also add to brilliant visual effect . plus the score by daft punk fit the movie too well . anyway i had a great time watching this movie , and if you do enjoy sci-fi genes then you should definitely check this out . it is one of the good sci-fi movies out there . recommendation : yes ! worth every penny to buy its dvd . rating :8 / 10 -lrb- grade : b + -rrb-		8		1
a few aspects of the film are actually quite good . tyler mane is a great michael myers . he 's almost seven feet tall and is built like a giant . he 's a total monster and the destruction and mayhem he causes is believable given his size . the adult version of michael myers is spot-on for a re-imagining of the film . malcolm mcdowell also does a good job as dr. loomis . he 's no donald pleasance , but mcdowell 's take on the character is n't bad . scout taylor-compton is also a worthy mention . she slips into the shoes of a modern day laurie strode rather flawlessly . moving on from the acting though , the film is pretty solid from the time michael gets his iconic mask through the finale . the way michael made so many masks while he was in smith 's grove was an interesting idea and the scene where you see his room fifteen years later with nothing but masks on every wall is one of the best in the film . the cinematography is also something that is often overlooked , which is a shame since it 's actually pretty exceptional . it seemed to stand out most during the scenes where michael was stalking laurie , especially in the abandoned myers house at the end . there 's a scene right after michael gets out of smith 's grove where he goes to a truck stop and winds up getting the jumpsuit we 're all familiar with . while there , he runs into big joe grizzly in the bathroom stall and is banging grizzly 's hand , which is holding a knife , against the bathroom stall wall . as he 's doing this though , the bathroom stall is just getting demolished but with every smashing blow , the camera violently shakes . the camera just always seemed to have a knack for giving a good perspective of what the character was going through , whether it was michael or laurie . the disappointing part of this is pretty much everything leading up to michael getting his mask back after his escape is pretty terrible . the dialogue , especially in the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film , is horrendous . everything that 's said between deborah myers and ronnie white is just awful . the white trash upbringing just does n't seem worthy for a horror icon like michael myers . it 's just hard to believe that michael myers is the way he is because his mom was a stripper and his older sister was a whore . logic seems to just be thrown by the way side as the film progresses . after michael escapes from smith 's grove , he returns to his old house where his mask and knife that he used to kill his family happen to just be lying under the floorboards . so did the police just pick up the bodies without searching the house or what ? so he got his jumpsuit by stealing it from a guy taking a dump at a truck stop ? really ? hearing some of the original music return from john carpenter 's version of the film was a bit bittersweet . on one hand , it was great hearing it again . on the other , however , it just did n't seem to fit . made me miss the original film more than anything . giving michael myers a specific origin was probably zombie 's biggest mistake . the most terrifying thing about michael myers was that he was the shape and had a bit of mystery to him . you knew he was going after laurie , but other than that you had loomis ' word to fall back on . michael was the human incarnation of pure evil . that 's it . that 's all you need . humanizing the character and introducing us to his childhood only watered down the michael myers character . there 's a scene with michael myers and dr. loomis in smith 's grove sanitarium where michael has made a mask that he 's colored completely black . when loomis asks him why it 's black , michael says that it 's his favorite color . loomis goes into an explanation about the color spectrum . black is on one end and is the absence of color while white is at the opposite end and is every color . that 's actually a great explanation of the differences between the original film and the remake . the original film would be the black segment of the spectrum . carpenter 's version leaves more to the viewer 's imagination as the only explanation for michael myers is that he is `` pure evil . '' while the remake would be the white segment of the spectrum as it goes into full detail why michael myers is the way he is and it shows every little violent and vulgar detail . some people would say that having a little bit of mystery would be a good thing when it comes to a film like this while others like having everything laid out for them . it all depends on the viewer and which end of the spectrum they prefer . in my opinion though , that 's the biggest mistake rob zombie made . there 's no mystery left with the michael myers character . he 's no longer the shape , but is a psychopathic killer because he was raised by a white trash family , liked to torture animals , and whose sister did n't take him trick or treating .		5		0
*** spoilers *** *** spoilers *** 1997 was a great year for british films -lrb- and i won ` t get into an argument with what constitutes a '' british '' film -rrb- with the full monty , bean and spice world all being massive hits in the us . strangely the british made film event horizon probably had a bigger budget than its three compatriots put together but made little impact on the american box office if i was to point out the cause for its failure then i would say it ` s with philip eisner ` s script . it lacks a lot in both characterisation and story development , things happen without much explanation and at times it ` s all slightly confusing . of course if there ` s been as much as 20 minutes cut out of the final print then that ` s hardly eisner ` s fault , but he should take the blame for the unoriginal script ***** may contain minor spoilers ***** the whole concept of a haunted space craft is no different to that of a haunted house , the start of event horizon reminded me of both 2001 and alien . , people being confronted by their worst fears is straight out of 1984 , a space ship that ` s alive is a reference to quatermass and the pit , and the villain ` s appearance resembles pinhead being converted to cenobite at the start of hellraiser 2 : hellbound . even the context of the dialogue is borrowed from other sources '' be with me '' is from lifeforce , and '' i have such sights to show you '' is hellraiser again . but luckily no one comes out with the cliche '' it ` s all right , there ` s nothing to worry about , everything is under control '' because that would be too self referential ***** end spoilers **** paul anderson does a fairly good job as director -lrb- has anyone noticed that anderson wouldn ` t know a good script if he saw one . maybe someone plucked his eyes out too ? -rrb- and it ` s on the technical areas the film works best , there ` s plenty of scenes that will make you jump out of your seat due to the sound mix . if anderson has a problem with event horizon then it ` s that he seems unable to get the best out of his cast , only sean pertwee gives a good performance as a rough and ready space pilot , everyone else on the ship seems to be half asleep . so if you like sci-fi or horror films then you may like event horizon , but it ` s not a film you ` re likely to watch over and over again which is a shame . a disappointing film to have come out of britain during a commercial golden age of british films		5		0
first things first : this is not a good movie . frankly , i 'm surprised it even received theatrical distribution , or that the studio behind it was supposedly ` disappointed ' when it absolutely bombed opening weekend . everything about it reeks of straight-to-dvd , from the quality of the photography itself to the writing to the performances -lrb- i mean , when your movie has christian slater in a supporting role in 2013 , what else would you expect ? -rrb- . that all said , it 's kinda fun . it 's fun in the way those unassuming '80s action comedies can be amusing when you catch them on tv late at night . this is not a movie i 'd go out of my way to watch , but it 's good for when you come home drunk on a weekend and want to nod off to something basic on tv . sly stallone 's character is named jimmy -lrb- which provides unintentional laughs -rrb- , a hit-man who teams up with an asian cop to take down some bad guys . the plot does n't matter , and is ridiculous -lrb- the cop risks his career when he does n't intervene while he sees stallone kill endless guys right in front of him , and even participates in a kidnapping -rrb- . i do n't even want to waste time writing too much about this movie . it 's disposable . but you know what ? i had more fun watching it than the expendables movie , because it is n't really trying to be something that it ai n't . -lrb- expendables was borderline parody of '80s action films , but particularly the last one was made in such a blockbuster fashion that it felt like they were trying to have their cake and eat it too , or whatever ; i just did n't really enjoy them that much . -rrb- i guess the only thing that kinda sucks about this movie -lrb- besides the fact that it sucks -rrb- is that walter hill was involved , and that it was supposed to be his ` comeback . ' it does n't feel like a hill film , necessarily , though i guess it 's similar to red heat . he 's capable of better -lrb- and there were rumours he was removed from the editing room in post-production , which i 'm liable to believe -rrb- , but whatever : this movie is what it is , it fulfills it well enough -lrb- since the standards for what it is are n't particularly high -rrb- , and if you ever catch it on tv late at night there are more boring things you could choose to watch .		5		0

recap : to escape her parents kitty enters a marriage with the shy medical researcher walter . but she does n't love him , but finds attraction with shanghai 's viceroy charlie . they have an affair seemingly without walter knowing , but one day he tells her that she is to come with him to a village far inland where he will fight an outbreak of cholera , or he will divorce her . when she finds that she was just a fling for charlie she reluctantly agrees . they enter a long journey where kitty finds her utterly alone , and especially so in her marriage , and without anything to do . and around them a potentially violent nationalist movement are spreading . comments : despite the harsh conditions , both in the country around them and in the marriage between them , it is actually quite a beautiful story , and hence movie . the scenery helps a lot with that , as some scenes are set in the most spectacular surroundings . that is not to say it is a happy story , it is rather sad and told in a slow pace . even though it is a turbulent time the movie is really about the relationship between kitty and walter . how a shaky marriage turns ice cold after kitty 's adultery and how the two spouses try to handle it . but the movie 's pace is slow and neither of the two characters are acting very sympathetic , i found it hard to really get involved and care for the movie . it was good , the acting was good , the story good , but it never got exciting . it was n't like i cared if i missed a minute or two , because i knew i would n't miss anything important and if i did , i did n't really actually care . for me it lacked something . a little quicker pace perhaps , some more dramatic events or outside pressure , or more of an intense cold war between them . now they were mostly just unhappy . and misery gets old pretty quickly . something for those who really likes movies about relationships , other than the ordinary romantic comedies , and maybe relay like to study characters . but not really for me . 5/10		5		0
dangerous small town kid grows up to be a crazed murderer and strikes on halloween night - but we already knew that . rob zombie 's remake of john carpenter 's 1978 horror classic differs greatly from the original film . not so much in storyline , though we are given lots of back story and some new plot twists , but zombie 's film really lacks the subtle charms of the original . my main complaint here is that we are n't given a likable character in the whole movie . let 's face it , if you ca n't even like the ` good guys ' who are we afraid for here ? the characters in this remake are so , unrealistic , and obnoxious -lrb- i 'm not even referring to the villains here -rrb- that they severely weaken the films impact . however maybe you wo n't notice that with all the gore and sex that 's thrown in . though granted i 've never been overly impressed by zombie 's films , and this one is no exception , i will still give him props because i personally like the guy -lrb- he has great taste in films and i love to see him host tcm underground -rrb- and this was an amusing 're - imagining ' even with its flaws . cast-wise the performances are very uneven , sheri moon zombie is probably the best as the mother of michael myers . it 's nice to see such familiar faces as malcolm mcdowell , brad dourif , dee wallace , ken foree , and udo kier in the cast . so horror fans , if you dig the z man - you 'll probably get behind this remake . however , myself being a die-hard carpenter fan , i ca n't really give this much more praise than i would an average slasher flick . ** out of ****		5		0
somewhere in here there was once a very funny script , from which we have received this flat , uninspired , dull movie that 's only occasionally funny . but does n't it look funny on the outside ? edward norton and robin williams are always fun to watch , you say , and danny devito brought the world `` the war of the roses , '' and `` throw momma from the train . '' right ? well , all that 's true at first glance . but those two devito films are nearly ten years old at this point , and while norton , and williams , and catherine keener all turn in excellent performances , the glue holding it together is all too weak , and every other actor -lrb- with the exception of the leader of the irish mafia -rrb- is incredibly miscast . the comic timing is off , the cinematography is nothing special -lrb- he has fewer movies to his credit so he must 've been cheap -rrb- , the songs are sometimes funny , sometimes grating . great script , but it should 've stayed on the shelf another few years . there are more creative directors who could have turned this into something far more clever , or far more funny -- devito bungled `` matilda '' a few years ago too , so he 's clearly lost his edge -- but `` death to smoochy '' only managed to get halfway there . 5/10 .		5		0

grease 2 is one of the most ridiculed sequels of all time , and though it pales to the original , its certainly better than the rating would imply . the film is just more musical numbers and hijinks from the kids at rydell high . only this time , the new kid on the block is a guy trying to impress a cool chick . as opposed to a goody-two-shoes girl trying to win over a cool guy like we saw in the original . there are some cute songs and funny moments , but the two leads -lrb- caulfield and pfeiffer -rrb- just can not live up to olivia newton-john or john travolta . not even close . first of all , neither can sing terribly well , and generally you 'd like your leads in a musical to be able to sing . it really helps . caulfield is somewhat more likable in the underdog role , but pfeiffer 's acting is really poor . she was a pretty face and little more at that point of her career . her song `` cool rider '' is one of the film 's worst . while singing it , she does look kind of sexy while climbing up to the top of a ladder and then straddling it . but then when she gets down she starts doing something resembling the elaine dance from seinfeld . thumbs in the air and all ! weird . director/choreographer pat birch should have fixed that . there are some good performances from some of the folks playing the t-birds and pink ladies . adrian zmed provides some chuckles with his false bravado in many scenes . chris mcdonald who plays the goose has been a solid performer in movies and tv for years . and you 're telling me lorna luft is a daughter of judy garland ? who new ? its good to see some of the faculty members are back from the original , but didi conn does n't seem to belong . it seems like the producers agreed and just kind of wrote her out of the movie by the third act . it 's really kind of odd how this movie has been aired seemingly more than the popular original over the years . it did n't hurt pfeiffer 's career -lrb- nor did marrying producer david e. kelly -rrb- , but this movie destroyed caulfield 's before it even began . he has kept somewhat busy , and was even considered at one point for the james bond role . but he 's never been the star he perhaps could have been . grease 2 is n't all bad . it 's worth about 5 of 10 stars . the hound .		5		0
the new russell crowe ` robin hood ' is actually a prequel . it tells the story of how the mythical outlaw became the great ` man of the people ' before roaming around sherwood forest with his ` merry men ' . instead of being pitted against the sheriff of nottingham -lrb- who has a minor part here -rrb- , robin takes on godfrey , a bald-headed bad guy and enforcer for king john who later betrays the homeland by allying himself with the french . ` robin hood ' begins nicely with a finely costumed and gritty battle scene in france . crowe plays robin longstride , an expert archer in king richard the lionheart 's army . the king has just returned from the third crusade in the holy land when he is felled by an arrow during battle . it would have been nice if the film 's scenarists had king richard only speaking french since he never spoke english and spent most of his adult life in europe , far from his native england . longstride decides to return to england after he assumes the identity of a dying knight , robin loxley , who has just been ambushed by godfrey and his men . promises loxley that he 'll return the family sword to his father back in nottingham . longstride returns richard 's crown to john and informs him of his death . john is promptly crowned the new king and is determined to tax the hell out of the kingdom . in his view , richard squandered the treasury by paying for all of intrigues on the continent and his ill-considered campaign in the holy land . he reminds his mother during a bitter argument that at one point , england had to pay a ransom to save richard after he had been kidnapped by the duke of austria in . with longstride 's appearance at the court , i found it perplexing that none of the noblemen recognized that he was an imposter . after longstride returns to nottingham and accepts sir walter loxley 's proposal to impersonate his now deceased son , even more improbable is that no one in the town seems to be able to connect the dots and figure out that longstride is not who he says he is . the main problem with ` robin hood ' is that russell crowe exudes little charm , playing the mischievous outlaw as a grim-faced action hero . as for his cohorts , little john and will scarlett , they have little to do except get drunk and assist robin and friar tuck as they steal grain , confiscated from the local population by church authorities . this act wins marion loxley over to robin after she initially is stunned when her father-in-law asks her to pretend that she 's married to longstride . most of the forest scenes can be found in the director 's cut which were wisely trimmed for the theatrical release . for those insist on watching the director 's cut , you 'll be treated to 1 -rrb- marion and a goat stuck in quicksand and both subsequently saved by robin and 2 -rrb- marion saving robin after he 's kidnapped by local orphans dressed as savages . ` robin hood ' fares no better with its antagonists . the screenwriters come up with nothing to distinguish godfrey from any of the typical bad guys found in any of today 's films , whether they 're based on real or fictional characters . and the sheriff of nottingham is even less likable than godfrey with his constant lecherous advances towards the widow marion . only john is a little more nuanced as he vacillates in trying to appease the rebellious northern barons . finally , history takes a back seat to any kind of verisimilitude when the french invade england shortly after john 's ascension to the throne . in reality , king philip of france recaptured territory in france and john promptly invaded that country . it was actually eighteen years later that france finally waged war in english territory . in addition , the signing of the magna carta and its disavowal by king john , also came years after as depicted here in this film . despite the convoluted chronologies , there is nothing wrong in attempting to depict robin hood in the context of his times . except for blatantly anachronistic scenes such as when the french disembark from their warships in the style of a d-day invasion , i found the attention to period detail to be impressive . nonetheless , without any charm emanating from the principal character , a lack of chemistry between the romantic leads , antagonists who show little complexity and glacial pacing in spots , the new ` robin hood ' is at best , a lackluster affair .		5		0
when it comes to movies about exorcism and possession , it 's hard to not compare that movie to `` the exorcist '' . i 'll do my best , but i 'm not making any promises , especially when this movie is about a young priest who shadows an old priest . there were very little scares and even less surprises , but the film is n't all bad -lrb- thanks to hopkins -rrb- , so if you 're looking for a scary good time , this film is n't for you . michael kovak -lrb- o'donoghue -rrb- is a who has lost his way and quite possibly , his faith . he emails father matthew -lrb- jones -rrb- to inform him that he would like to quit but father matthew ... suggests that michael take an exorcism course in italy in order to fulfill his tuition . michael flies over there and that 's where he meets father lucas trevant -lrb- hopkins -rrb- and angeline -lrb- braga -rrb- , a reporter trying to find out the truth about exorcism . father trevant introduces michael to a pregnant 16-year-old girl -lrb- gastini -- she 'll be playing mina harker in the new `` dracula 3d '' movie due out in 2012 -rrb- who may or may not be possessed . here 's where the movie starts to fall apart , in my opinion and mind you ... we 're about 40 minutes in . i could see the direction it was heading almost instantly . the clues are n't that subtle , it 's almost as if the screenwriter did n't want an air of mystery going into the final reels of the film . now i have n't read the book -lrb- supposedly , this movie was based on true-life events -- i 'll take that with a grain of salt , thank you very much -rrb- and i 'm not sure how the book handled it , but give us some mystery , please . at least with comedies that are predictable there might still be a laugh or two because of jokes and/or clever dialog . this film being a horror film , it does n't get those luxuries -- so why they chose to present it this way is beyond me . here 's some good things about the movie that you can look forward to : cinematography , acting , visual effects and makeup . the good news about this film is it 's not one of those shaky-cam fake documentaries with interviews and recordings of `` actual possessions '' . no , this is truly a big budget hollywood production and they spared no expense in making it look visually stunning . the dream sequences alone are one of the film 's redeeming qualities . sir anthony hopkins . there 's a reason why this man has an oscar . he just enters a role and completely lets it take over him . we have n't seen much of him lately -lrb- besides that `` thor '' movie -- never heard of it , what 's that movie about again ? -rrb- , his last starring role was in `` the wolfman '' . glad to see him here because without his presence , this movie would have surely suffered . not to say any of the other actors did a bad job , but they were your basic `` shock and awe '' performances that we 've all seen a hundred times over , so it was nice to have a seasoned veteran knocking about on screen -- it 's just too bad he was n't put in something just a little bit better . see more reviews at www.soveryterry.com final grade : c		5		0
`` the in-laws '' is a busy comedy which does a lot of things and does none of them well . built around a wedding which brings characters together so we can watch them clash , this film ventures into international spy stuff , personal and family issues , action , comedy , and even tries for some poignancy fizzling every average step of the way . i think this is what they call a `` popcorn '' flick because if you take it with popcorn at least you 'll have the popcorn to enjoy . best saved for broadcast . -lrb- c -rrb-		5		0
people can say anything they want about the action movies made in the eighties . but essentially they were more fun than most of the action movies made nowadays . so paying `` homage '' should depict this fun factor also . and i must admit that tracy morgan was very funny in this movie . but apart from the music and the simple plot there was nothing in this movie that can be seen as a tribute to those eighties movies . in my opinion this movie could have used more dramatic scenes to even out the comedic elements . even when most of the eighties action movies had absurd plots and action , it was always mixed with serious dramatic scenes to deepen our sympathy for the main characters . only tracy morgan succeeds in this with the whole wife is cheating on me plot line . bruce willis is quite the opposite of what he played in die hard . he was much to laid back for my taste . i was hoping for so much more especially with kevin smith directing this . for a good example of a good parody on the typical buddy cop movie watch `` the hard way '' with james woods and michael j.fox .		5		0
when anyone begins to talk about a contemporary special effects film , he needs to start out with the fact that if you throw enough money at something , it will look impressive . what makes it a good movie is plausibility . are the characters possible ? is the situation possible ? are there things that just do n't work . the stuff that happened in `` independence day '' is happening again . it 's not aliens ; it 's us . we have opened the pandora 's box and let out all the evils with our radiation , our ozone layers , our whatever . so all of a sudden , the world is pretty much ending . there are so many remarkable things that come to pass , but the main one is that there are people who seem to understand everything that happens ; they are experts on uncertainty . give me a break . if things were as bad as this , the shock wave would be way too much to handle in such a short time . the only people who would survive would do so because of being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time . i was astonished by people running down streets being chased by a wave of cold . holed up in the big public library , burning books and furniture to keep the temperature up . it 's just too much . the rescues are too unbelievable because they call for too much knowledge to pull off . it was a visually exciting film . if you are willing to suspend a ton of disbelief , you could get caught up in it . i never did .		5		0
michael mann loses his crime niche and clumsily stumbles and botches his way through a generic action thriller . i think it is clear what he is trying to do here with the gritty and realistic approach , but to quote depeche mode , `` it 's no good . '' miami vice proves a rigorous exercise in style over substance that will date badly because it is so contemporary . there is a scene that illustrates what i mean : the nightclub opening scene that regrettably becomes a pastiche of a sweaty nelly music video with a pumping beat and scantily-clad tanned women . indeed very little stays true to the original series , for which michael mann was a producer . the plot outline seems to remain most faithful as crockett and tubbs are forced to go undercover for the fbi to expose a botched miami and become increasingly entangled in the corrupt underworld where the lines between cop and villain are dangerously blurred . the story attempts a fairly performance-driven approach , as is arguably mann 's strength , but owing to the uninteresting characters and flat actors it suffers immensely . after all , it is difficult to take colin farrell and jamie foxx seriously when that comes out of their mouths is shameless and the former gets involved with ` -lrb- gong li -rrb- . but let us talk about the style of miami vice . stripping the tv series of everything that made it fun in the first place -- high hair , hammy technology , score , tequila sunrises and showy pink suits -- to pave way for sleek high-tech gadgets á la 21st century renders the film a grayish run-of-the-mill action thriller , collateral style . mann wields inexplicably grainy and unfocused cinematography , aiming for a look that is a muddy gray haze of digital pixels all in the name of documentary-style . the prevalence of stylistic and over-the-top gritty brutality undoubtedly offers some entertainment along the way but in the end the novelty wears off . yet there are many things that remain solid in the film and one can hardly complain about the explosions , fast-paced chases , hot cars and boats -lrb- in particular there is a vivid boat scene with farrell and li gliding on the ways with moby playing in the background -rrb- , exotic islands and women and fun sex scenes . miami vice offers plenty of moments to soak up the hot miami atmosphere -- although not nearly as effectively as the tv series did -- even a few moments too many when the film endlessly stretches across a whopping 2h . yes , a little editing would have been nice but given circumstances in which mann threw the stuff together in the end , it 's not bad . i was never a member of the michael mann camp and i even thought collateral was a below average film . for me miami vice cements the of his career , especially when the former dynamics of his cat-and-mouse games are gone and now feel more like dutiful inclusions than anything else . ` miami vice ' is not an unwatchable film at all but it is utterly charmless and feels sloppy at times . it also proves a polarizing force -- indeed it would appear as though many detractors are mere bandwagon riders while supporters give it high grades `` because it 's michael mann '' -lrb- seriously , i 've read professional magazine reviews citing that -rrb- . so let 's just agree that this is a distinctly mediocre film . 5 out of 10		5		0
i 've never seen any musketeer movies , not even the kiefer sutherland one , but i can tell this one ai n't the best . it 's very rushed and the script is as flat as a blown-out tire . i mean it 's written by the guy who created the police academy franchise . surely he should be blacklisted in hollywood by now . peter hyams once again becomes his own cinematographer and does a kinda okay job . none of his trademark flair or wonderful use of widescreen is in this film and nothing really comes across as pretty or atmospheric . and this whole deal with the film apparently having an eastern influence is total nonsense . there is like 2 fight scenes and neither of them are that spectacular and come across as a bit contrived . just because an asian guy did the choreography it does n't mean that this film has to look like the matrix . the actors do what they can with the poor story and limp dialogue but still come across as being bored , especially rea . tim roth looks and acts like a cross between chuck norris and charles dance and his character is a bit of a cliché . ` the man in black ' ... puh-lease . and if you 're kinda wondering who that is playing mena suvari 's evil uncle then you might recognise him as arthur fowler from long over-running bbc1 misery and despair soap eastenders . the musketeer also seems to be badly edited around the pg-rating . obviously this is what the studio wanted to aim for but it just seem right given the tone of the film and any scene in which someone dies looks like a badly staged pantomime . even and the three was more grown-up than this . and boy are those opening credits ugly ! see it only for free on a day you 've got nothing better to do .		5		0
it is 1933 and chicago is still suffering through the tail end of the great depression , money is scarce and times are tough for all . -lrb- johnny depp is -rrb- john dillinger : young , charismatic , good looking , egotistical and extremely self confident . dillinger gets what he wants , women , fine clothing and accessories . he funds all of these things by robbing banks and remaining 5 steps ahead of the inept police force at all times , often by crossing state lines where the local police are powerless . dillinger revels in the notoriety that comes with being a renowned criminal , and is savvy enough to realise limiting their actions to robbing banks -- and not taking hostages or killing innocents -- is the key to maintaining public sentiment . -lrb- christian bale is -rrb- melvin purvis : the new leader of a taskforce picked to hunt down the most dangerous of criminals . purvis is confident , analytical and incredibly determined . purvis has a solid track record of tracking high profile criminals and either bring them in or bringing them down . unfortunately the rest of the police force are n't similarly well-equipped to handle such important police work , which is part of the reason dillinger and gang remain free men . public enemies follows the activities of these two men over a period of time , mostly dillinger it needs to be said , as they cross paths and attempt to outdo one another in a high stakes game of cat and mouse . dillinger 's weakness for the finer things in life provides purvis and his squad with a vulnerable point when dillinger decides a young katy perry lookalike is to be his new woman , which he announces to her by informing her `` you 're my lady '' ... and i 'm only just paraphrasing . dillinger 's determined loyalty to this young woman means that he is constantly coming back to be with her , something the cops learn early in the piece and anticipate . when the mob become more than a little upset that dillinger 's activities are drawing the ire of too many law enforcement agencies from all over the country they put the heat on dillinger and tell him to lie low , and that previous safe houses are no longer available to him or his men . now more out in the open than ever before the smart thing to do would be to move away or give the game away -- but that was n't the dillinger way ... while it must have been fun to fang around in those old big black with guys holding tommy guns standing on the skirting boards and hanging on for dear life it just is n't that gripping as an audience member . similarly running around shooting thousands of blanks at other actors while wearing cool hats and long trenchcoats might have been a blast for the actors , it just does n't relay especially well on screen . this is exactly the same problem that faced ridley scott 's robin hood ; when you tell the same story again and again it just gets a little stale . at worst that results in robin hood , but unless you change the mix up or add something new to proceedings the best result is what we see here , a solid period drama that is better than you think it might be -- but exactly what you thought it would be . no-one stands around gawking at the miracle of compact discs anymore . although it was a design breakthrough at the time technology and time has moved on . there are newer , cooler and flat out better things out there . with public enemies michael mann showed us a cd and expected people to react like it was the japanese launch of the ipad . final rating -- 5.5 / 10 . at one point dillinger gets bored and on a whim walks into the police station and into the very department assigned to hunt him down . if that is supposed to be `` based on a true story '' then so is avatar . aside from that public enemies is solid , well acted , too long -- and bland .		5		0
woody allen after his 1970s heyday reminds me of something the manager of spinal tap said : `` they are n't losing popularity . their appeal is just more selective . '' even armed with a good idea and a luminous lead performance by his , mia farrow , allen 's 1985 film `` the purple rose of cairo '' is a comic fantasy that is neither especially funny nor that trippy . instead , it presents another of his bergmanesque ruminations on the misery and finality of life , appealing to his audience and distancing everyone else . farrow stars as cecilia , already with three strikes against her . it 's the depression , she 's married to an abusive lout , and she lives in new jersey . her only refuge is the local jewel movie house , where she escapes into the `` madcap manhattan weekend '' that is `` the purple rose of cairo '' . while watching the film for a fifth straight time , cecelia is surprised when one of the characters , tom baxter -lrb- jeff daniels -rrb- , jumps off the screen and declares his love for her . it 's a great concept , and its execution is the film 's best sequence , daffy and thrilling . mia winningly playing a nebbish by channeling her 's on screen personality -lrb- it 's woody by proxy in this movie , as the man himself stays offscreen -rrb- , accompanied by delightful music by dick hyman . cecelia and tom share observations of life in their respective worlds in a decrepit amusement park he makes into his hiding place . he tells her he has been watching her for days , peaking at her when professing his love to another on-screen character . she gives him popcorn , which he reacts to like ambrosia from heaven . `` been watching people eat it for all those performances , '' he says . `` when they rattle those bags , though , that 's annoying . '' the comedy never moves beyond that , except when we return to the jewel to see the other film actors venting over tom 's desertion . cecelia and tom 's relationship never evolves , either , as cecelia proves surprisingly unwilling to accept this dream come true . that 's what throws me most about `` the purple rose of cairo '' . when farrow 's eyes look up at you so puppy-like you feel her need for deliverance , yet everything about the film , including the character , is too hardhearted to led the fantasy breathe for a moment . daniels does n't have a lot to do as tom , except sit in the old amusement park and innocently chat up some prostitutes . daniels does double duty as the real-life actor who portrayed tom , gil shepherd , and is not as effective , so clipped and smug in his delivery you know what 's going to happen with him from the moment he first appears . spoiler alert - i side with those people who call the ending too downbeat for the rest of the film . it 's even more downbeat when one considers cecelia 's inexplicable culpability in the conclusion of the tom story . some see her last moments on screen as woody 's testimony to the wonder of cinema ; i see an addict taking her final , fatal hit - spoiler alert ends . the film has integrity and offers some moments , magic and otherwise , along the way . but for a movie about cinema 's spell on people , it proves a strangely inert experience .		5		0
if there 's a quick and easy way to make a movie out of stieg larsson 's `` the girl who played with fire , '' the second of the `` millennium trilogy '' books , screenwriter jonas frykberg and director daniel alfredson have found it . rather than wrap their minds around larsson 's tome , they trim the fat and deliver the bare bones . fortunately for us , noomi rapace still stands front and center . rapace 's lisbeth salander becomes the main suspect in a murder investigation several months after the events of `` the girl with the dragon tattoo . '' the murder of a journalist and his wife working on an expose of sex trafficking for millennium takes sweden by storm , but you 'd never know it in this adaptation . the scope of the investigation is significantly diminished . the way the papers and various investigators on the case and distort salander 's image as a psychotic possible prostitute gets lost , which would not be a problem if it did n't damage the larsson 's superb themes and the ultimate portrait of salander that 's so vital to his novels . there 's no denying the advantages to trucking along in a story with an insane amount of components and frankly , reworking these 700 or so pages into a two-hour framework is something i would n't wish on any screenwriter . to frykberg 's credit , he figures out exactly the minimum of what needs to go in to make the story work logistically . as for alfredson , he hopes that attention to detail -lrb- making sure salander uses a powerbook and that the blond giant drives a volvo -rrb- will appease the fans who feel maimed by the large structural gaps of the script . the lone pole that keeps this tent pitched is still rapace . in retrospect , it 's hard to believe she has so few lines in the film because her inner monologue runs constantly . she perfectly captures the introverted qualities of the character , even if she seems a bit soft at times when her inner badass could be a bit more ferocious . unfortunately , co-star michael as journalist mikael blomqvist ends up one of the casualties of the script 's skeletal nature . he gets a few strong scenes , such as his interrogation of gunnar , a key source relating to the murders , but the essence of his characters has been reduced to crusader for salander 's innocence , leaving him largely one - dimensional . the film never revisits or reminds us about the deep yet ailing relationship between him and salander forged in `` dragon tattoo '' that plays a subconscious role in the outcome of this story . fans of the book will find this effort faithful but hollow , a by-the-numbers adaptation that works as a mystery and acts as good enough wish fulfillment , which is always the primary reason why we feel inclined to watch movies based on books we 've read . although the creative hands adapting the series have seemed to change for the worse , at least rapace remains and as strong as ever . ~ steven c visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com		5		0
ghosts of girlfriends past i am not a huge romantic comedy fan ... but i do n't mind matthew films . he is actually quite funny . this was a disappointment though . it was alright mostly , but it was nothing great . i was hoping for more comedy but there was n't really a lot to laugh about . the situations that matthew gets in could have been funny , but instead were just cringe worthy . he plays a completely unlikeable character . the story is a complete rip off of a christmas carol . a guy is a womaniser and he get 's visited by 3 ghosts to show him in the past , present and future etc ... it is a classic story , but i think they killed it with this . they should stop making this now . the story has been made so many times and there are some great versions and some terrible ones . enough is enough . i think hollywood needs to think of some more original ideas . no more rehashes or remakes . 9 times out of 10 they are not better than the original , so why bother ? the casting was alright ... the films stars matthew mcconaughey , jennifer garner and michael douglas . they all do reasonable jobs and were convincing in their roles . i just think matthew needs to change the direction of his acting . i know he has started taking more serious roles now , which is a good thing . he was amazing in a time to kill . i still think that was his best film -lrb- that i have seen -rrb- . jennifer is a good actress , but has not really made anything that sticks out in my mind to make her a great actress ... hopefully one day she will get that role that catapults her . michael douglas is a legend ... he has made some fantastic movies in the past and i hope that he makes a lot more in the future . ghosts of girlfriends past ran along at a good pace ... i was not really bored throughout the movie . it kept me entertained , but i think it should have been so much more . matthew seems to have made 1 too many romantic comedies . i will give this film 5 out of 10 . `` so here 's a couple of tips . when you first meet a girl you give her two compliments above the neck . yeah , tell her she 's got nice lips , nice eyes , nice hair ... she 's intelligent , her moral ethics , whatever crap comes to your mind . then just when she begins to thinks that you 're another - you know - vanilla nice guy that she can tool around with all night without getting naked ... you insult her ! flip the power dynamic and your let her know that you 're here to play .

this production -lrb- courtesy of italian media tycoon and future prime minister , silvio berlusconi ! -rrb- is yet another vicious gangland melodrama from abel ferrara : this is actually a slight step up from fear city -lrb- 1984 ; see above -rrb- but , for all the film 's patent slickness , it is gradually done in by annoying characters , mannered performances and ponderous direction . christopher walken has a -lrb- self-indulgent -rrb- field day as frank white , a who , when he is not hanging out with his black cohorts and partying up a storm with his molls , is killing off his adversaries in nasty or rubbing shoulders with elite society at gala dinners . nothing exactly new then but , to the usual ingredients , ferrara adds a deafening soundtrack , sleaze , vigilante police officers , sleaze , asian and more sleaze . having said that , the occasional effectively handled sequence -lrb- david caruso 's brutal killing during a fellow police officer 's funeral service , the train confrontation between white and his ageing cop nemesis , white 's own slightly ambiguous come-uppance , etc. -rrb- - shines through regardless . for what it 's worth , the film features three early appearances by future character : laurence fishburne -lrb- playing frank white 's right-hand man , an especially irritating characterization as a swaggering thug with a maniacal laugh who just begs to be shot but who , unfortunately for this viewer , does not get his just desserts until fairly late in the game ! -rrb- , wesley snipes -lrb- as one of the afore-mentioned vigilante cops -rrb- and a blink-and-you 'll - steve buscemi as a dope `` tester '' .		5		0
i ca n't put my finger on how many war movies have been made . what i do know for certain is that this is one to many . to begin with , the film is extremely boring . this mainly because the incredible amounts of information given , but without enough drive and move forward to release the information into valid information . speaking from a dramatic viewpoint , the amount of information that are n't released , but merely ends up more like debris , just cluttering the moral of the story . thus the final message of the movie just hangs there , without being able to give anything of substance .		5		0
i have been a horror movie fan for a long time , i have went against the opinions of the majority on many occasions and was more than willing to do the same for boogeyman , unfortunately i just ca n't . the movie was not good , in fact i would fight to not sit through it again . i think a lot of that has to fall on the director stephen kay . boogeyman is the story of a young man , tim , who as a child his father disappeared . what everyone does n't believe is that his father was taken right before tim 's eyes by the boogeyman himself . now years later tim is struggling with that memory . when his mother passes away he is forced to return to the home where his father was taken . the evil that existed there before is still there and is determined to push tim over the edge . the cast of boogeyman is adequate enough , barry watson in the lead role does n't a decent job with what he is given to perform which seems to be nothing more than a look of complete and utter devastation every time he opens a door . the majority of this film seems to rely on him opening closet after closet , after closet and expecting us to be on the edge of our seat every time . but the unfortunate part is nothing ever seems to happen and when it does happen you barely know it 's happening . the death scenes and most of the actions scenes are done like a choppy music video and you have no idea what 's going on and eventually you do n't care . the story line is sporadic and confusing and you wonder if you 're going crazy by the end of it . the ending made no sense and by the time you got to that point you do n't know what 's going on . they try to set a sense of terror for something that you never actually see . there is no bad guy , it 's all in the faces of it 's victims which could have been cleverly used but instead was an annoyance . the film was just poorly put together and could have been a great series for the horror genre but it was ruined and i think after seeing it , i blame the director but nonetheless it 's not good period !! 5/10		5		0
i like this film very much , although i 'm not sure it 's a classic by any means . in fact , i think there should probably be a new genre of studio drama called the cusack to replace the rather amorphous ` quirky ' ... ... the point is that this -lrb- to invoke other genres -rrb- drama has a super core roster of characters . cusack himself is an all-american superstar in his little world ; i.e. resting on his laurels . billy maverick genius outsider russell provides the challenges that nick finally rises to through a circuitous route of desperate housewife cate blanchett and needy nihilist angelina jolie . for all the entertaining conceits involving these four my favourite bits are the well-orchestrated ensemble set pieces in the control tower . 5/10		5		0
they take so many of steven kings many best sellers and turn them into movies . for the most part they miss the mark by a longshot with only around three exceptions maybe 5 depending on who you ask these include the shining , stand by me , and the shawshank redemtion . most of his books tuned into movies are terrible and this is one of those . the acting is alright but its nothing like the book at all . the book was very disturbing while this is not in the least disturbing . the story line is not even kept the same . it was the biggest disappointment since `` it '' you should only really watch this if you have not read the book but then again id just say read the book . this movie is about a young boy who finds out one of the elderly men in his neighbourhood is actually a nazi war criminal . he ends up blackmailing him into telling him the horrors of the nazi death camps because the kid has a sick obsession with it . he thinks he has all the control over the old man but the old has his tricks . like i said this movie is no where near as good as the book . if you want a really intense disturbing book read it stay away from the movie unless there is no chance you will ever read the book .		5		0
this film does continue the collection of films with chucky the killer possessed doll , but it kind of focuses on hollywood a bit at the same time . basically we see a young doll named shitface , soon renamed as glen/glenda -lrb- he is voiced by the lord of the rings ' pippin , billy boyd -rrb- who has dreams that he is like his parents , chucky -lrb- brad dourif -rrb- and tiffany -lrb- jennifer tilly -rrb- . soon enough , when he brings them back to life in two lookalike movie dolls , they have to promise not to kill anymore to give a good example to glen/glenda . they both do n't keep it up , they are addicted . they plan to impregnate movie star jennifer tilly , again ? they want the babies to be their new human bodies . also starring redman , hannah spearritt as joan and john waters as pete peters . filled with pretty good gore and lots of tilly flashing her wonderful cleavage . worth watching !		5		0
the wolverine is one of the better made super-hero flicks of its era . screenwriters mark bomback and scott frank have come up with a story that 's better than spider-man 1 or 3 , iron man 2 or 3 , either hulk movie and both captain america and thor combined . director james mangold also does fine work , though many of the action scenes suffer from the modern blight of camera movement that 's so frenetic you can barely tell who is hitting whom . the special effects are solid and even the soundtrack is well done . and the cast , highlighted by the tremendous hugh jackman , is as appealing as you 'll find . there 's almost every ingredient here you need to make a great motion picture . the one thing missing , however , is so important that it negates almost everything positive . wolverine is not a great character . yes , i know . he 's the most popular comic book creation of the last 40 years and has joined , if not surpassed , batman , superman and spider-man in the hearts of super-hero fans . that 's still does n't change the fact that he 's not a great character . or to be more accurate , that 's he 's only a great character in the limited role for which he was originally conceived . wolverine was created to be a one-off opponent for the hulk and then was hauled out of mothballs to join a revamped x-men roster and as a rebel anti-hero in opposition to or operating alongside more traditional heroic types , logan is a whole lot of fun . on his own as the emotional and narrative heart of a story , he 's a whole lot of one-note nothing . wolverine is nothing more than adolescent badassery given form . he has none of the natural depth of peter parker or bruce wayne . those characters are enmeshed with bigger concepts like responsibility , guilt , compulsion and myriad other things . wolverine is about nothing more than looking , talking and acting `` cool '' and every attempt to graft more onto him ultimately fails . this film ambitiously tries to build off both logan 's sense of loss from killing jean grey in x-men : the last stand and his weariness over decades of existence to give him some pathos , then strips him of his healing factor to try and make him slightly vulnerable . but adolescent badassery and vulnerability never mix and by the end of the movie , logan is back to getting skewered through the chest by a katana and shrugging it off like it was a splinter . the super power that originally meant he could recover from a non-fatal gunshot in a day has into every boy 's fantasy of never being hurt by anything . and if you think i 'm wrong , ask yourself this . what are the best wolverine moments on the big screen . they 're all from the first two , are n't they ? moments when he may have been the star but shared the screen and story with others . or why did they need to go back to a 4 issue limited series from 30 years ago for the guts of this motion picture ? no one wrote a wolvie story-arc in the last 20 years that was good enough for the job ? in many respects , this movie helps to solidify the standard of quality by which the whole genre should be judged . it really is that good in so many ways . but just because a comic book character is popular , that does n't mean he or she can carry an entire film .		5		0
mr blandings -lrb- cary grant -rrb- decides to relocate because his new york apartment is so crowded . he buys a heap of shite in the middle of nowhere and then decides to knock it down and build his own house . well , that 's what he does - he builds his own house and we follow his trials until the house is built . it 's not a very exciting story and i kept drifting off to sleep on a second viewing . cary grant is always easy to watch and he delivers his usual double takes and trademark looks of bewilderment and amazement . and that 's where the comedy comes from in this rather uninteresting story . the children are irritating and there are tedious slapstick routines . myrna loy as his wife `` muriel '' is sometimes annoying because there are several scenes in which she just stares at her husband as if to say `` is n't he funny ? what 's he going to do now ? '' there actually is a funny scene when mr blandings returns home the morning after a storm to find bill cole -lrb- melvyn douglas -rrb- parading around in a with his wife muriel and he casually greets mr blandings as if nothing is out of the ordinary . it 's one of the rare moments that sticks in the memory . and who on earth would sit down to eat a plate of something called `` wham '' ? according to this film , an incredibly stupid american public would . the film is essentially a non-offensive waste of time . my girlfriend liked it more than me - giving it 6/10 so maybe you have to love cary grant to make it a worthwhile pursuit of time .		5		0
the above summary actually sounds better , as an idea in and of itself , than the resulting movie . after kurt wimmer 's surprisingly entertaining and under looked equilibrium -lrb- starring pre-batman christan bale -rrb- , i had high expectations for his third movie . i had seen this movie in it 's theatrical debut . i remember leaving the theater , however , confused and bewildered . i figured the second time around would yield a better indicator of the actual worth of the movie . kurt wimmer made a movie based on a non-existing comic book . the convoluted story is about a authoritarian dystopia , where a super soldier virus evolves into a plague and leads to forced and ultimately genocide . two factions are born ; the healthy -lrb- totalitarian state -rrb- and the infected -lrb- terrorist rebel underground - a.k.a. hemophages , a.k.a. `` '' , a.k.a. vampires -rrb- . symptoms of the infection include stronger bones , better hearing and eyesight , faster healing and hyper-fast reflexes . the only drawback is the dozen year life span . in all honesty , i like the first half of this movie . the first 5 minutes is an action movie delight , complete with an air ball ninja death squad . the narrative voice-over , that follows , is when the dread begins . this is mostly due to the realization that this is a puree of preexisting ideas . equilibrium -lrb- also a puree -rrb- worked because it did n't try too hard . it did n't fall into the computer graphics trap . it presented a world that was slightly askew , yet eerily possible . all those things that worked in equilibrium have been tweaked here to the nth degree and subsequently combines into a frankenstein movie . unfortunately , it just looks , feels and acts too much like an aeon flux clone . do we really need two ? the movie is a hell of a nonsensical but visually stimulating ride , until about 1/2 way through . this is about the time when our infected and heroine , violet -lrb- milla jovovich -rrb- , ends up on the fence between her people and the organization she is sworn to defend because her maternal instincts kick in . a highly skilled assassin turns into a highly skilled mom . milla jovovich has a certain knack for picking outrages roles and generally excels in things requiring little acting ability . she does look exceptional in a tight body suit . some of the technology has a nice wow-factor -lrb- gravity leveler and space , to name a couple -rrb- , but is simply there for show . the second half of the movie is her trying to act in the middle of a nonsensical , non-stop action scenario . it becomes a case of `` are we done yet ? '' . it is just too much and too repetitious to deal with . nothing new is added to the mix after this point , so it becomes a case of rinse & repeat . as in his previous movie , colors are primary and important . i guess wimmer forgot to add the visual context , because all the color changes just seem to be part of the cool factor and have little to do with the plot . there is a lot of wire work and continuation of gun-kata -lrb- from equilibrium -rrb- . the problem is we are made to believe that a nurse and wife became an uber , assassin through a change and not training . is wimmer choosing nature over nurture or is he just so intoxicated off the smell of his own genius that he did n't even consider what he was creating ? for wimmer this is his modern prometheus . it is the monster he created with his own hands , that is currently proving to be his outdoing . on my `` shot scale '' this is a 5 drink minimum . the top half is good , with the bottom half being synonymous to diving head-first into an empty swimming pool . save the last 3 shots for the second half of the movie , as you will be bored to tears otherwise . here 's a toast to wimmer . may his next movie not suck ! zum wohl ! - celluloid rehab		5		0
this remake of the stepford wives , a movie i liked a lot , is hit or miss . i do n't know who this movie hates more : the women or the men . the men are mostly male chauvinists who want their wives to wait on them hand and foot . the women come across as shrill and unhappy . bette midler and nicole kidman are good in their roles , but their characters are simply not interesting or likable . i have never been a bette midler because i think she comes across as simply loud and that 's what happens in this movie . kidman 's character makes mean spirited reality tv shows -lrb- the footage from which is funnier than most of the rest of the film because it actually satirizes reality tv which i hate -rrb- before moving to stepford . are either of these characters worth rooting for ? i do n't think so . matthew broderick actually comes across best as kidman 's loving husband . glenn close and christopher are also very good . faith hill has some good moments of physical comedy . however , john lovitz -lrb- ! -rrb- is badly miscast as midler 's -lrb- !! -rrb- husband . there are some laughs but you know exactly whee this movie is going before it goes there . 5/10 and i think that is generous .		5		0
while it contains some inventive visual flourishes and a brooding atmosphere bathed in shadow , `` the stranger '' comes off as a rather dry exercise in film noir aesthetics . orson welles plays a nazi war criminal living in america , teaching at a prestigious college , and arranged to marry loretta young , daughter of a prominent politician . in a great performance , edward g. robinson is the dc detective out to rein in welles and his ilk . while the subject matter is rather daring for its time -lrb- the film was released in 1946 -rrb- , it is dated by today 's standards , and the machinations of the plot putter along rigidly . save for some striking imagery , it 's difficult to get worked up over `` the stranger '' 's final outcome .		5		0
nothing has been spared , production wise , with the v i p 's . they sure do n't make them like this anymore . while the story is a bit of a soap opera , some of the acting is quite good for a film of this ilk . elizabeth and richard burton are so-so , as is orson welles and louis . less of them would have made a better film . the airport in london is fogged in and the story focuses on a few of the v i p 's . love triangles prevail as well as money issues for most of the people . it 's kind of a ala grand hotel of sorts . the best thing about the movie is maggie smith -lrb- a jewel of a performance -rrb- and the lush music . how nice to hear a theme which is no longer used in todays films . the dvd transfer is super and while i would n't want to own the film , it 's a great rental .		5		0
i 'm not a huge fan of comedies , i 'm even less of a fan of dirty raunchy comedies and not because i 'm offended easily , you could n't offend me if you tried ... they just are n't funny . as an adult i am not amused by fart jokes and yelling body parts to get a laugh . however , that being said ... i really looked forward to ted . i know it would be raunchy and dirty but i thought seth macfarlane might bring a certain level of intelligence to the silly comedy genre like he does with family guy . i was sorely disappointed . ted spends more than half of it 's run time being outrageous stupid adam humour that resorts to the most juvenile of sex jokes and drugs . half way through i thought i would be scoring this a 2 if it was lucky . however , surprisingly so the film does turn itself around slightly in the latter half . i really thought ted would have a good story to go with the raunchy comedy but the good story does n't really start until more than three quarters of the way through the movie . i also give the film kudos for the insane amount of 80 's media nods from music to film to television because that is a lot of fun for anyone who loved the 80 's . the cast is almost surprisingly good considering how bad most of the script is . mark wahlberg continues to prove his diversity as pot smoking , life struggling , and often lazy john . he has an undeniable chemistry on screen and the banter with ted is really amusing sometimes . mila kunis plays her role well although it 's a simple enough role . her and wahlberg have good chemistry and her character is a little basic but she does well . seth macfarlane is our ted . obviously the guy is a multi-talented comedian and can do many voices . i am a little confused why he chose ted 's voice to be one and the same with peter griffin though they do make fun of that at one point which was amusing . still you ca n't doubt macfarlane 's comedic talent as ted 's voice . he nails it . the supporting cast includes joel mchale -lrb- why does he always play a sleaze-bag in comedies ? -rrb- and a skeezy and perfectly villainous giovanni ribisi . the cast all work well together and probably pull the awful script out of being completely lost . i suppose i wanted ted to be nasty and dirty but also have some heart . and in the end it tries to do that but its way too late . it relies far too heavily on really juvenile jokes that do n't really work . it jumps from shocking jokes about racism to sex and i did laugh , i even hazard to say i laughed a lot but it meant nothing because the film leaves you feeling very empty . this film got really hyped up by so many people and i heard nothing but how amazing and hilarious it was so i 'm sure my expectations were probably high going into it but the film remains a sub par effort in the dirty comedy genre . 5/10		5		0
having not really been around for the first three , i figured that i 'd not let the new three films escape me at the cinema . i was determined to catch `` the phantom menace '' and did so -lrb- and it is so much better in a cinema , let me tell you -rrb- but i had to watch `` star wars : episode 2 - attack of the clones '' by myself as i could n't find anyone else willing to give the franchise a chance . sadly , i did n't feel the force was strong with this one but stumbling across it again on tv last night gave me the opportunity to re-evaluate it while my better half was snuggling into my chest . hey , there were in it and besides , she did n't mind ! the fifth film once again has ewan mcgregor as jedi knight obi-wan kenobi who has taken young anakin skywalker -lrb- hayden christensen -rrb- under his wing as his padawan apprentice . after an attempt on the life of senator amidala -lrb- natalie portman -rrb- , anakin is assigned to protect her while kenobi sets off to uncover who 's behind the plot . but during the investigation , kenobi discovers a secret clone army apparently ordered by the jedi while anakin embarks on a forbidden affair with the senator . criticisms that have been levelled at the new films is that there is far too much reliance on cgi scenes and characters and that is certainly true of episode 2 . at times , mcgregor is the only real thing you see on screen although things do improve for the obligatory trip to tunisia -lrb- i mean , tattooine -rrb- . but the magic you felt when you saw chewbacca for the first time is replaced with hatred when jar jar binks makes a -lrb- thankfully brief -rrb- reappearance . other things clash with what has gone before in the earlier films . anakin comes across as less a jedi and more a psychotic stroppy teenager while obi-wan feels like a slightly neurotic mess with more issues than greenpeace . not the fault of the actors but more as a result for some really duff dialogue which , if we 're honest , has never been george lucas ' strong point . there are only so many times you can hear someone say `` i 've got a bad feeling about this '' without wanting to slap the screenwriter . what lucas does do well is action-packed set pieces and here is where episode 2 steps up to the plate and delivers . aside from the typically climatic battle scenes at the end , the undoubted highlight is the battle between countless cgi baddies and hundreds of jedi knights . and even though you finally get to see yoda kick some ass , there is much to disappoint too . principal among these is christopher lee 's villainous count dooku , who is n't a patch on darth maul from episode 1 . personally , i also find george 's obsession with cramming the film with shots of earlier characters -lrb- including boba fett , uncle owen and c3-po -rrb- very annoying - this is supposed to be star wars , not days of our lives in space . and on that subject , the ill-fated romance between anakin and amidala feels so out of place , it 's unreal . it slows the whole thing down and juggles with the already complex plot so that the viewer feel disorientated and somewhat annoyed that there is so little ` star wars ' going on . so is the film any good ? as master yoda himself might say , a good film fancy visuals do not make . it looks the part and during the jaw-dropping jedi battle , you do feel that this is a worthy addition to the series . but only during that scene - the rest of the time , you 're shaking your head in disappointment . if ever a film series has become a victim of its own success then the three prequels are critically damaged . due to massive expectation -lrb- only slightly dampened after episode 1 -rrb- , this film was bound to disappoint but even on it 's own , this is not a patch on the earlier three films . it 's entertaining in a mindless way but because you will almost certainly have experience of a star wars movie , you 'll find yourself wishing the millennium falcon would drift into the picture , han and leia at the helm . although you already knew it , it 's best to stick with the first three films .		5		0
well , i 've seen worse , lots worse . in its favor , the movie still features one of the coolest -lrb- and best implemented -rrb- monster designs ever to emerge from the old b & w films of that era , and the underwater photography is still quite arresting - apparently the actor in the creature costume was capable of holding his breath underwater for incredible amounts of time , and so the creature looks entirely at home and natural in the water . against it ? a weak screen play where nothing interesting happens for almost 30 minutes in two different parts of the movie . some of the worst movie dialog actors have ever been forced to utter -lrb- i can just imagine how john `` i worked with john wayne once '' agar must have died inside while trying to deliver some of his . -rrb- a distinct lack of chemistry between agar and lori nelson and a screen play that does nothing to give them anything to draw them together -lrb- except for the old `` you are so `` the only person around '' problem -rrb- . worse , the creature himself seems over-exposed here . since the movie yanks him out of his creepy , isolated , backwater lagoon in the first 15 minutes , he loses the mystery and most of his menace from his original surroundings once he is moved to his bright , shiny sea world . after that , he 's just a good costume and a set of talons . the guy who wrote `` keep watching the skies '' remarked about `` revenge of the creature '' that the only good things about this sequel are the elements they kept from the first one . i 'd have to agree that this is about right - everything the film makers tried to add and expand on in the sequel just did n't really click . still , as a little kid , this would have been great fun .		5		0
i was expecting better from steve carroll and tina fey , but for me , this movie just did n't deliver . there was n't anything that made me laugh out loud . some scenes were amusing . carroll and fey play a married couple that take the reservation of another couple at a fancy restaurant . it turns out the the other couple stole a flash drive from some gangster and he 's hired two goons to get it back , and the goons happen to be cops . so , these cops take carroll and fey and threaten them . they escape and hunt down a friend played by mark wahlberg . wahlberg had the best scenes , as he stands there shirtless while everyone seems to make comments about it . the 2 track down the disk and want to return it . they are still being chased by the bad cops and the good cops and have to do a dance at the end . final verdict : not good enough to recommend .		5		0
director william malone , who in 1999 gave us house on haunted hill , strikes again with feardotcom . as with that earlier effort , malone has given us a film containing several frightening images , but a plot that is sorely lacking . most people will not be satisfied with the picture as a whole , but some of the scenes we see may pop up later in our nightmares . the film basically centers around a website where unlucky voyeurs can witness a man known as `` the doctor '' torture and murder victims . anyone who chooses to officially enter the site will die of their greatest fear exactly 48 hours later though ! gasp ! they wo n't actually die of what they fear . the fear itself kills them ... or something like that . the plot is a bit muddled , but all we know is this is a site you do n't want to visit . some people do , however , and our heroes stephen dorff and natascha mcelhone are out to find out what killed them . he 's a cop , and she 's some sort of public health official . at first they think some sort of virus is killing the victims since blood gushes from their eyes . it 's not long before both of them are trapped and forced to play by the rules of this website . all i can say regarding the plot is forget it ! there are too many loose ends and contrivances for anything to possibly add up . we are never even sure who 's in control of the website . is it the doctor , or a young woman he tortured to death years ago ? if the site is in fact a way for the young woman to seek revenge against voyeurs who want to watch sadism , then why does it star the man who killed her ??? there are other problems besides plot to focus on . the acting is not particularly outstanding . this may be due to some of the european actors struggling to sound like americans . also , i know this i a horror film , but many of the scenes in this film are badly under-lit . much of the dialog is sub-par , as well . the gore was trimmed drastically after this film was threatened with an nc-17 rating . only in the last half hour does the film seem to find the right note . the dialog is toned down , and malone gives us some dazzling visuals as our heroes enter the doctor 's lair to rescue a victim . the color is absolutely amazing in these late sequences . the verdict : 5 of 10 stars . the film is creepy to look at , but that 's about it . perhaps the best way to enjoy this film would be to turn the sound down and have it playing in the background of a halloween party . now there 's an idea ! the hound .		5		0
just what went wrong with this b-level horror flick ? a good question . barry watson of tv plays a young man who as a child saw his father murdered by something in the closet . now watson is trying to get on with his life , but the thing in the closet wo n't let him . maybe the film was too similar to the tooth fairy , which came out roughly at the same time . the monster in the closet is certainly a letdown , looking a lot like the mummy , of all things . also , it is defeated in the silliest of ways . watson is a nice looking guy but not much of an actor . that does n't help things . emily deschanel is the love interest , but she has little to do except to look skeptical and then scared . the ghost of a little girl who keeps appearing to watson is the film 's best element , but by herself she ca n't save the film .		5		0
' i am legend ' is ` the omega man ' updated . and it 's daft . the complete recreation of a deserted and dilapidated new york is very nicely realised . it 's on an even grander scale than ` after humans ' . i enjoyed seeing the grasses and weeds shoving through the roads and pavements and putting up two fingers at human arrogance . it 's just as john described london in ` the triffids ' . there 's been a plague . thanks to the efforts of a well-intentioned , but unfortunately-named dr krippen , a cure became the opposite . we are told that 90 % of humanity died , 9 % turned ` zombie flesh-eater ' and 1 % were immune . most of the latter got eaten by the zombies . it 's a hard life . will smith plays new york 's sole survivor . and he 's a doctor with special knowledge of disease and immunity - which is handy . he also seems to be an expert on electronics and explosives too . hmm . his wife and child got killed in a helicopter accident during , leaving him with his alsatian puppy which has since grown up . so here he is , working on his own , trying to find a cure , and gradually going screwy . like all of our ancient terrors ; the zombies only come out at night , so he 's more or less free to roam in the daytime . he for food , traps the odd zombie for experiments , hunts wild game and collects cd 's . the disease is apparently both an airborne and contact contagion . legend himself has complete immunity . his dog , meanwhile , only has immunity from the airborne form . how there can be any difference between the two when the disease symptoms themselves are identical is unclear , and merely serves to demonstrate a lack of research on the part of film-makers . like so many of them nowadays ; they assume audiences to be just uneducated clots who can be with special-effects . not only that ; if the disease can infect dogs , why has n't it infected the herds of wild game ? or the lions , for that matter . surely they must contain the vital element of immunity then -lrb- yet our hero concentrates upon rats and zombies -rrb- . moreover ; why have n't the zombies tracked all the animals down at night and eaten them ? furthermore ; the zombies are running a temperature , heart-rate etc on par with an athlete , and they 're wearing almost no clothes -lrb- they wear enough to satisfy the censors ! -rrb- . to be in such work-out condition for an hour would be strenuous enough , but to sustain it 24/7 would require a huge intake . 5,000 + per day . from where is this energy being drawn ? they 'd have to eat pure lard , or be burned-out within 48hrs . i do n't mean to nit-pick , but if a movie is going to have quasi pretensions like this one , it 's no good vacillating between plausibility and absurdity just to appease a plot that does n't stand to reason . either be a sci-fi movie or a horror fantasy ; do n't try to rationalise one into the other . that creates a fairy tale . which brings me to the culminating question . why is legend trying to develop a vaccine at all ? the few remaining normal people left alive like him already have natural immunity . the zombies are so violent that even if they ca n't infect you they 'll rip you to shreds , so you 'll likely get slaughtered trying to use it on any of them . the logical thing is to just clear out and let nature take its course . if you 're someone who does n't stop to think : if you just sit there and take the whole thing as it unfolds without evaluation or question - in other words , answer to the prescription of its makers - then there is some decent tension , excellent set-pieces and lots of second-rate cgi to enjoy , and will smith gives a very decent turn for his paycheque . but that 's it . it 's not a thinking person 's experience . the ending is perhaps daftest of all . partway through the movie , during a crisis , he is rescued by a pretty heroine who turns up with a young boy . both have immunity too . so , at last he no longer has to talk to himself or tailors ' dummies . and he 's no longer alone -lrb- by now the dog 's dead -rrb- . this girl insists that there 's an upstate enclave of survivors . which is something legend dismisses as complete twaddle . yet in the last moments , when he has finally isolated a vaccine and the 's have invaded his stronghold , he gives the vaccine to her and the boy and ushers them into an escape tunnel . so where does he imagine they are going , if he does n't believe the enclave exists ? and what does he suppose she will do with his vaccine ? meanwhile , instead of going with her , he shuts off the ` escape route ' and blows himself up with the zombies . he could just as easily have pulled the pin , chucked the grenade , and escaped with the girl as well . daft . if you think this movie is in any way exceptional , then you should check-out jodie foster 's ` flightplan ' .		5		0
the movie had potential , but clearly it did n't come together . while i liked the concept and i liked albert brooks and michael douglas , this movie had far too many pratfalls in direction and writing to be called a winner . if the jokes had managed to create some laughs , this would have been a rather entertaining movie . instead , it will have to be listed in the ` mildly entertaining category . ' it 's hard to put down the performances , because i felt they were all pretty good , but it just felt like the writers did n't try hard enough . this is one of those films that could have certainly been better .		5		0
i never knew anything about or even heard of bettie page until i saw this movie . and i think it 's decent for a hbo flick but nothing amazing but still a decent watch . now bettie page was america 's sensational pin-up girl during the 50 's that was notorious for her bondage picks which are pretty tame in today 's standards . and the setting is in a period when censorship was very tough , to the point some politicians were claiming that pornographic images are worse than communism . like the title what drives this movie is the characters of bettie page . although it goes in a straightforward biographical film from how she was a young christian to how she became a pin-up girl . and bettie page is a interesting character and despite her very naive personality she was a likable person . because despite the hardships she faced and major sexual harassment she got from a young age , she still has this bright and cheerful personality about her . and how she still has kind and friendly nature towards everyone without being bitter despite her circumstances . the directing style is slightly unique as well . it has this retro feel to it and when bettie is in new york it 's black and white to bring about that period feel . and when she is in miami it 's colored but still has that retro visuals . overall this is a alright watch but nothing all that entertaining or engrossing for a movie about the life of a pin-up girl . everyone 's performances were just excellent especially gretchen mol who really captures the essence of bettie page . 5.5 / 10		5		0
the first , and worst , sequel to die hard -lrb- until die hard 4 , if you count that as a real die hard film -rrb- , is terrorized by the same plot as the original . while waiting for his wife 's plane to arrive at dulles airport -lrb- on xmas eve -rrb- , mcclane notices a few suspicious exchanges between a group of men amidst the busy yuletide passengers . before you know he is neck deep in trouble with an army of mercenaries , led by colonel stewart -lrb- william sadler -rrb- , who are hell-bent on setting free a corrupt south american baron -lrb- franco nero -rrb- . there are more bad guys than before . and more suspension of disbelief is required . there are so many plot holes and illogical moments that the film almost drowns in its own absurdity . but there is enough action and stunts to cancel it out and distract our attention . though they not presented in a breathtaking or memorable way . it 's all too generic and a bit mean-spirited . no audience nowadays would be satisfied with it so prepare yourself for 80 's violence with lots of superfluous f-bombs . william sadler and franco nero lack the callous efficiency of alan rickman . and a hero can only be measured by his nemesis . but most of the time mcclane is just capping off nameless mercs . how boring . tho this should not be blamed on sadler , he has a threatening and intense presence and as he has proved himself in movies like trespass and demon knight . too bad his character here is so badly written and underdeveloped . i 'm sorry but blowing up 250 people off-screen to show how evil you are just wo n't cut it . this movie without a doubt certified renny harlin as an action director . it was a tough , and huge , movie to pull off . only he just did it off with no particular charm , it 's very workman-like . though he does a wonderful job of capturing the look and feel of an east coast winter . the wide-open and ice-covered runways will definitely make you feel chilly and gives it a more look than the first film . although this is another problem . the first die hard worked entirely within the space of nakatomi plaza . it was claustrophobic and almost plausible . the scale and scope of die hard 2 is too big for its own good . the staples of reality are ripped out with ignorance and over-confidence . the bulk of the film is nothing but one dumb action scene after another . it does n't make for coherent viewing . die hard 2 is a definite lag in between both of mctiernan 's very strong outings . by today 's standards it seems dated and very 90 's . which is a shame considering the original and ` with a vengeance ' are , in a way , ` timeless ' . it 's movies like this that inspired ` last action hero ' .		5		0
i 've always liked the off-center vision in the coen brothers ' movies but after the collapse of enron and other boardroom scandals , `` the hudsucker proxy '' seems torn from the headlines with little ornamentation . there are some clever touches , of course : paul newman playing against type as the bad guy behind the scenes , jennifer jason leigh -lrb- with only slight exaggeration -rrb- as the ruthless investigative reporter who will do anything to get her story , and tim robbins as an innocent schmo who wandered on to wall street from muncie indiana with the next big idea : the hula hoop . no actual pensioners seem to have been injured in the making of this movie . however , the coen brothers have fallen a long way short of the reality in this case . the greed displayed by newman and his fellow members of the hudsucker board is nickel and dime stuff compared to what 's been going on the past few years . i came back to this movie accidentally almost five years on and did n't remember having seen it . that may say something about my memory but it also says something about the movie . the enron scandal is long past but `` the hudsucker proxy '' is no better the second time around . this is n't the only coen brothers movie to fall short , but i do n't remember another movie by the duo that i found less interesting or less amusing . and on second viewing , it seems less `` torn from the headlines '' than just plain ordinary .		5		0
when samuel l. jackson gives you `` that look , '' you do n't wan na be on the receiving end of it . jackson is abel turner , a widower and strict , old-school father with two young kids . he lives in lakeview terrace , a modern los angeles suburb . he 's an eccentric cop , who likes to patrol the neighborhood at night and make those sinister sam jackson eyes at people . and he 's a racist . shades of pacific heights -lrb- with michael keaton , 1990 -rrb- and arlington road -lrb- with jeff bridges , 1999 -rrb- , lakeview terrace puts jules winnfield from pulp fiction in a quaint suburban setting , and lets him live like his wallet : a bad . chris and lisa -lrb- patrick wilson and kerry washington -rrb- , a frisky , young interracial couple , move in next door to abel and inflame his old-school ire by being white and black and married . when they bonk in their pool in view of abel 's peeping-tom kids , he gets his jules on and asks chris for an apology while giving him `` that look , '' which seems totally reasonable - i would n't want to see patrick wilson 's pasty torso slamming into kerry washington 's freaky ebony either . but other tensions build and discomfort settles like a jheri curl wig on jules 's head : abel 's yard lights shine directly into chris and lisa 's bedroom , abel verbally attacks chris and lisa 's party guests with his type a personality , chris and lisa discover acts of vandalism around their property , abel hosts a rowdy all-night stag party ... chris and lisa know abel is terrorizing them , but can not tell anyone . who you gon na call ? abel is the . when it gets so uncomfortable that chris has to warn abel , `` get off my property ! '' abel 's rejoinder is , `` or what ?! '' and `` that look . '' mention race in los angeles , and no one is thinking about the l.a. marathon . even in an upper-class suburb in 2008 . it takes chris awhile to deduce that abel might just be acting out on his resentment against seeing a white man `` married to dark meat . '' in his closing argument in a time to kill -lrb- which also starred sam jackson -rrb- , matthew mcconaughey described a horrific rape and torture of a little black girl , then turned the tables on his listeners by saying , `` now imagine she 's white . '' it was a stinging slap in the face to us viewers and his jurors alike . because we 're all racist . whether we know it or not , whether we like it or not ; it is an evolutionary trait that makes us wary of differences . in lakeview , they 've done the mcconaghey - turned the tables on racism to make the black cop the intolerant bigot , so at first we allow abel 's racism to run a little due to uncle tom and blah blah . but we realize that racism is unacceptable no matter which side it poisons from . abel has his demons , dealing with his wife 's death due to a white man . and - let 's face it - he misses vincent vega . but that 's no reason to go off the rails into hollywood killer territory in the third act . neil labute directs , successfully creating palpable tension , then blowing it all in the final sequence in a pat shoot-em-up wrap . writers david loughery and howard korder seemed like they either ran out of juice or the studio suits wanted an ending with sizzle for their . i 'd bet the latter . if only sam jackson could 've been at those meetings to give them `` that look '' ... -- review by poffy the cucumber -lrb- for poffy 's movie mania -rrb- .		5		0
in 2009 , quentin tarantino spiced up the holocaust with inglourious basterds . last year , they tried spicing up abraham lincoln in abraham lincoln : vampire hunter , and it did n't work . now they are turning hansel and gretel into witch hunters in , you guessed it , hansel and gretel : witch hunters . it 's a step up from abe lincoln , which i thought was a big letdown because i loved the book . but this movie suffers from nearly everything that that movie did . it 's amazing that they got talents like famke janssen -lrb- what ? -rrb- , peter stormare -lrb- what ? -rrb- , gemma arterton -lrb- what ?! -rrb- , and jeremy renner -lrb- wtf !!! -rrb- in this contraption . i 'm disappointed that all of you stooped to this low of a level . not just you four but the rest of america , because you gave it money . for everyone , it is just a quest for cash . renner is bored , hence why he is even here in the first place . perhaps in the hands of someone like terry gilliam or tim burton this might have worked . h & g is a movie that is trying to be other movies but it just is n't . there 's nothing memorably funny about this , or anything memorable at all for that matter . it 's sort of interesting but i really could n't help but scratch my head . 80 minutes feels like two hours . the acting is somewhat bland , and nobody gets anything to work with here . i guarantee that the thought process of this movie involved a guy playing a video game for a few hours . because that is what watching this feels like . all this thing needs is a better script to get this cooking . oh well , maybe in the sequel . c		5		0
rabid is set in canada & starts as hart read -lrb- hart moore -rrb- & his girlfriend rose -lrb- marilyn chambers -rrb- are riding a motorbike along a country road when they spin off the road & crash as hart looses control of the bike while trying to avoid hitting a broken down camper van . the accident is seen by patients at the nearby keloid clinic who raise the alarm , with the nearest hospital miles away dr. dan keloid -lrb- howard -rrb- decides to operate at his private clinic but uses new experimental skin grafts on rose who has been badly injured in the crash . rose makes a full recovery but the skin grafts have an unexpected & unwanted side-effect as a mutant growth under rose 's arm has developed & drinks human blood to survive . rose now needs human blood to live although anyone that she drinks from then becomes infected with a rabies like disease that makes the carrier go crazy & seek human blood themselves . as the disease spreads the military place montréal under martial law ... also known under the title rage this canadian production was written & directed by david cronenberg & rabid was his second full length feature film after the successful yet controversial shivers -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , while not one of his best films rabid is still a pretty good horror film with that added depth that cronenberg likes to bring to his films . the sexual metaphors that cronenberg was fond of putting into his films are clearly here with rose seducing & enticing her victims like lovers , the round bodily orifice that the predatory organ shoots out of looks like an anus & maybe cronenberg was thinking about the spread of sexual disease as the imagery & themes all fit together , however rabid is n't as deep or shocking or relevant as many of his other films & the ideas that are brought up are never really explored with the same sort of perverse fascination that he does in some of his other films . rabid just feels a bit empty as a cronenberg film & the dialogue is also a bit dull at times & without purpose or biting social commentary that cronenberg can excel in even though it 's still probably better than many films out there . at 90 odd minutes the pace is a little slow at times but the build-up & spread of the disease is well handled which eventually leads to mass panic & martial law during the last half an hour , i also have to mention the very bleak , sudden & downbeat ending which i thought fitted the tone & style of the film perfectly as rose was tossed away like a piece of trash . i liked rabid , i did n't love it or think it was great cronenberg but his films are never less than interesting . shot on a fairly low budget rabid looks quite gritty & raw at times which helps the tone & feel of the film & suits the story . there 's not much gore here , there are a few bites , a guy is gorily gunned down , someone gets a pneumatic drill in his leg , a doctor cuts a nurses finger off , a strip of skin is sliced from a leg & there 's some blood splatter . there 's a pretty cool car crash as a big lorry smashes into a car that has just fallen off a bridge & the scenes of a panic stricken city are reasonably convincing although budget issues clearly had an effect here . filmed in canada the production values are a bit rough at times with library music but it 's more than watchable & adds a certain grittiness to the film . the acting is alright , no-one is amazing but most of the actors here are at least competent . rabid is a good film , maybe a little disappointing & empty if you are familiar with & his other films but still more than worth watching for a vampire zombie thriller horror film .		5		0
this new version of the brilliant charles bronson original has some of that movie 's scenes more or less copied into its plot , but without knowing its a remake , you 'd be forgiven for thinking you were watching transporter 4 . jason statham is arthur bishop , a cold blooded hit-man who makes assassination attempts look like accidents and circumstance . but to look at statham strutting around fit and tough as nails , he could be playing frank martin or chev . as far as action movie star is concerned , hollywood belongs to statham . but the plot does n't offer anything new , and ben foster struggles to make something of his psycho role despite being great in movies like hostage and the recent remake of the 3:10 to yuma . what is good about the mechanic remake is the action and fight sequences , they are entertaining and thrilling , but afterwards you come away from the cinema with a kind of seen it all before attitude . would hollywood please stop making rehashes of classic originals ? cal .		5		0
the formula of asian horror movies is getting very is another movie which uses that formula and , because of that , i did not like takes an interesting main concept but the development is boring and it takes a lot of clichés from the asian formula of the horror cinema.the movie committed two fatal mistakes besides being boring : i found it weak on the character development and it did not scare me even , this movie lacks of sutherland is a good actor but he does what he can with his role.a positive element i found on this movie is that it has some good gory scenes.i had faith on this movie because director alexandre aja was behind it.he had made the excellent horror film high tension in which he had shown unusual ability for working in the horror , aja failed in here.i wish him better luck with his next project because , in high tension , he showed is a boring horror film.the formula of asian horror films is getting very do not recommend this movie.it 's not bad but it 's pretty mediocre .		5		0
the first half-hour is quite well done . hepburn is excellent as the plain jane whose brave exterior hides an aching heart . that the sleekly handsome taylor would suddenly pay her attention is almost too good to be true . for the sheltered girl , it 's a cinderella dream come true . the washington dc party scenes are particularly well done , just the sort of thing mgm was skilled at , and watching her keep up a brave façade among the snobs while hiding deep insecurity is particularly affecting . but then the movie goes into a dark psychological phase , and it 's mainly downhill from then on . there 's nothing plausible about ann 's -lrb- hepburn -rrb- obsession with a mysterious michael -lrb- mitchum -rrb- , especially while she 's married to prince charming alan -lrb- taylor -rrb- . it 's clearly a plot contrivance and a clumsy one , at that . and catch that sequence where alan tries to kill ann while they 're on horseback . it 's about as poorly staged and edited as any action sequence i 've seen . in particular , the progression of backgrounds does n't come close to matching , creating a rather surreal effect . in my book , lb mayer 's mgm was the wrong studio to do this kind of dark material . too bad mayer did n't pass the story over to a budget outfit like columbia or rko . they would have turned out a fast efficient little noir , which is what the material is really suited for . the trouble here is that mgm casts two of its biggest celebrity stars in the lead . hepburn and taylor are fine performers , but their super-star status required lots of screen time , so the movie gets padded to an often redundant two hours , which does n't help . it 's also an odd role for mitchum given his later screen persona . of course , it 's still early in the tough guy 's career , and a year away from his defining role as the noirish jeff in out of the past -lrb- 1947 -rrb- . still , seeing him in a bland part that any number of lesser actors could have handled takes some getting used to . he 's lucky he went from here to the eccentric rko , while i 'm wondering where his career would have gone had he stayed with glamorous mgm . all in all , the melodrama itself is a turgid disappointment despite the first half-hour and the amount of talent involved .		5		0
my primary interest in this was as a foundation of cinema ; so an academic interest , but - having influenced so many things i am very keen on - not without some excitement at the prospect of discovery of this early common source . so much of cinema flows out from this ; a host of recognizable names tutored on set - von stroheim , tod browning , woody van dyke , victor fleming , elmer clifton , jack conway , king vidor - and even more once the film rippled across the world . in moscow , it was the raw material film students were given to dismantle in lev kuleshov 's fledgling film school , the first ever . and in france abel gance must have been awe-struck by the sheer size of the canvas , if his own films offer any clue . so yes , a fast-paced , lavish blockbuster - it cost at the time an unprecedented $ 2m to make - with literally a cast of thousands animating history , the story of hollywood excess begins here - in italy it had started earlier , with their roman spectacles . the filmmaker as god , who does not simply photograph reality but constructs entire worlds , permits our vision to travel in the places that we could earlier only imagine . but the fundamental technique is still from the theatre ; that means a grand stage - elevated from us , separate - with every now and then a different backdrop , actors who pantomime sweeping emotion , the eye usually fixed in a distance . oh the camera moves , but it moves with the stage . and what a grand stage it is . i suppose it must have been desirable at the time when cinema , and so the possibilities of seeing , made the world feel so new and perhaps so alive again , when so many of the trials and heroism of the world narrative were yet to be immortalized in this new way , that a film like this should try to encompass so much ; the crucifixion , medieval france , ancient babylon , they 're all urgently envisioned in the same space . it is in more ways than one that griffith wrote the history of cinema then ; by pioneering what he did in terms of a film language , but also by creating a vast expanse - a daunting 3 hours of film - that fills the prehistoric void , in terms of cinema , with a cachet of images . now with the pharisees or at the persian camp of cyrus , the court of catherine or the harems of babylon , common streets old and new ; now we could point back and see , in a small measure , a history of film gathered in one place . so , when kuleshov had tasked his students to rework the film , the choice was wise . there is so much here in terms of images , and so fertile for remodeling , that essentially he was presenting them with the empty sheet to write music on - that music , a deeply modernist product of synthesis , we called montage . what does this filmmaker - as god - see though , what kind of worldview does he spring into life , this is more interesting i believe . the title summarizes well . so , a cruel - but institutionalized , thus state sanctioned - evil threatening to engulf and dissolve all that is kind , which is the individual life , and of course the warm sentimentality that eventually restores faith in the personal struggle . but nothing casts a shadow in this world , no depth or dimension beyond the plainly conceivable . so the people are straight-forward beings , either good or bad - our heroine is simply called the dear one - or misguided at their most complex ; or , when en masse , they are part of the decor , collectively writhing in some extravagant background . by the end , a heavenly chorus of angels illuminate the sky above a battlefield . the immediate contrast , like so much in the film , disarms with how much painstaking vision must have gone into making something so splendorous yet so naive . we can pretend like we ought to make amends with the time it was made , just like we ca n't pretend to look away with indifference , but the point remains ; far more complex works of art had been made before , far less didactic about their humanitarian values . you should at least see the segment with the siege of babylon though , and the final scenes cross-cutting across time and space as we rush to the climax ; it 's things like these that so much was founded on . -lrb- and another image that i recommend to those of you who have been charting all this ; it is an inexplicable , tight close-up of the girl who is almost brushing , breathing into the camera . it happens once , and suggests intimacy that is never again encountered in the film . it 's as though the girl , and so this cinema , is yearning to cross over into a new kind of film where faces hold all the mysteries and performances visualize innermost soul . jean epstein would make those films , ushering us in a new perception -rrb-		5		0
i ca n't say i 'm an expert -lrb- or a fan -rrb- of the fifties ` big bug ' movies , but apparently they were quite popular . we had ants in 1954 -lrb- them ! -rrb- , spiders in 1955 -lrb- tarantula -rrb- and apparently someone thought it would be a good idea to do the same thing with scorpions in 1957 ; thus we get the black scorpion . the film basically follows the common formula for these big bug movies , and that 's basically the problem as anyone who has seen another big bug movie before going into this one -lrb- which will be just about everyone who sees this film seeing as it 's not one of the must see genre entries -rrb- will have seen it all before . once again , the film shows an effect on the environment brought on by some unlikely event -lrb- in this case , its volcanic activity -rrb- . the effect is , of course , that a bunch of scorpions living underground are freed ; but the difference between these scorpions and normal scorpions is that these ones happen to be absolutely gigantic and thus them being freed means bad news for everyone in the vicinity . naturally , one of the most important things about this film is the effects on the central monsters ; and while they do look cheap and unconvincing , the effects actually are n't all that bad for 1957 and i was pleasantly surprised ... that is , up until we start getting shots of the scorpions ' faces . scorpions are actually a creature that i know something about as i 've kept them as pets ; and it would seem that the filmmakers knew something about them too , as shown by the way the scorpions in this film move and attack their prey ... only while mine attack locusts and crickets , the ones in this film attack helicopters and things ; but at least the method is the same . the film does have some human interest in the form of the people researching and trying to stop the scorpions and there 's a little love story in there too ; but it really could n't be any less interesting and it 's clear that director edward ludwig 's sole intention was to cash in as much as possible on the big bug craze . the film goes for the big ending and seeing the army move in on the monster is good enough for that ; but even so , this is clearly a lesser example of the genre and i would only recommend it to those who have enjoyed similar and superior films such as them and tarantula .		5		0
wayne 's world as a brief snl skit was always quite hilarious , and the first movie was one of the better ones made from an snl skit . however by the time this movie had made it to cable tv , the entire concept just seemed way over done . having a profitable movie can cause these types of situations . of course a sequel will be made , and then the goal is keeping the material fresh , and finding new things for your characters to do . wayne 's world 2 is really just a rehashing of the same ideas from the original mixed with numerous cameos , other movie references , and ideas that just do n't always pay off with the laughter that myers may have intended . the story picks up with wayne and garth still doing their public access tv show , just like in the original . wayne is still jealous of his girlfriend cassandra 's career and male attention , just like in the original . in order to prove his own worth , wayne decides to throw a huge outdoor music festival to apparently make things right with the world again . things culminate with the appearance of aerosmith making their second cameo of the movie . there are some truly funny moments that mostly involve chris farley as a roadie wan na be , and garth trying to woo kim basinger . christopher walken 's appearance is welcome of course as a romantic rival for cassandra 's affection . also a funny cameo from james hong as her father . alas , the magic just is n't there this time , and it was certainly time for mike myers to move on from this character . penelope spheeris was not on board this time as she , like so many others , found mike myers impossible to work with . now after the failure of the love guru , it is unclear if myers has anything new left in him . if wayne 's world 2 comes on , you might want to keep hitting buttons on your remote control every few minutes to see if something better is out there . 5 of 10 stars . the hound .		5		0
i 've seen trashier movies and have guiltier pleasures in seeing them than valley of the dolls . but many people swear by this film as the trashiest of all and who am i to argue . not that jacqueline susann ever pretended to write anything but commercial potboilers . those who bought her books saw her films and that of harold robbins as well . susann hung around the world of show business and knew a whole lot of people both in their public and private lives . i wo n't say who the various characters are based on , but i think if one has a good knowledge of our culture , one can identify who they are . the book centers around three young women who live at the famous martha washington hotel for women in new york city and all become famous and involved in show business in various ways . barbara parkins starts as a secretary in a theatrical agency and gets ` discovered ' there by soap magnate charles drake . she 's also involved with agent paul burke , but neither can quite commit . in the meantime parkins becomes famous for her soap commercials . the tragic sharon tate is beautiful , but talentless . she uses her looks quite successfully to get by . after using a number of older sugar daddies to support her in good style , she falls for nightclub singer tony scotti whose career is managed , would be better , by his sister lee grant . tate thinks she 's found true love , but tragedy awaits on screen and in real life when tate fell into the cross-hairs of the murderous manson family . patty duke is the very talented one who gets kicked out of a broadway show by jealous older star susan hayward , but that kind of talent ca n't be hidden long . but duke starts abusing all kinds of substance and gets way out of control . she exacts a measure of revenge somewhat over hayward , but it really does n't do her much good in the end . they both end up the same way , but hayward has quite a bit more perspective on it . the attraction for me in this film is susan hayward who shines even in high gloss trash . your breath is taken away at how all the players know they 're in junk , but go at it with a bravura style . valley of the dolls got an oscar nomination for john williams for his musical scoring . andre and dory previn wrote some serviceable numbers for the film , nothing more . it 's trash , but i love it .		5		0
juno was not nearly as good as i thought it would be . it is so over rated . people make this movie out to be such an original movie with great heart . first off its not original , they copied most of the story right off of knocked up which was very good . second off their was n't that much heart besides for juno and her friend pauly . the acting in this movie was really really good but i did n't think that ellen paige deserved to be up for any academy awards . the critics did like this movie along with the other movie about pregnancy . it seems to me like the critics like pregnancy type of movies . it was a very funny movie though do n't get me wrong . it was a great teen comedy movie as well . i just think that i found ellen paige very annoying in this movie . some of the phrases they used in this were very corny . it was very cute and had some great meaning but at the same time it was pretty boring . i guess i did n't like it as much maybe because im a teenage guy . this might be a movie more for girls . i think it was just not my kind of movie . i think that this movie was a great way to show teens what really can happen at this age . teenagers today they do n't wear protection as much as they should , just like in this movie . i really did like michael cera in this movie though . i think once again he did a great job . he really saves this movie in my opinion for me . toward the end of this movie i was finding my self very bored . i would have to say that this was one of the happy , feel good movies of 2007 . i ca n't make fun of this movie just because i did n't like it as much as i wished i would have . the critics liked it and it seems to me like everyone i ask liked it to . i just found that one of the messages in this movie was saying that its okay to go ahead and get pregnant at this age . at the same time they were also showing you what getting pregnant can do to you . overall this was a very liked movie by most people . i think that you should definitely see this movie and just get a glimpse of how real this movie was .		5		0
-lrb- r # 43 -rrb- `` worst movie of all time '' ? no , actually one of the most insane and hilarious spoofs ever made . not much of a plot , obviously low budget , non-actors doing the best they can to keep the dialogue deadpan and serious -lrb- george wilson as the bad guy is particularly hilarious -rrb- , and of course rampaging , evil , flesh-eating tomatoes . in the tradition of david zucker 's scary movies , james de bello 's jokes aim to be as shamelessly stupid , but still funny , as possible . and it worked for me . some lines literally had me howling with laughter . `` could somebody pass the ketchup ? '' ; `` ! '' ; `` technically , tomatoes are fags '' ; `` well , it was pretty dark , you know ... it 's lighter today '' ; `` why not ? you 're a woman ! '' , just to name a few . and how can you not love a movie that features a catchy john theme song , a deliberately badly dubbed japanese scientist , an insane wwii pilot who seems to drop from out of no where and just sort of follows along , a blind policeman , a president whose main job seems to be writing his signature on papers before crumpling them and throwing them away , a organization who spends the entire movie debating what should be done about the tomatoes before deciding it 's not time to take action yet , a swimming champion who eats an entire bowl of the cereal `` steroids '' , mind-numbing musical numbers , the list goes on . you 'd have to be a pretty dull person not to enjoy this . utterly insane , shamelessly cheap and silly , but somehow awesome . i 'd recommend this movie to anyone with a knowledge of awful movies and a good sense of humour . `` ...

taking obvious influence from films such as dirty harry , cobra tells the story of a maverick cop determined to bring down a cult that are brutally murdering members of the local population . sylvester stallone stars as marion `` cobra '' cobretti , the sunglass wearing action hero extraordinaire with , you guessed it , a bad attitude . stallone gets to chew on lots of cheesy dialogue , as does the rest of the cast , which is most probably down to the fact that stallone wrote it . starring alongside stallone is andrew robinson , whom horror fans will recognise instantly from the simply sublime british horror flick ; hellraiser . andrew also starred in the aforementioned dirty harry , which , as i said ; this film took it 's premise , although none of what made it good . overall , the film is corny and it has almost nothing that you could n't find somewhere else , and done better than it is here . one of the worst things about the movie is its use of music , which is alarmingly awful . the 80 's has never been known for good music , and this film is a testament as to why . i do n't know why they would want to use the music the way it is used in this film , in any film . silly songs over corny acting has never , and will never work . despite all that i 've said so far ; this film does have some redeeming qualities that come in the form of the set pieces that ensue when the evil cult that stallone is working against are chasing their victims . there are shots of them opening up cars and axing the people inside , one scene sees a man bash a door down with a knife and his foot to get at the girl inside etc. . some of them are genuinely suspenseful , and my only qualm is that it cuts out before the ` money shot ' -lrb- we do n't get to see the gore -rrb- . the film also features a standard -lrb- for this type of film -rrb- car chase . the one here is extremely over the top . sometimes , being over the top can work , but it was just too over the top . big vans exploding with a couple of shots , stallone manoeuvring his car into reverse and back again in motion , and in an instant , and more all feature . despite it 's small redeeming features , cobra is n't really worth watching and i would only recommended it to people with nothing better to do .		5		0
this sequel to the smash hit movie beverly hills cop takes the murphy character back to los angeles to solve a case of ` alphabet ' crimes . unfortunately , bhc2 is another one of those ordinary sequels that got made just because its predecessor was such a huge hit , therefore lacking the quality of the original . the major mistake of the movie comes from the storyline , which contains more bullets and not enough hilarity . there are a few funny bits , though , such as john ashton falling into a swimming pool and the scene where murphy picks on playboy ladies man hugh hefner , but the movie 's good moments ca n't compete with lousy acting or a crummy script . 2 out of 5		5		0
`` red dawn '' is a lukewarm remake of a classic with an incredibly stupid story line when north korean invaders attack the united states of america with the help of the russians and impose their ideology . a few young men seek refuge in the forests and try to fight the invaders by organizing a guerrilla . in the beginning , they are very unexperienced and a few of them wo n't survive their brave acts which leads to important tensions within the team but the guerrilla gets better and better and finally decides to attack the main building of the enemies . the positive thing about the movie is its short length and the fact that it never gets boring . the dialogues and the acting are a little bit weak but better than i would have expected . the action scenes are a little bit ordinary in the beginning but get better and better towards the explosive and entertaining end . i also liked the fact that the ending was rather surprising and dramatic . it 's not your usual happy end and included two rather sad scenes even though the final message happens to be positive and warlike again . on the negative side , the story is completely stupid and unreal and the movie 's intentions are not a far call from propaganda movies of the cold war which feels rather inappropriate in modern times of globalization . the american screenwriters still seem to think that their government is the best in the world and that anybody who disagrees such as communists are automatically evil . this kind of movie only supports the propagandistic ideas of the north korean government who takes the americans for their worst enemies . while the north korean government slowly opens for economy , diplomacy and modernization , americans are still stuck in the past and release this kind of questionable movie . some people might identify with the closed minded attitude to fight anything and anybody who attacks your country at all costs and that 's what creates more and more conflicts but i simply ca n't agree on that point . as a german i can only say that i 'm glad that my own country which i still love and respect a lot got defeated during the second world war and i would n't have defended it if i had been able to chose . it 's always a mistake to blindly follow a government and accept anything it asks you to do . american governments have created lots of wars , sometimes with good , sometimes with bad intentions , and it 's strange that such a story line comes from this country because they have n't been the victims apart of 9/11 which was a terrible incident but definitely not a year long war as what happened in korea or vietnam . when arts and politics mix , the final result is always extremely biased and that 's also the case of this movie . i 'm surprised that these kinds of stories are still written today and one simply ca n't ignore this aspect if one watches this film . if there was n't the political dimension of this movie and if the invaders would have been anonymous , i would have given one more point to the flick but this movie is still only of an average quality . in the end , i can only recommend this movie for those who are looking for a patriotic action flick . it 's quite entertaining and gets better and better towards the end but the acting and the story are rather bad . anything who expects a thought out story line or a strong acting should n't watch this movie . if you like war movies , you should go for the korean `` tae guk gi '' who shows you a very balanced and realistic view of what happened during the korean war .		5		0

the story : 1968 , three years after mankind was wiped out by a strange disease . robert morgan , a former scientist , is the sole survivor . he spends his nights barricaded in his house while the remnants of humanity , transformed into vampires by the disease , come howling at his door . during the day , morgan combs the city in an effort to destroy the vampires . in 1954 , budding writer richard matheson wrote a book called `` i am legend '' , which became one of the best sci-fi / horror novels ever made . there have been three different films adapted from the book , this film being the first . matheson wrote the script himself . the film was originally planned to have been made by the british hammer studios but was canned when it ran into censorship problems . as a result , the italians took the script & filmed it on the cheap . where , i hear you ask ? in italy , of course ! while this film may have been made on the cheap , as a horror film it does succeed on it 's own , limited terms . there is a certain effectiveness to have vincent price going about his daily routine , if you call what he does routine , going to a deserted supermarket to replenish his garlic supply , making stakes on a wood lathe , then searching the city , killing vampires as they sleep . the film does have the usual problems associated with many low-budget films , with sound drop-outs , poor continuity & awkward pauses on the soundtrack . the film also preserves the book 's ending intact .		5		0
this is a haunting , well-produced , well-acted ` story ' of a host of irredeemable characters in what has to be one of the ugliest and most god-forsaken areas on earth . as the policeman , capt. stanley , ray winstone is the closest any of the male characters get to being human . yet he is as flawed as can be . he and his wife -lrb- played woodenly by emily watson -rrb- live in a fantasy home stocked with their treasures from an apparently more civilized past . stanley tries to shelter his wife from the stark evil all around them , but can not . the ` heroes ' of this tale are a gang of murderous rapists , led by older brother arthur -lrb- danny huston -rrb- . middle brother charlie -lrb- guy pearce -rrb- is pressed by stanley to kill arthur in exchange for considerations for charlie himself and the youngest brother , mikey , who is apparently a congenital idiot . the police are , of course , a pack of sadistic cowards who periodically go about killing blacks for sport . in the process of playing out this tale of hatred and revenge we are treated to , floggings , heads blowing apart , decapitations , slashings , rapes , stabbings , and rotting corpses . a brief appearance by john hurt appears to have been thrown in as a afterthought , with no effect on the ` story ' . we are not privy to the motivations of any of these people , and we can empathize with none of them , even the wife , who seems to live in a dream world . she tries , but fails , to rise above the relentlessly hideous landscape , that is occupied by human filth and hordes of flies . the whole affair is expertly filmed . this is a long drawn out bloodbath of a ` story ' poorly told with lingering shots of no moment , and with no real reason to watch . spare yourself .		5		0
ted striker is the test pilot on a new lunar shuttle craft , but when he reports its faults the company blame his history of combat stress and he is institutionalised . on the eve of the new shuttle 's launch he must escape the funny farm and warn everyone of the danger . i 'm a big fan of the original airplane and this sequel is more of the same goofy gags , enjoyable puns and non sequiturs , as well as a general pastiche of ham acting and disaster and science-fiction movies . the cast are all good sports , with many of the original players reprising their roles -lrb- bridges is the best -rrb- , some wacky cameos -lrb- burr as a judge , bono as a mad bomber -rrb- and most enjoyably , a hilarious appearance by shatner who good-naturedly spoofs his own neurotic captain kirk sensibilities . it 's not as funny as the first movie for me , partly since leslie nielsen is absent , but mostly because it 's pretty much a stream of gags , with only some satire of the form . what 's really funny about this subject material i think is that people make -lrb- and watch -rrb- movies like airport 1975 or outbreak and pretend they 're serious . roland emmerich 's films are great fun but also faintly ridiculous , but that quality is part of their appeal -lrb- at least for me -rrb- . airplane ii has some great jokes and satire of other movies and tv shows -lrb- notably invasion of the body snatchers and 2001 -rrb- for the savvy viewer but is not as good at spoofing disaster flicks in general . nevertheless , an agreeably daft little movie with some fine deadpan acting .		5		0
horror movies with malevolent vehicles can be very good -lrb- duel -rrb- or very bad -lrb- death ship -rrb- but are usually somewhere in the middle . the hearse is a definite middle-ground offering , featuring -lrb- surprise , surprise -rrb- a large hearse which relentlessly pursues a lady newly arrived in the unwelcoming town of blackford . the film 's title could just as easily be changed to the haunted house , since whenever the titular hearse is n't trying to terrorise her , the same lady finds herself spooked by ghostly goings-on in the giant mansion she has recently inherited . in fact , it is this of purpose that is the film 's main drawback ... is it a haunted house film or a possessed vehicle film ? no-one seems to have made a final decision about this and , by trying to be a bit of both , it spreads its net rather too wide and ends up not quite working as either . still an intriguing and watchable little screamer , but not quite as good as it had the potential to be . jane hardy -lrb- trish van devere -rrb- , a big city woman on the mend after a serious emotional breakdown due to the collapse of her marriage , heads out into the country after inheriting her aunt 's mansion in the small town of blackford . she has barely arrived in the town when a large black hearse smashes into her car and away from the scene of the accident . the townspeople are generally unwelcoming and unfriendly towards jane , including the lawyer , walter pritchard -lrb- joseph cotton -rrb- , dealing with the acquisition of the mansion . after taking up temporary residence in the house , jane soon experiences a number of unsettling happenings , including glimpses of a ghostly presence that looks like her aunt , objects which appear to move themselves in the night , and the unexpected appearance of the hearse from time to time on her driveway . jane soon discovers that her aunt was reviled throughout the time as a devil worshipper , and on the day of her funeral the hearse carrying her body to the graveyard was involved in an unexplained tragic accident . could there be a link or are all these terrifying events just the product of her emotionally unstable state of mind ? van devere is pretty good in the film , playing the character persuasively enough -lrb- even if she does seem unconvincingly resilient -- sticking around , alone , in the house , even after it becomes clear malevolent spirits are out to get her -rrb- . director george bowers throws some ok jump moments at the audience , mainly involving sudden shock cuts in which we catch a fleeting glimpse of a ghostly apparition through some window or mirror or such like . the story plays out quite slowly , which is not always a bad thing -lrb- character-driven horror films can be among the best of the lot when done right , such as the exorcist and rosemary 's baby -rrb- ... but in this case , it often feels like the slowness is due to padding rather than real character & story development . the hearse is a fair horror entry ; there 's no real reason to compel you to watch it , but there 's no reason you should avoid it either .		5		0
and yes , mr. baxley , i 'm talking to you . you of all people should have read the book . you did , after all , direct the movie . before i go on , i should tell you that i actually found craig baxley 's film rendering of stephen king 's novel to be very entertaining , even though it took place almost a century after the book took place , dealing with almost nothing from the novel . but that 's okay , they made a prequel for that . this movie is about a professor who just about stakes her career , and definitely her reputation , on her ability to find actual paranormal phenomena going on at the legendary rose red , a big bad haunted house . rose red is certainly a bad house . we get enough of the history of the mansion to know that it 's a bad house . it seems to actually be alive and in control of its own body , altering its construction and adding entire new wings at will . you might say it 's sarah winchester and the winchester mystery house combined . the story was , obviously , based on the san jose mansion and almost filmed there . the idea was scrapped for whatever reason , and filmed in tacoma instead , not that it matters , i suppose , since whatever mansion they used would probably have been augmented tremendously with visual effects anyway . the story concerns the above-mentioned professor bringing together an entire team of what you might call high profile paranormal phenomena experts , some more willing to attend than others , in the hopes that with such a collection of abilities she might increase her chances of conjuring up genuine paranormal activity in the mansion and thus resuscitate her reputation and perhaps even generate national recognition . as is to be expected , a rival professor has sent along a spy to bring down her plans . so far so good , i guess . this is the premise for what could be a good haunted house movie , but the two most pressing problems are that a haunted house movie has a long haul ahead of it in order to achieve something innovative , and the other problem is that this is not what the book is about upon which the miniseries is based . i suppose that little detail can be overlooked , since the miniseries focuses on the future as a haunted house of the mansion in king 's novel , but the movie really has to justify that leap , and this one really does n't the made-for-tv effects are painfully obvious , mostly all of the visual effects and even the very filming itself having that flat and somehow too smooth quality that i can never figure out how but always reveals how cheap it is . and maybe i 'm wrong , maybe it 's not even cheap , just made for a different medium , but my problem is that it is not nearly as convincing as effects made for the movies . as far as the characters , it 's strange that the one who i think is the most widely disliked is probably the only interesting one among the lot of them . emery waterman , played by matt ross , is the slightly overweight loser stereotype of the group , constantly mumbling and grumbling and complaining and with an overbearing mother and speaking in an almost painfully irritating voice , but at least his character has depth . not many of the others do . stephen king himself turns up once , as he does in just about all of the movies based on his work -lrb- my personal favorite is his hilarious cameo in maximum overdrive -rrb- , here , as always , playing the tiny part of a character that comes on screen just long enough to get treated badly and then shunned . king 's humility is enviable and virtually nonexistent in hollywood these days . rose red , another of stephen king 's lengthy made-for-tv movies , sure to be enjoyed by devoted stephen king fans , although it 's strange that i am a devoted king fan myself and was a little disappointed . i think , however , that i was mainly disappointed because the movie strayed so far from what the book was about , but in retrospect i kind of can appreciate the extra level that that adds to the content of the story . besides sort of removing from the book and showing the haunted mansion far in the future from the time during which the book takes place , it also creates the possibility of a prequel . it 's like they made rose red and rose red ii -lrb- the diary of ellen rimbauer -rrb- in reverse order . i guess you could say that 's pretty clever , i guess , bur unfortunately it 's among the more clever things about either film . i expected more from stephen king , who has of late evolved from the cheesy horror films that were adapted from his books -lrb- such as abysmal films like graveyard shift and creepshow -rrb- to intelligent and often amazingly high-quality films like the shawshank redemption and hearts in atlantis . rose red falls just a bit above one of his latest flops , dreamcatcher . hopefully his next miniseries , desperation , will be better . i certainly have high hopes for the talisman and especially bag of bones .		5		0
the story of this movie is a mess . i had fun watching this one , but that was definitely not because of the story , although it gives us some good single scenes . the most problems i had with the ending which i will not reveal here of course . the problem is that i ca n't think of another ending , one that could have done it for me . basically ben -lrb- ben affleck -rrb- has to choose between his fiancé bridget -lrb- maura tierney -rrb- and sarah -lrb- sandra bullock -rrb- . you know he will have to make that choice the minute sandra bullock appears on screen so i am not giving anything away . the mess that brings affleck to the choice is the movie . bridget and sarah are both lovely characters , as we learn during the first half of the movie . because we know the choice must be made in the end we also know that one of the lovely ladies gets hurt . as the watchers we do not want that so we like the movie less than we could have liked it . my best friend 's wedding with julia roberts had the same kind of choice but that movie had a good answer in the end . the difference was that in my best friend 's wedding the second woman was the best friend of the groom , not some total stranger like sandra bullock is here in the start . sandra bullock is very funny as sarah , a woman who does whatever she wants . we learn that her life is not all joy and fun . steve zahn plays the best man of affleck and has some funny scenes . ben affleck is okay , not great and maura tierney is very lovely . we have enough chemistry between the characters to like this film as a romantic comedy and like i said there are some nice laughs . if you can make yourself ignore the script you will like this film .		5		0
the woman in green is actually a dull , the plot is straight forward but the direction and the plot itself were just not good enough for you to appreciate it . the movie featured sherlock 's holmes arch enemy , professor moriarty who is suppose to be holmes intellectual equal , but in this flick he seemed to look more like a struggling villain trying to live out a fantasy of being the man to kill holmes . the woman in green is a 1945 american crime drama thriller starring sir arthur conan doyle 's detective sherlock holmes , his faithful companion dr. watson and professor moriarty all this characters were created by doyle . the movie is the eleventh film to star both basil rathbone and nigel bruce as sherlock holmes and dr. watson respectively . the movie is not directly based on any of sir arthur conan doyle 's stories and books on sherlock holmes , the movie is credited to have an original screenplay , but several of its scenes can be said to have been lifted from `` the final problem '' and `` the adventure of the empty house . '' the movie plot starts with a string of random murders of women who then have their forefingers severed . these acts made scotland yard think that there is a serial killer on the loose and sherlock is called upon for aid . during his investigation he and watson , stumbled upon a clue after a deceased man 's daughter brought them a forefinger believed to be belonging to one of the dead women . sherlock was able to deduce from the incident that some high power is at play here , not just a mere serial killer . his obsession with the fact moriarty is not dead made him to conclude that moriarty is back and is the man behind all the murders . his believe came true when he got a visit from moriarty himself , and he got another lead in the case when a man was sent to kill him and the man did n't even seem to know what he was doing . although owning all the rathbone/bruce series will be a nice collection for any movie collector , i wo n't try and stop you from collecting this movie , but as i said it is a low for me , the high i got when i saw the hounds of the baskerville 's -lrb- 1939 -rrb- kind of like vanished half way through this one , this post world war ii movie , is a little dry for my taste . www.lagsreviews.com		5		0
the film opens with a seriously flawed -- and boring -- portrayal of the explosion at petersburg ; an intensely interesting event in real history even if told briefly : a group of pennsylvania miners suggested they use their mining ability to build a tunnel to right under the confederate troops and set off a massive explosion . this was carried out successfully in the short-run , but in the immediate aftermath the union troops were standing around watching their deadly handiwork but the confederates reacted quickly with rage and shot down more union troops , with the north thus taking the heavier casualties . the movie says nothing about this , preferring to focus on the rabbit being chased down by troops . the siege at petersburg is a part of the civil war seldom told , seldom with honesty . essentially a standoff , the south kept grant 's troops at bay even though grant 's army outnumbered the south by 12 to 1 and the north 's troops were well armed and well fed while the south 's were starving and ill equipped -- except for their tenacity and courage . another review compares this film to gone with the wind . it 's like comparing burger king to ruth 's chris . i 've seen gwtw maybe 12 times over 50 years . cold mountain is impossible to watch a second time , as it lacks the dramatic interest of , say , a tim holt western .		5		0
aidan breslin is a bitter detective emotionally distanced from his two young sons following the untimely death of his devoted wife . while investigating a series of murders of rare violence , he discovers a terrifying link between himself and the suspects in a chain of murders that seem to be based on the biblical prophecies concerning the four horsemen of the apocalypse : war , famine , pestilence , and death ... michael bays first production of a film that is n't a remake is n't the worst film out there , but it 's trying way too hard to be like ` se7en ' and ends up more like ` the glimmer man ' and is less enjoyable than either one of them . quaid as ever is okay , but looks like he is constipated throughout the film , and has to go through the old cliché of not being able to do anything with his kids because his phone keeps going off . it 's quite unsettling in places , but twenty minutes into the film , you can tell who the killer is , thus destroying any suspense the film could have had . it 's nice to look at in places , even though they have obviously cropped the top of the frame in several scenes due to boom mike visibility . quaid makes the film watchable , but it 's forgettable stuff .		5		0
`` safe haven '' is an unoriginal , cookie cutter , a battered woman runs away , love film . it is basically a stripped down less interesting version of the julia roberts movie of years ago called `` sleeping with the enemy . '' julianna hough plays the battered woman on the run from an abusive husband . of course like all these movies , she runs off to a small town to hide out from her stalker and falls in love with the troubled country bumpkin played by josh duhamel . of course the evil husband finds her , blah blah blah . with out giving it away though , i will say that there is a twist at the end that is definitely interesting . the acting is not horrible in this one . everyone played their plastic roles as they were written ... boringly , clichéd characters . julianna hough is beautiful eye candy , and obviously the ladies will be happy to see josh duhamel ... channing tatum probably turned down , or was unavailable for the role . this movie is just one of hollywoods attempt to make a buck by just taking another successful movie and updating it with fresh young stars that 20 somethings will swoon over , and it as if we have never seen it before . there is a good twist at the very end but the rest is just a standard run of the mill film at best . the top rating i can give this one is a 5 , for a complete lack of originality . it 's not even to successful in the love story part . there is just no reason this film needed to be made at all .		5		0
ultimately , what this film did best was to make me realize that `` the girl next door '' is a good comedy . i never talked about `` the girl next door '' , but always considered it disgusting and uncommitted ; i was wrong . i adored the movie because i was laughing as i hardly laugh , and some people may question the pornographic orientation of the film , but they ca n't deny it is original . `` euro trip '' is funny , in extreme moments , but the way it is done reminds a lot to other films than `` the girl next door '' . a film like `` euro trip '' is in the vein of the one year earlier `` american wedding '' , one of the last good comedies . since its first installment , `` american pie '' proposed music of the most known groups at the time , which was horrible and then got repeated in all of the sequels . then lots of those movies came and it was becoming unbearable ... one year had to go by , and they had to do this movie , with all the songs , the teenage life -lrb- these are grads -rrb- , the friends ' reunions , a trip throughout europe and the characters that they 'll meet and lots of other elements i 'll proceed to explain in detail , like , for example , the joke that keeps on going during the whole film . when lead character scotty -lrb- newcomer scott mechlowicz -rrb- looses his girlfriend fiona -lrb- `` smallville 's '' kristin kreuk -rrb- , he is humiliated in front of the whole senior year at the moment lustra 's lead singer donny -lrb- a refreshing cameo appearance by matt damon -rrb- presents their song : `` this is a song about the craziest , nastiest sex puppet i know ... fiona '' . the song talks about what he and the girl do together every day and the chorus goes by : `` scotty does n't know , scotty does n't know ... '' . this will be repeated each time he meets an individual . with his heart broken , he reads one of the many mails his german friend mieke -lrb- scott calls him mike -rrb- sends him constantly , and notices that he desires to arrange a meeting with him ; he wants to come to the states to visit him . that 's when he recalls how his best friend cooper -lrb- jacob pitts -rrb- has warned him about that , assuring the german friend was gay . scott insults the guy with his response , just to find out the next day that the `` he '' was a `` she '' and to decide to make a trip to germany to find her . ironically they 'll never get to germany , but because of fate they 'll get together with the twins jenny -lrb- michelle trachtenberg -rrb- and jamie -lrb- travis wester -rrb- and fulfill a euro trip . during this time in europe , it is up to writers alec berg , david mandel -lrb- of course it 's not mamet -rrb- and jeff schaffer to make us laugh or not . there are some particular scenes that are very original and therefore funny , and there some typical gross ` impossible not to laugh ' moments . their main love story is not very believable , but serves as an excuse , but the other things involving relationships are well thought . however , laughs come most of the times by the hand of the cast . jacob pitts is a revelation . he is gifted in his timing , unmistakable in his looks , and has that david spade face all over . he steals the piece creating the funniest moments . the other surprise is travis wester as the nerdy and predictable jamie . maybe he was chosen for the role because he is like that in real life , but as i do n't know that for sure , i can say he 's got the moves . and just not to forget , michelle trachtenberg got me in `` harriet the spy '' and she 's managed her career well . nice comedic turn here . the men who wrote the feature also directed it . i wanted to mention that because the credit has to be given . their directing work seems to be more a work of fun than a commitment with film-making ; and i do n't know less i care if they really went to each of europe 's countries . the truth is the movie is not complexly shot and if they actually traveled around europe that would be enough to justify their shooting motives . finalizing , `` eurotrip '' will not mark a tendency in comedies , neither will be remembered as an artistic piece or something similar , but i can guarantee it will open gates for some talented young actors and it wo n't get you bored .		5		0
well thought film detailing the life of joan of arc : a woman no one in france really did not know how to take . after seeing her sister murdered than raped , joan grows up to become a messenger of god to the dauphin of france . meanwhile , france is getting pounded on left , center and right from the english and burgundians . milla 's portrayal of joan was extremely strange , from one minute she was whining , the next she was screaming and acting totally out of it : i guess the result of hearing voices . because of this , the french army are far more enjoying to watch . the dry jokes , and the fun wit of the men seem to show far more acting talent than joan of arc herself . otherwise the film is great , the battles are good , the conspiracy against joan was even better . when the dark , shady figure shows up , the movie is at its best as everything joan believed is literally laughed off . good movie , should have got another joan .		5		0
i 've been watching a series of genuine 1930s gangster films -- `` little caesar '' , `` scarface '' and their ilk . perhaps that 's not the best preparation for viewing a shiny new re-creation of that era , using modern film idiom and equipment ; and perhaps i was subconsciously influenced by the decidedly mediocre newspaper reviews . perhaps i have simply become too far disjointed from the cinema of my own era , due to an overdose of movies . or perhaps `` public enemies '' just is n't that good a film ... for whatever reason , i felt that the gulf between this picture and those earlier productions epitomised a lot of what i find most off-putting about modern cinema : the film was too long , too loud and too violent -lrb- those pre-code films did n't exactly pull their punches when it came to characters beating each other up or hosing each other down with bullets , but somehow they avoided the sense of gratuitous porn -rrb- , the characters insufficiently differentiated -lrb- to the degree that i found it often very confusing as to who exactly they were -rrb- , the dialogue mumbled or slurred , plus a pointless sex scene that contributes nothing to the plot . the film appears to lack any central moral idea ; and by that i do n't mean some kind of lecturing , message about the evils of gangsterism , but the sort of simple central concept that one takes for granted in films of an earlier era , whether it be `` he who lives by the sword , dies by the sword '' , `` friendship is stronger than the law '' or even `` flaunt it , baby , flaunt it ! '' perhaps this is more true to real life , in that things do just randomly happen or not happen without fitting into any particular pattern -- but i find the result disturbingly empty in some way . having seen a number of genuine 30s productions literally days before watching this film , i also found the period setting unconvincing ; presumably they went to some trouble to get appropriate props , costumes , etc , but somehow it rarely felt natural . i 'm used to seeing this era in black and white and not in processed colour , of course -lrb- the rather odd palette must have been a conscious choice -rrb- , but the characters did n't look at home in their costumes , the hair and moustache styles did n't have the familiar 30s air , and the vehicles seemed museum pieces rather than everyday parts of the scenery ... but far more seriously , `` public enemies '' is no `` bonnie & clyde '' , `` butch & sundance '' or even `` thelma & louise '' , because frankly we just do n't care that much about the characters . depp 's performance as dillinger is particularly odd , because the way that this central character is presented by the script seems to be at odds with the way that either depp and/or director michael mann have chosen to play him : we are , from time to jarring time , told about a charismatic , chivalrous , laughing crook who tweaks the tail of the law and is seen by a large section of the public as a folk hero , yet what we actually see is a dour , withdrawn , almost drab individual whose chief selling point appears to be the nonentity that enables him to go unrecognised on at least two occasions . maybe johnny depp is trying hard to shake off the mantle of captain jack sparrow ; but the part is crying out for some of that larger-than-life attraction and charm , and without it the character not only falls flat , but rings false . maybe , again , this is intentional , as an attempt to the gangster myth . but what can not be intentional is the way that dillinger manages to come across as not caring very much about any of the things that are supposed to be prime movers in the plot : we are told that he never lets anyone down , yet he does n't come across as particularly engaged with any of his friends , we are given to understand that he is passionately attached to billie to the exclusion of his own safety -lrb- although , inconveniently , he gets himself killed when he is betrayed by the madam who provides him with one of her ` girls ' -rrb- , yet the affair between them fails to convince , and he does n't even seem particularly interested either in money or in the abstract thrill of lawbreaking itself . in fact he comes over as a dull cold fish , and the result , i 'm afraid , is a lacuna at the heart of the film that has to be laid at depp 's door . he has more than enough acting clout these days to pick and choose his projects and performances , so he must have deliberately set out to present this interpretation , but i have to say i ca n't see what it gains the film . i found this picture distasteful , incoherent , and -- despite or even because of the extended firefights -- tedious . oddly enough the film that i was specifically reminded of was the remake of `` last of the mohicans '' ; i was fascinated to discover that the latter was in fact directed by michael mann , making the resemblance presumably very far from coincidental ! the real killer for me , however , was the scene at the end where dillinger is watching the contemporary gangster picture `` manhattan melodrama '' starring a clark gable with william powell and myrna loy . on the screen we have actors and a fast-moving plot -lrb- we only see a few snippets of the story , but it 's clear what 's happening : gable and powell are old friends now on opposite sides of the law -rrb- , clear lighting , attractive camera-work and , even in so short a space of screen time , actual emotional impact . in the auditorium we have muddy colours , an unattractive dillinger peering obscurely from under his smoked glasses , and a turgid lack of tension in what ought to be the climax of the picture -- i really did n't care that much about him by this stage . it was at this point , i 'm afraid , that i realised that on the evidence , i 'd really rather have been watching `` manhattan melodrama '' itself ...		5		0
the reason why such a great movie can only deserve a mere 5 star is because of a major flaw -- scriptwriting . knowing a little bit about mark zuckerberg and as an engineering student who had spent time with geeks and hardcore programmer back in university days , i can say for sure that this movie just showed how much lack of understanding it has towards the true nature of zuckerberg . his character portrayal is totally wrong -- it is not wrong to have a strong enthusiasm and arrogance behaviour , but it is not right that the movie portrayed him in such a way like everything he did or would do in the future is fueled not purely out of passion , but more like of a vengeful nature . programmers , no matter how arrogant they are , do not behave like that . his face shows anger all the time , even eduardo look more like the geek . these are not just my own opinions . please read the real mark zuckerberg 's own opinions about this movie -- he just summarized all the aforementioned -- and if the original , still living billionaire was that unhappy on a film about him , that 's enough for a low rating from me . and what is with the addition of a break-up with girlfriend -lrb- who is not real -rrb- & that rubbish ending just for the sake of adding some hollywood flavour ? for a script that is adapted from a book ... come on is that all it can do ? david fincher , do you make movies to please yourself , or to stay true to the person who allow you to reveal his story to the world ?		5		0
the musketeer is a curious try to update the classic swashbuckling tale with modern fighting and stunt techniques . i guess it did n't occur to the filmmakers that the modern fighting techniques did n't really exist during the day , but never mind . this film is pretty dull , boring and curiously rushed -lrb- the dialogue is going a mile a second , why were they pushing it so fast ? -rrb- the story is boringly directed by classic hack director hyams , and most of the boredom shows on the actors . catherine deneuve is quite wasted here . i am not too sure what she was doing there in the first place . sorry justin chambers , your 15 minutes are up . the good thing are the stunt sequences , which again , i have to question whether , you know , ladder balancing sword fights actually took place during the day .		5		0
at times an interesting take on zombies , at other times a mess ... this little zombie flick was nonetheless a big hit in europe and spawned three sequels . tombs of the blind dead opens with a group of hooded , blood-drinking knights trying a blonde woman up to a rack , slashing her open with swords and then drinking her blood . a transition brings us to present day when betty -lrb- lone fleming -rrb- meets up with old college roommate virginia -lrb- `` helen harp '' / elena apron -rrb- and her male companion roger -lrb- cesar burner -rrb- at a lisbon pool . the three decide to go camping together and hop a train to take them to their destination . before you know it , assorted jealousies and a lesbian flashback lead virginia to jump off and spend the night alone in an eerie old castle . the `` templar knights '' -lrb- the killer cult shown in the opening sequence , now eyeless and zombified -rrb- emerge from their graves and kill her . when betty , roger and others go to the castle to investigate , they 're faced with a similar fate . the only version i was able to locate was the original us video release -lrb- in 1986 from paragon video -rrb- which is -lrb- surprise ! -rrb- poorly dubbed and seems to have been cut . i 'm not sure if the train finale was intact or not , but it was a real butcher job in the tape i saw and nearly incomprehensible . also , when betty is being raped she cries , screams and puts up a fight , then when it 's all over , she acts as if nothing has happened . despite the myriad problems , it 's worth a single watch for horror fans for the picturesque settings , the crumbling castle backdrops , the atmospheric photography and music and the creepy - looking zombies on horseback . score : 4 out of 10		5		0
this has got to be one of the strangest movies ever made , yet somehow i still find myself revisiting it at least once a year despite the fact that it 's seriously flawed . i will attempt to explain why that is . let 's begin with trying to decipher some sort of `` plot '' out of this mess : from what i can surmise here after multiple viewings , mark preston -lrb- william shatner -rrb- has possession of an important book which has been hidden by the preston family for some 300 years . it contains signatures written in blood of the scores of people who have sold their souls to the devil over the years . there is also an immortal disciple of satan named jonathan corbis -lrb- ernest borgnine -rrb- who has spanned these centuries terrorizing the prestons in a failed attempt to obtain the book , which is required to deliver these souls to lucifer . in the meantime , the tortured victims wait and moan in eternal limbo trapped inside a large vessel called `` the devil 's rain '' until corbis can locate the book he seeks . corbis has succeeded in seizing mark and his mother -lrb- ida lupino -rrb- and turning them into brainwashed cult members , and it 's up to tom preston -lrb- tom skerrit -rrb- and dr. samuel richards -lrb- green acres ' own eddie albert , looking totally lost -rrb- to join forces in foiling corbis ' plan . at least that 's what i think is going on . director robert fuest -lrb- 1970 's wuthering heights , the two dr. phibes films -rrb- does a horrible job in trying to tell a linear story , and there are more holes in the plot here than you would find on 42nd street back in the 1970 's . just about everything going on in this movie may be pointed out as not being adequately explained . and yet -- and yet -- the film is still not without some things to enjoy for fans of cheesy horror ... it 's a treat getting to watch ernest borgnine -lrb- marty himself -rrb- really getting into his diabolical role , and it 's an added kick seeing him in monster makeup whenever he summons up a from the pits of hell , emerging with huge ram horns ! eddie albert seems to be as confused as we are , and this is most obvious in an outside sequence late in the film where he and skerrit are arguing over the meaning of the devil 's rain ; it 's hilarious watching them stepping over each other 's words , and you get the impression they just winged all their dialogue for that scene . william shatner gets his moments to shine where he goes over the top as we 've come to love from him -lrb- `` !!!! goddamn you !!! '' -rrb- . you also got ta love seeing ida lupino sink further in her later years to the point of walking around as a mindless zombie with her eyeballs blackened out , which is the preferred manner of initiation for the souls of satan . and then there is john travolta -- this was his first movie , but it 's nearly impossible to spot him as one of the black-eyed cultists in his few very brief appearances . real-life member of the church of satan , anton lavey , was an `` adviser '' on the film , and appears wearing a mask as one of the devil 's servants . the climax of the movie is worth waiting for , and it was touted highly as the main selling point back in its day ... we get to see the results of the devil 's rain on the minions of cult worshipers when the skies open up and pour down upon them . there are some good effects there , even if it 's obvious how the sequence was being milked for all it 's worth . the devil 's rain is not a good movie , but all the same it 's one of those weird horror pictures that may appeal to fans of `` so bad they 're good '' flicks .		5		0
`` alexander '' is a handsome but clunky attempt to duplicate those sword-and-sandal epics of the past . although the screenplay gets many of the details of alexander 's biography right , the movie fails to being the character himself to life , thanks , primarily , to flat writing and a wooden performance by colin farrell , who turns the 4th century b.c. macedonian leader - who pretty much single-handedly changed the course of western civilization - into little more than a whiny , teary-eyed mama 's boy -lrb- and the actor they 've chosen to portray alex at 11 looks so much like little mark lester in `` oliver '' that i half expected him to break out into a chorus of `` where is love ? '' before his part was over -rrb- . none of the other characters make much of an impact either , although angelina jolie , as olympias , his scheming , diabolical mother , turns in a scenery-chewing performance that is at least fun to watch . anthony hopkins brings his trademark pomposity to the role of ptolemy , historian and narrator of the tale , lending an air of urbane pretentiousness to the film . almost the only thing of interest in the film is the surprisingly forthright way in which stone deals with alexander 's homosexuality , as reflected in his lifelong devotion to the pal of his youth , hephaistion . many filmmakers , aiming for the kind of mainstream audience a film of this budget and size demands , would have simply sidestepped the issue . it 's true that the one full-on sex scene is between alexander and his persian wife , but stone at least leaves us with little doubt as to where alexander 's true inclinations lie . for the most part , though , this is a surprisingly conventional and even conservative film for director stone . missing are the human insights and fancy directorial flourishes we 've come to expect from the maker of `` platoon , '' `` born on the fourth of july , '' `` nixon , '' and `` jfk '' -lrb- although the unsubstantiated conspiratorial ending reminds one of `` jfk '' -rrb- . the dialogue is generally pedestrian and prosaic , and the story dawdles when it most needs to move on . the battle scenes are fairly scanty and redundant , although the sight of a herd of elephants charging through the forest as part of an indian army is mighty impressive . at just a hair shy of three hours , the director 's edition of `` alexander '' is a mighty long haul indeed .		5		0
repo man is a fun sci-fi flick about an l.a. punk -lrb- emilio estevez -rrb- who gets pulled into the world of car , with the main target being a strange '64 chevy malibu with aliens in the trunk . for a movie with cheap looking effects , this one stands out as an entertaining portrayal of an urban punk trying to be himself and not trying to fit in with the other punks , though some of the other actors barely make an impression and some performances are a little below par , but that 's beside the fact that this is a movie worth watching . 3 out of 5		5		0
trying to find any logical , common sense in this propaganda film is like trying to find some actual `` words '' in george w. bush 's speeches . the film focuses on how teens who are clean cut become insane , killing freaks when taking just one puff of marijuana . i actually do recommend this movie - to potheads , and perhaps some that are not . so that they , like i , can laugh they 're heads off at the idiotic and unsound attempts to try and thwart off teens from smoking pot . kids -lrb- i mean like 8 and 9 year olds -rrb- should not watch this movie not because they might be scared from smoking pot -lrb- perhaps for all the silly reasons -rrb- , but because whenever they see someone smoke it they will -lrb- knowing kids -rrb- think that person is freddy kruger . if people are serious about censoring content in movies , it should be in this one . still , the film is hilariously stupid , and as long as you do n't take it in the very smallest amount of seriousness , it will be some fun . and roemheld 's music is also amusing to the film . 2010 : as an amendment to this , i should also note how the film rises to a whole other level if this is watched with rifftrax -lrb- the mst3k guys -rrb- , who have recorded a new commentary track with the movie , and no less ! you 'll never look at crazed pot smokers and their ilk ever again . certainly not the lame nerdy character talking to the camera .		5		0
no doubt director bob marshall does bob fosse proud ; but i guess i was expecting more . catherine zeta-jones plays velma kelley , a popular chicago nightclub star who gains more fame than she needs after shooting her cheating husband . velma 's notoriety soon begins to fade when an aspiring stage performer , roxie hart -lrb- renee zellweger -rrb- , who also shoots her lover and winds up in jail . under the self-serving guidance of prison supervisor mama morton -lrb- queen latifah -rrb- and silver-tongued lawyer billy flynn -lrb- richard gere -rrb- , the two divas conjure freedom , with each trying to steal the favor of the spotlight from the other . zeta-jones is no less a goddess . zellweger has the way to charm your attention . queen latifah if nothing else provides cleavage . and the ever charming gere fights off being pedestrian . albeit it only took close to three decades to get fosse 's broadway musical glittering on the silver screen .		5		0
no one probably working today can imbue the image of a bride pissing in the middle of a golf course with the afterglow of existential soul-searching like trier does here - well , there was peter greenaway at one point but i have n't kept track . side by side the romantic , the visceral , the transcendent , each one perversely subverting the others . but , having searched and yearned , eventually with trier we arrive at nothing . nothing in the predominantly western , worldview that has pushed god to the side and seated the mind in his place . nothing is too much for trier then , because nothing satisfies the mind ; everything that is touched by humanity is shown to be randomly bubbling up from some cold , infertile void . but this is the thing with trier , why it 's so troubling to dismiss him ; even though he makes art about a meaningless world - and so why pay attention ? - he remains a powerful poet of cinema . so he is an , which perhaps explains why he opens the film with the hunters in the snow - a painting used in solyaris - burning , and why horses are forced to kneel in the face of petulant violence . whereas tarkovsky understood the universe to be centered inside , and used that to sculpt space and metaphor from that center , trier is grounded nowhere ; so he resolves to orbit from one periphery to the next , nicely framing for us anxieties that we can relate to but with no deeper insight of their mechanism . but now and then he works from a powerful set of ideas . here it is the mirrored metaphor ; the pain and suffering of life on earth as mirrored on the cosmic level , and our hope that this suffering looming above will just pass us by . it is not sci-fi in any way you may recognize , or anymore than tree of life is . it does not work like that , of course , that is a given . so we are placed in the shoes of the woman - the bride in her wedding reception , where life is ritually supposed to become orderly , assuring , meaningful - and forced to make our way for the occasion wearing a forced smile , and hoping the pain will just pass us by . yes , it does not work like that . the mother is haughty and domineering , the father sloppy and indiscreet . everyone else is busy performing their roles , going through motions , speeches , confrontations which are often funny but always grueling to see . so , with the soul unsupervised , the perfect occasion for happiness inexplicably crumbles from inside . the second part is about the sister , who already has the perfectly happy life or is supposed to . but again , of course , it does n't work . suffering , uncertainty hangs above that we ca n't simply brush off . so it is the dawning of acceptance that governs this part of the film ; but , properly at least for trier and in a way that should make sense , we 're shown the impossibility of that acceptance . faces are increasingly bewildered , affections grow distant , motions agitated . a lot of my distaste for what trier does , is exemplified in a scene where the depressed sister confronts the other ; instead of reciprocating the nurture and support , however obligatory it may have seemed at the time , she preys on her weakness . why drink wine in the veranda and pretend none of this is going to happen ? why not ? but the acceptance is handled with so much nihilism , a sort of comfortable noncommittal , that i want to take a step back . no equanimity flows from trier 's emptiness , and so the vision is useless for me . i want films embedded in a world that matters in some way . yes , we 're all going to face an inscrutable fate , but it 's one thing to frame this with compassion , another thing altogether to frame with contempt or cold satisfaction . so it is apt to compare with tree of life on more than just the cosmic level of wheels whirring life into pattern ; there is the sense of emptying out , the search for a true face that restores meaning . malick goes the extra mile though , he reconciles into the impermanence of all things and from there a deep , loving humanity . trier is simply left aghast at it . sex is a vice and the mind is unable to cope ; so he merely casts the characters away at the precipice . but not before ironically rendering human faith as a magical cave made from fire sticks . oh , he captures the drab , grueling of depression well , no wonder as he knows from personal experience . and a google search seems to yield a nod at filmmaker lav diaz , that was pretty unexpected . there are pleasures though that you should see ; planets caressing each other like faces below , a bird 's eye view of horses galloping . some of it borders on kitsch when kirsten dunst is photographed naked beneath the , the schadenfreude is so earnestly conceived . and there is the parting image ; i do n't know how much of it was the theater , technology , but it swell up into the most deafening , soul-crushing crescendo . i could feel particles being dislocated inside of me . but considering what comes before , it 's not something i wanted to swim into but let wash . it 's fitting for trier though , the wagnerian sound of the void washing life empty . it is a powerful work , do n't just take it lightly . but i urge you to meditate against it . oh yes , it is all going to end sooner or later . but , as a principle , i urge you to never settle for a destructive void in your life : in the midst of blistering destruction , try to see around you what the eastern mystics knew as the universe of 10,000 beautiful things trampled by god shiva in his final dance . let yourself be filled with a profound sadness that is joy for the 10,000 beautiful things around you .		5		0
i could have sworn i already wrote a review for `` hook , '' but glancing at my review archive just now , i realized i had n't - what a shock ! i 've seen it so many times over the years ... and each time it grows worse and worse . -lrb- but in a good way , if that makes any sense . -rrb- `` hook '' is a terrible film , yes . but in some ways , it 's also very good . the ideas that surface are unique - what if peter pan grew up ? what if he forgot who he was ? what if , what if , what if ... ? the movie 's stumbling block is spielberg . this represents his best and worst - it 's imaginative -lrb- the good -rrb- but way too bright , over-the-top and exuberant -lrb- the bad -rrb- . spielberg 's liberal impact on the material is always present - he represents the lost boys as a pack of minority kids , who ride skateboards and look like they just stepped out of stereotypical ghetto number one . the movie 's flashy coloring and vibrant overtones bring to mind his older failures such as `` 1941 '' - similarly `` hook '' is a film that , despite its faults , remains somewhat interesting . the second huge slip-up is casting julia roberts as tinkerbell . meg ryan was originally considered for the role and she would have been about a million times better . roberts is annoying and gives one of the worst performances of her career -lrb- which is saying quite a lot -rrb- ; ryan 's acting skills are n't too great either -lrb- take a look at `` the doors '' -rrb- but when she sticks to the right roles she 's always great . this would have been one of her perfect roles . i could sit here and criticize this film to all ends but at the end of the day i always find just as much to like . robin williams is suitable as peter and dustin hoffman absolutely steals the show as hook - he delivers the best screen persona of hook to ever reach the big screen , far surpassing jason isaacs in the 2003 j.m. barrie version in particular . -lrb- i think isaacs is a great villain in cinema and he was given such little to do as hook . -rrb- the co-stars are all talented - british veterans like maggie smith add class - and the film 's on-location shooting in london gives it an authentic feel . overall i 'm giving it a five-star -lrb- out of ten -rrb- rating because i do n't really `` like '' the movie . but when it 's on , i usually watch it . i used to own the vhs tape . i think some of the ideas are really clever and the performances are great . it 's a shame about spielberg and his wacky taste for the absurd , but at the end of the day , that 's what has helped `` hook '' retain its status as a beloved failure over the years - this is the movie everyone loves to hate .		5		0
ok , this movie has some beautiful scenes -lrb- that 's why i give it a 5 -rrb- , but overall it 's too long -lrb- 3 hours , 15 minutes ! -rrb- , incorrectly letterboxed -lrb- it shows -rrb- , color is faded and it 's just plain boring after a while . director george stevens shows reverence to the subject -- too much . also he was given full creative control -- a bad mistake . the movie just rambles on endlessly after a while with a few truly beautiful scenes to break the . the acting is -- , it varies . max von sydow -lrb- as jesus -rrb- is way too serious . he 's always frowning -- never changes emotion once . the other acting ranges from very good -lrb- claude rains , david mccallum , dorothy mcguire -rrb- to -lrb- telly savalas , donald pleasance , sal mineo and -- worst of all -- john wayne -rrb- ? it turns into after a while . so , it 's well made but too long and boring . too bad , there 's some beautiful sequences here .		5		0
`` crash '' remains cronenberg 's most controversial movies . permeating with sex and obscenity , coupled with obsessions of both bodily and mechanical nature , it was born on shock factor . film producer james ballard -lrb- james spader -rrb- and his promiscuous wife catherine -lrb- the voluptuous deborah kara unger -rrb- lead a life of mutually accepted sexual ventures , searching for ultimate satisfaction by indulging into various affairs . a car accident featuring helen remington -lrb- holly hunter -rrb- introduces another level of compulsive sexual mania - where sexual desires and metal mesh together to form a hybrid of death , car crashes and orgiastic pleasure . this introduces both james and catherine to the vaughan -lrb- elias koteas -rrb- and their common spiralling search for fulfilment , where boundaries are pushed further and further , while sperm leaks by the gallons ... a story less about the addiction to sex or dangerous driving , but more about the growing infatuation with the mechanical , as it slowly overrides bodily desires to entail fulfilment . as a car becomes a subject of desire , craving and our bodies seem to merge with its leather seats and metallic odour , cronenberg shows a new phase of humanity . one devoid of emotion , cold and ever expanding , as desire becomes limitless to the death . taking the issue of automotive obsession to the extreme `` crash '' manages to pack an uneasy wallop , one however that is overlong and for half its running time directionless . once the premise is clear characters indulge into sexual deviance to sexual deviance with each passing scene pushing themselves further , when the previously passed boundary no longer satisfies the growing need . although the gist is evident the tirade of weird sex and masturbation becomes tiring and fails to add any further layers to the story . it is hard to blame cronenberg , as the execution fits the story . bleak , detached from emotion , jaded and monotonous fulfils the goal of presenting the lingering disconnect of characters , which are so lost in lack of feeling , whilst trying to discover fulfilment . especially apparent when ballard and catherine have sex - physical pleasure is achieved , but emotional fulfilment is . therefore the search for emotion -lrb- one induced by the adrenaline rush of a crash -rrb- triggers a longing for more of this natural drug , but at the same time increasing the level required for satisfaction . this self-destructive behaviour is so natural , so human , but achieved through such dehumanised means ... a tough piece of fiction , which is hard fought to be called pleasant , but definitely a shocking piece worthy of reflection and afterthought , not necessarily admiration .		5		0
when i was a kid i had a friend whose sister , roughly a generation our senior , was an avid collector of film magazines and annuals . this was in the uk so i 'm referring to essentially ` fan ' magazines such as picture show , , f. maurice speed 's film review , etc. . i beguiled many a rainy hour leafing through this ephemera and a ` still ' , from a film i 'd never heard of , angel on my shoulder , stayed in my mind . is showed claude rains and paul muni emerging from the ground with some bizarre metal arc over their heads . that was the last i heard of angel on my shoulder from that day to this , when it was screened on bbc2 at a.m. . this i had to see , still knowing nothing about it , and so i got up early . i stood in bed , as they say in new york . in the few films in which i 've seen him i 've always found paul muni so mannered as to make emil jannings look laid-back and this was no exception . in the early scenes especially he looked for all the world like someone in a silent film being directed to express ` terror ' or ` zombie ' , it was hard to decide . as for hell itself it resembled nothing so much as a german ` expressionist ' version of gene o'neill 's the hairy ape . claude rains was his usual suave self but forget any chemistry between him and muni and forget even more strongly any chemistry between muni and his ` love interest ' anne baxter . a couple of days before i 'd seen baxter attempting to scare up some chemistry with monty clift in i confess , so it seemed she was , for a time , lumbered with leading men off whom she was unable to strike sparks . it was definitely worth seeing , especially after waiting a lifetime on the strength of one ` still ' , but once is definitely enough .		5		0
the story of amelie will either grab you or it wo n't . certainly this is one of the greatest looking films , with a witty frantic style that is a pleasure to look at simply because there is so much to look at . those wanting to study how to make a film from a visual stand point should put this on the list of films to study . the story is a mixed bag . i know many people who have watched this film and fell in love with its quirky romance and view of life . i on the other hand was pained from the get go , finding its attempts at humor severely lacking in everything even in the ability to even make me crack a smile . to me it wants to be applauded for being off center instead of being good . try it , you may like it , or you maybe like me and wonder what all the shouting is about .		5		0
it 's always the same with robert rodriguez 's movies : for a while , the pulp hokum is quite a fun to watch , but from the midway mark on the superficial in-your-face shenanigans grow tiresome and repetitive . this over-the-top actioner - full of bloodletting and sexploitation - is n't his worst pic , though . if you enjoy violent mayhem , cheesy one-liners and -lrb- un -rrb- intentional bad acting from an illustrious cast , this is solid entertainment for about an hour , but as the situations lose momentum and their tongue-in-cheek attitude and since one 's interest in cardboard figures is slight , anyway , the final reels , featuring a yawn-inducing showdown , prove to be too much of a good -lrb- or rather bad -rrb- thing . 5 out of 10 handy intestines		5		0
i went into this film thinking i was going to see a cool action flick with kurt russell . i finished knowing i had just seen a bad action flick with kurt russell in it . the movie is definitely big budget and has hollywood written all over it . that , however , is n't my complaint . my complaint is that the film never has anything in it to care about . it 's in some serious need of character development . the beginning of the film has promise in showing how these soldiers are raised from birth to be next to perfect . they could have just stuck with this idea and made a great movie . instead they introduce a bad guy , not very convincingly played by jason scott lee , and make it a very hokey action picture with big set pieces . as a matter of fact , why is lee even in this movie ? lee 's character has two good fight sequences and he is gone . that does n't make any sense . kurt russell gives a good performance as a stiff , almost robot-like soldier , but the story is n't any good . avoid this one .		5		0
this movie has elements of other horror movies because at times it resembles your typical slasher movie , at other times something supernatural seems to be afoot , and still at other times it is like a mystery . for the most part though it is highly forgettable , with the exception of the dream sequences and the end which for a movie i rank as rather weak is as good as it gets in the horror genre . of course , what makes the ending so good is that it sort of comes out of nowhere yet it does not . there are things that are said and things that happen that let one know what has happened , the person is basically warned , but it is still nice and creepy when it does occur . the rest of the movie is more the typical slasher , someone is killing the local amish like clan and others . this clan starts by trying to get rid of three gals who move into a farm house , most notably a young sharon stone . some gore here and there , the deaths are not to gruesome though which for me is a shame , however there is a scene involving a spider that is rather good , for me i say add more supernatural elements to the film , but then if they did that the ending would have been less of a surprise i guess .		5		0
the idea of fictional characters coming to life and starting to interact with people in the real world is a common one in fantasy literature , going back at least to pirandello 's `` six characters in search of an author '' perhaps the best-known cinematic expression of this concept is woody allen 's `` the purple rose of cairo '' in which a character in a 1930s romantic comedy suddenly steps down from the cinema screen and begins addressing the heroine . `` ruby sparks '' is a recent version of the same idea . calvin weir-fields is a young novelist who achieved immense success with his first novel , written while he was still a teenager . ten years on , however , he is struggling with writer 's block and in desperation turns for help to a psychotherapist . eventually , calvin imagines a young woman named ruby sparks and begins to write about her . to his astonishment , ruby suddenly appears in his life as an actual living person . the film then explores all the complications which arise from this development , including calvin 's discovery that he can influence ruby 's behaviour by writing about her . the film was written by zoe kazan , who also plays ruby ; calvin is played by kazan 's real-life boyfriend paul dano . the problem with the film is that it is just too derivative . not only is the basic concept lifted from a woody allen film , the character of calvin - a neurotic , angst-ridden , intellectual - comes across as a poor man 's woody allen , the sort of character woody has played in numerous movies going back at least to the time of `` bananas '' and `` sleeper '' . dano 's voice even sounds like the young woody . calvin is so self-doubting that i could never really accept him as a successful novelist - and what successful novelist in 2012 uses a manual typewriter rather than a computer ? it might have been better if kazan had written the character as a struggling , unsuccessful writer who has never had a book published . dano was excellent in the only other film i have seen him in , `` there will be blood '' , but here his performance came as a disappointment . kazan 's performance as ruby is rather better , but i felt that the lady did protest too much when she specifically stated that ruby was not a manic pixie dream girl , because to my mind that was exactly what she was . that , after all , is a term which has recently come into use for a certain type of stock character in films , normally romantic comedies . the term is generally used to describe a bubbly , quirky , eccentric female character who seems to lack any inner life of her own and who exists solely to help her brooding or depressed boyfriend come to terms with life or to teach him important lessons about life , and that description seems to fit ruby down to a `` t '' . she is a dream girl in the most literal sense of that term - she first appears to calvin in one of his dreams - and lacks all sense of an inner life because she is only a figment of his imagination . it is perhaps appropriate that calvin creates ruby after his therapist gives him a writing assignment , because the script for `` ruby sparks '' has the air of something written for an assignment as part of a school or college creative writing class . if it had been written under those circumstances it would probably have been quite well received , getting a b or b + from the tutor , but it never really struck me as the sort of thing which would normally serve as the basis of a full-length feature film . 5/10		5		0
american beauty : dramedy about a man living through a mid-life crisis , whose infatuation with a teenage girl serves him as a wake up call to do something about his comfortable , but less than perfect life . after reading other imdb user reviews , it was not surprising to find people already predicting award for this film months away even for nominations . do n't get me wrong : i loved american beauty . but why the same type of award talk do n't go to films like the matrix or the 6th sense ? simple : the academy awards gives priority to genres like period pieces , family dramas , and in another time , musicals , while ignoring genres like horror , action , science fiction and mystery , no matter how well crafted these films could be . other than the french connection and silence of the lambs , i do n't remember oscar leaving this pattern . american beauty however , gets bold with scenes of masturbation , child corruption , drug use , adultery , child abuse and murder . i have no problem with this when the scenes are done as tastefully as in this film . my problem comes when a jewel like kids gets grilled for its almost equal bold contempt , while beauty is praised . let 's wake up and smell the roses audience .		5		0

for the 1st hour , you will have no idea what is going on . it will then appear that will smith is doing an imitation of touched by an angel . he suddenly is a do-good person , helping out people in all sorts of situations . go know that his reckless driving had caused the death of 7 people and that he is trying to make amends for what happened . the first hour of this film needed to tie up some sort of connection . these first 60 minutes seems like it 's forever as we see smith give a pretty convincing performance . the film says something about donating body parts . just do n't do it in the manner that smith did .		5		0

i do n't always find woody allen funny or stimulating , but i do think he 's very smooth and efficient as a filmmaker , and that 's why the stumbling `` alice '' surprised me . it has bits and pieces of clever comedy and fantasy , but it 's saddled with a script that seems made up of parts from different movies . mia farrow is charming -lrb- as usual -rrb- playing a new york city wife and mother whose visit to a chinese herb doctor sets her on a journey of self-discovery . ok , so far , so good . but i found nothing of interest in her sour marriage to william hurt -lrb- their scenes are poor from all standpoints -rrb- and nothing good can be said for alec baldwin as a ghost . keye luke is perfectly cast as the unconventional medico who helps alice change her outlook on life , and the film picks up a bit at the 60 minute mark with other nice turns by bernadette peters and blythe danner . but when woody allen veers back to the marriage stuff , his narrative becomes unhappily inconclusive . `` alice '' plays very flat on television ; perhaps in the theater -- with an appreciative audience -- it was somewhat more bearable . ** from ****		5		0
` faster ' , directed by george tillman , jr , is a routine vendetta fare , that has the rock at his best . but , the writing ai n't good enough here . the rock stars as an ex-con , who sets out to avenge his brother 's death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago . he butchers each villain , but during his mission , he is faced by a hit-man and a veteran cop . ` faster ' begins well , but the screenplay drags itself a bit more than it should have . for example , the entire chapter featuring the hit-man looks forced and bores in the goings-on . one wonders was this character even needed ? even that climax for the matter , is full of loopholes . writers tony gayton and joe gayton , have n't done a swell job , while director george tillman , jr , has done his job right . the rock is the life of ` faster ' . the legendary wrestler , looks each bit of the character , and delivers a performance that can truly be credited as ` memorable ' . i 've always been a fan of his , and he never disappoints me . he rocks ! among other performances , billy bob thornton is average , while carla gugino is effective . on the whole , ` faster ' is a must watch only for those who love the rock .		5		0
-lrb- some spoilers -rrb- early in the movie `` the glass house '' at their parents funeral we see uncle jack , chris north , tell the two bereaved children ruby & rhett baker , leelee & trevor morgan , of his late sister grace baker , rita wislon , how sorry he was for not seeing or talking to them in over ten years and that anytime they need his help just to just pick up the phone and call . with everything that ruby and rhett went through they never bothered to call uncle jack for help ! the next and last time we see uncle jack is at the end of the movie at the graveyard like we were first introduced to him ; this shows just how disjointed the movie is . with their parents gone ruby & rhett are given , by the courts , into custody of the glass ' terry & erin , stellan skarsgard & diane lane . at first life could never be better for the kids but then strange things start to happen that made them at first feel uncomfortable and then terrorized by the couple . the nightly fights and the shooting up by erin where she 's left in a comatose state as well as terry 's involvement with the mob , he borrowed one million dollars from it , has put their lives in danger and they , or at least ruby , want to leave the `` glass house '' as fast as possible but where could they go and who could they trust ? the baker 's estate lawyer mr. , bruce dern , who according to the baker 's wishes had the glass ' take over the parenting of their underage children but he seems to also be involved in this scheme for the glass ' to defraud both ruby & rhett of the four million dollar inheritance that were left to them . what mr. does n't know is how much trouble his partner in crime , terry glass , is in with the mob wanting their cash that they loaned him , with interest , and how he 's in the same situation that terry is in by being his , unknowing , silent partner in the business that he has with the mobsters . `` the glass house '' would be a so/so made for tv movie if it were n't for the breathtaking photography of the california pacific coast highway and the beautiful malibu coastline , there 's also the stunning 18 year-old leelee to gaze at , leelee 's midnight dip in the glass ' indoor swimming pool was by far the best scene in the movie . the story never really made that much sense in the fact why the two kids were so helpless in getting help since there were the police the school the social workers and last but not least the very willing and able uncle jack to turn to . with erin glass dead of a drug overdose and terry dead drunk from guzzling down a fifth of vodka mr. come over to house to see him about the money that he ca n't seem to get his hands on from the baker children thrust . it then becomes obvious that they , the glass ' & , had something to do with the baker 's death . just then the two mob collectors don & whitey , & gavin o'connor , drop over to get the cash that terry owes their boss which he of course he does n't have and you can just guess what happens after that .		5		0
you know how , when you 're a kid , you want to ride a bike but two wheels on a full scale bike is too difficult because you fall off , so they bolt on two extra wheels to your back wheel so that you ca n't fall over ? training wheels ? well , someone had the bright idea that if you go from ordinary movies to full scale horror movies you might fall off , so it 's a good idea to make a movie which is the equivalent of a bike with training wheels - all the things which go into horror movies are there , but in junior , non-scary versions . so , when someone gets stabbed - which happens fairly often - there 's no blood or stab wounds . and there are lots of scary moments - but they are n't actually scary . this is a slasher movie for people who need it spelled sl * sh * r because they ca n't cope with the full spelling . above everything , this movie is a movie of disappointments . you have a moment where boyfriend and girlfriend have an argument . he goes looking for her , not knowing she has been killed . does he find her , giving us a moment which may have some emotional resonance ? no , he gets killed too , without ever finding her . this movie is glossy , and the young people in it are attractive and try hard . but it is disappointing .		5		0
after the defeat of nazism and the revelation of its horrors , people in the allied nations were suddenly compelled to talk about that racial prejudice that existed in their own backyards . it 's an indicator of how fiercely the issue was beginning to burn , that even cautiously commercial hollywood was in on the act , making a high-class production of gentleman 's agreement . but unlike most of the movies on racism that were to follow in later years , gentleman 's agreement is not about persecution of black people , but about anti-semitism . this is not to downplay anti-semitism , but given the relative scale of the problem in the usa it does seem as if hollywood is just taking baby steps in the field of race relations . especially since the movie specifically defines jewishness as a matter of faith , not ethnicity . what 's more , gentleman 's agreement only really attacks prejudice as it exists in upper-class society -- being refused entry to a club or having people turn their noses up at a dinner party -- a long way from the hatred and violence that makes up the thin end of bigotry 's wedge . given that it now seems such a weedy condemnation of prejudice , perhaps better to view it simply as a drama . after all , director elia kazan is ace at dramas . kazan 's style is marked by the confidence to keep his subjects further back within the shot . there 's a bit where celeste holm calls gregory peck from within her office , and their conversation follows with no change of angle , no cut to a close-up of holm . while there never are any actual close-ups , the layering within the frame can produce an intense feeling of closeness at times . when peck and dorothy mcguire have an argument after he is refused a room at the hotel , they move from being near a set of double doors at the back of the room , then they move to the foreground , and the sudden gulf between them and the doors in the background make it feel like they have suddenly stepped into our personal space . and then of course we have a cast of top dramatic actors . sadly lead man peck 's performance is rather a corny one . watching his deliberation as he comes to the decision to pose as jewish is almost painful . he 's only good when he 's being stern and forceful , and it 's later in the movie he starts to come into his own . the great performances in gentleman 's agreement belong to its women . dorothy mcguire is nicely understated , her voice near to a husky whisper as she delivers her most pertinent lines . celeste holm is excellent , for most of the movie a joyful and easygoing presence , so carefree and likable that her steely outburst towards the end seems all the more stark and powerful . anne revere , always a monument of dignity even in the grip of an attack , proving herself one of the most effortlessly natural actresses of her generation . in her smaller role , june havoc is very good too . unfortunately , if we 're going to take gentleman 's agreement as a drama , it starts to look a very flimsy movie indeed . the romantic angle is as bland as day-old kebab meat , and the dialogue is corny and dull . it 's a shame then that this was the first movie condemning racial prejudice to receive major plaudits , not because the social evils it portrays were n't worth attacking , but that there were other movies doing it far better . in the same year crossfire also looked at anti-semitism in a much more dynamic story framework , and with deeper eloquence and insight , but it was a runner up to gentleman 's agreement 's best picture win . a few years later pinky -lrb- also directed by kazan -rrb- and no way out would address anti-black racism , but while pinky would receive a fair bit of attention , the ahead-of-its-time no way out was practically relegated to b-movie status . it 's in a way remarkable that these other pictures existed at all , but a pity they did n't get the credit they deserved .		5		0
the story of a cultural revolution from is portrayed in an excellent , intelligent fashion . the arts , both visual and theatrical are studied as the united states attempts to weed out communism . unions are everywhere too . the movie is smartly done , and a good piece of historical reference too -lrb- sort of -rrb- . how many people under 25 would actually care about watching this kind of movie though ? the movie is strictly for movie buffs . heck , this could have easily gotten away as a broadway production rather than a movie . for someone wanting a quick movie , this is not it !		5		0
the closing credits of this film would suggest it is a true story . i 'm very sceptical of that , but if so it 's worrying to say the least ! jackson plays a lunatic man who is obsessed by comic books and has had a whole life of injuries and illness , the direct opposite to willis ' seemingly unbreakable life . i did n't really enjoy this to be honest , and it was nowhere near as good as the combination of the two in the die hard series .		5		0
how would the world become without any people ? this could be possible only in one condition that is there is no birth and race of people story is awful as the most `` hate it '' commentors 5 or more points for this film is a great unjustice to godfather , fargo etc. . . wherever you look at it the story is full of want my two hour back , too . i think the director includes michael caine to prevent that spectators should comment badly . i ca n't find any reasonable explanation . children of men : i suggest you should n't watch , loss of time , nonsense . anyway , you thing i know about that is this film certainly does n't deserve to be placed in top 250 .		5		0
i have not written a comment in about 12 days because the internet on my computer was broken and in the time when it was broken i watched like 10 really great movies that i was going to comment on but i could not comment on them and now its been to long for me to rite a good comment . i watched this movie at the cinema yesterday with my good friend jacob and i have never seen a episode of the dukes of hazzard tv series and i would love to watch have been saying that this movie is really crap but it is not really that bad and i give it 5 and a half out of 10 . johnny knoxville from the movie jackass and the funny man seann william scott both do a good job at acting in this movie and jessica simpson is so so so sexy in this movie . over all this movie was good and my rating is 5 and a half out of 10 .		5		0
the dark is directed by john fawcett and adapted to screenplay by stephen from the novel `` sheep '' written by simon maginn . it stars sean bean , maria bello , richard , maurice roëves , abigail stone , sophie and caspar harvey . music is scored by edmund butt and cinematography is by christian sebaldt . an american mother tries to bring her family back together by taking her daughter to visit her estranged husband on the coast of wales . however , when their daughter vanishes into the sea , the parents find all maybe not as it at first seems , especially when a similar looking girl appears on the scene . if you saw the tag line before watching the movie , as i did , you will know exactly what is going to happen in the dark . casting that irritant aside , though , the dark is a frustratingly disappointing film . there was so much promise with the core premise of family detachment meeting the welsh mythological world of annwn , it 's a beautifully photographed picture as well , but fawcett -lrb- ginger snaps -rrb- and -lrb- ginger snaps back -rrb- bite off more than they can chew . choosing to forgo the chance to craft a rural world of mythological pagan like horror -lrb- hello wicker man et al -rrb- , the makers instead go for a dizzying collage of plot threads leading to a otherworld that 's quite frankly not at all scary or atmospherically threatening . the attempt at scares are lazy and feel like they were inserted in at a later date to try and beef up the horror factor . bean is underused and bello never fully convinces as the mother awash with guilt ; though to be fair to the actress she 's not helped by the writing which is n't sure which side of the fence they want the audience to sit with her . then to cap it all off we get a weak finale which is even more tepid if you have been unfortunate enough to have seen that damn tag line ! missed opportunities all round , a film with ideas above its station in spite of great work from photographer and music man . 5/10		5		0
` holiday inn ' is not really a christmas film , but it is a film about all holidays and the film that made ` white christmas ' a best-selling and popular song . this film is about a couple of partners who fight over the girls in their lives . bing crosby 's character decides to move out of new york city to a farm , and he turns this into an inn where they sing songs and dance on every holiday in the year , from christmas to president 's day to valentine 's day . it 's a musical with plenty of song and dance with bing crosby and fred astaire , and it has a little bit of a love story in it too . the highlight of this film is , of course , when bing crosby and the female lead sing ` white christmas ' in front of the piano and when the female lead then sings it herself at the end of the film , remembering these memories . this scene is done particularly well , but if you like musicals , then do n't overlook this one . there is plenty of singing and dancing and a pretty good storyline to keep you interested . and , you must see the scenes where ` white christmas ' is sung .		5		0
i found the story in death wish 2 to simular to the original . maybe , if i saw 2 first i would give it a higher rating . this film is brutal , but crime is brutal ; i think the director did this , as in the original , not as a selling point but too show the brutality of crime on the victim , and the remorselessness of the criminal . this make me understand why walsh does america most wanted . criminals , the dogs they are , do these things , and gives the more protected liberal minded person and idea of the kinds of animals the police deal with . this movie is not for kids ! should something this honest be made ? i do not know the answer . this part of the movie show why bronson snaps . the only difference in this film from the original is this time bronson gets a look at the , anus , criminals and hunts them down . one other viewer thinks the bad guys act too strange , normal people do not do these things , but crazy people act crazy . what hurts this film , besides the script , is the editing and music . i like the 80 's la feel , but the film is choppy or rushed . the directing is good , but who ever edited this ouch . 5/10		5		0
steve zahn is a funny guy . amanda peet is a sexy girl . and the film has energy in spades . what it lacks is wit : the humor is mostly moronic and obviously aimed at the less discriminating audiences . despite an element of misogyny , however , the film is n't as annoying as peet 's previous `` vehicle '' , `` whipped '' . -lrb- ** -rrb-		5		0
paul bettany stars as the angel michael who comes to earth to stand against the angelic order who has been sent to earth to wipe out mankind and stop the birth of a new messiah . a late night dash to the theater was rewarded with a rather run of the mill film . the plot and such is the sort of thing that has been done before any number of times before . its not bad , its just the sort of thing that made me wonder what in the hell i was doing sitting in a theater at at night when i could be home asleep . we 'll not get into the logic holes since the sense of deja vu was so over powering it took away any real suspense . the cast which includes dennis quaid and charles dutton is quite good and no doubt helped it get a theatrical release . you 've seen this before so just wait for cable .		5		0
killer shrews ! mad scientists ! lover 's quarrels ! all this and more ! i just knew that i have seen james best somewhere before . he has been in 177 films and tv shows , but did n't remember because i have only watched `` the dukes of hazzard '' once or twice . he 's sheriff rosco p. coltrane ! you just ca n't hide that face . here he is a simple boat captain delivering supplies to an island with crazy scientists doing genetic experiments . they created some killer shrews that looked just ghastly . the teeth were four or five inches long ! worse than that , they used some poison that did n't kill them , but will certainly kill you with just a scratch . a horrid night with the shrews attacking and the captain trying to save sultry blonde ingrid goude , not only from the shrews , but from ken curtis -lrb- festus haggen from `` gunsmoke '' -rrb- who wanted her for his own . innovative escape and lots of rabid shrew action .		5		0
like death and taxes , nothing in this world is certain anymore except that if a movie in the past made more than its cost , it will be remade . somebody once remarked that as far as movies were concerned , the united states consisted of three part : new york city , the south , and the rest of the country . sam pekinpah 's original was set in cornwall or some godforsaken place and pitted no-goodniks against a weak mathematician and his sluttish wife . the remake moves the story to where it always belong , in the rural south . english farm boys are just no substitute for the ranting james woods and his gang of sullen , smirking redneck hoods . the husband , james marsden , is no longer a mathematician . there 's no particular reason why he 's become a novelist or playwright here . maybe the screenwriters thought that mathematics was the sort of enterprise that was too difficult for the audience , who might turn away in disgust . aside from that , dustin hoffman was better casting than marsden . hoffman had virtually no shoulders and is short , whereas marsden has the fully developed figure of an adult male . but he does n't compare to the chief villain , alexander skarsgard , who is taller than anyone else and who , in his many shirtless scenes , we notice has been working out to the extent that his muscles have muscles . nobody in the original was a behemoth . yet , there is more ambiguity in this film , at least as far as skarsgard 's heavy is concerned . he 's an ex boyfriend of marsden 's provocative wife , kate bosworth . at the climactic orgasm of violence , he seems genuinely intent on protecting her from the other drunken louts . this has n't stopped him from raping her and allowing one of his buddies to sodomize her earlier . it 's not a terrible movie , not for a remake . but , as is the case with almost all remakes , the original has been taken and shot full of . everything is faster and louder . and if pekinpah used some very short flashbacks , the director here uses dozens of them , instantaneous . some of the second-long inserts are pointless . the camera wobbles as if being held by a man having a stroke in his . that 's pandering to today 's impatient adolescent audiences who want more blood , sex , and mayhem . i 'm subtracting a point or two from the rating because of its message -- kill 'em all and let god sort 'em out -- and the means of its conveyance .		5		0
alien vs. predator : 5/10 : aliens check ; predators check ; space marines ; umm space marines ? okay who took out the space marines and put in this fodder . some surprise moments and some thrills but not nearly enough and avp is over way to fast . everything is speeded up and suspense is simply zero . both the entire series of alien movies and the first predator film depended upon moments of silence to build up the suspense . -lrb- nothing really happens at all of the first hour of alien for example . -rrb- this movie on the other hand moves so much like a video game you will be reaching for the controller . the predators look okay but the aliens are too cartoonish and seem to change size at random . the plot and the back-story are simply inept . what is wrong with an alien queen in the new york subway system or predators fighting in iraq ? heck putting them in an office block , cruise ship or shopping mall at christmas would be preferable . -lrb- the predators take out the orange julius while the alien queen makes her nest in victoria secret . -rrb- the fun of aliens on earth is watching them walk into a and taking out some customers not fighting in a silly pyramid that could be on any planet in the universe .		5		0
ridley scott is one of my favorite directors of all time . three of his movies are among favorites . but since `` gladiator '' , he has n't really made anything truly epic . this does n't mean his past movies are bad they 're just not as epic . `` robin hood '' unfortunately continues this trend . my greatest fear of this movie was that it was going to be a `` gladiator 2 '' , particularly with russell crowe in the lead . fortunately it does n't run into this issue . instead , the movie lacks oomph and motivation . there are some great actors in this film , but they are n't at their full potential . russell crowe is low-key in this film . he is n't the action hero we remember from gladiator . this could be because he 's a decade older , but when does age hold an actor back from being brilliant ? in addition , there 's no real motivation in his character . i do n't understand why he bad mouths the king and at the same time decides to go on a crusade to save england from french invaders . i wish there was more development in his character , as well as in the others . cate blanchett is both beautiful and fierce as maid marian . she always makes a great performance , but once again , i wish there was more breathing room for her character to breathe , particularly with her relationship to robin . in one scene she ca n't stand him and the next kisses him . what ? i think she 's past puberty . the other thing that got on my nerves was how the first hour of the film was structured . it jumped around a lot from subplot to subplot . it was difficult for me to keep up . at times it was hard to tell who was on whose side . then again , the whole film is about scheme and backstabbing . at least the screenwriter tied it all together at the end . in the technical aspects though , this film does n't lack . there is great production design and costumes that are n't too glamorous -lrb- fitting the time period of stark contrast between poor rags and gallant knight armor -rrb- . i really loved john mathieson 's cinematography . it is beautiful and gritty . i even enjoyed marc streitenfeld 's score . it was new without relying on the gladiator tone that i love , but gets overused in many movies nowadays . so , what 's opinion on this film ? not too bad but not special either . since i 'm generous , i give it 2.5 / 4 . i enjoyed the time i was in the theater , but i wo n't buy it when comes out on dvd . on a final note , do n't let the pg-13 rating fool you . it may not have lopped off heads or blood spraying in slow motion , but it is still plenty of violent . it 's still nowhere near violent on ridley scott scale though .		5		0
average . that is the word to define this film and its implausible shenanigans . overly long the premise sadly does not engage to be given such a period of running time . following nicholas van orton , played by michael douglas , we are introduced to a wealthy yet insular and empty individual . as a present from his younger brother , played by the under-used sean penn , events unravel which begin ` the game ' . ` the unforgiving , the script is contrived and lacks a big dose of logic . nicholas van orton , an investment banker forgoes common sense in situations which demand attention . it seems that the film is driven by its own arrogance , it bypasses gaping holes in order to run across a finish line which has no audience . the story is a meshing of twists and bluffs that i 'm afraid are just silly , the film does not surprise , as i 'm sure it was meant to , nor act as a taut tense thriller , as i 'm sure it was meant to . mere average .		5		0
`` the 40 year old virgin '' too gross for me , but the audience loved it . reviews , articles , and even an interview on terry gross ' `` fresh air '' lead me to believe that this movie was a tad more adult than it is . in fact it is a gross-out , comedy . it opens with a graphic description of a stage show involving a horse and a mexican girl , probably a sex slave . it includes graphic scenes of vomit and urine being splashed in the main character 's face . women 's bodies are major sources of humor , with punchlines like , `` do n't put -lrb- vulgar term for women -rrb- on a pedestal , '' and visual gags like a woman 's breast coming out of her shirt , with the completely unlikely result that she is unaware of it and fails to cover it up . all the male characters , no matter their chronological age , are boys . there is a lengthy scene where two unattractive men -lrb- what happened to the cute , young paul rudd of `` clueless '' ? is he already fat and balding ? -rrb- play violent video games while making homophobic `` jokes . '' as in all the teen boy gross out comedies , from `` jay and silent bob strike back '' to `` wedding crashers , '' though these boys are terrified of homosexuals , the only `` love '' they are capable of feeling is for other men . the audience i was with loved this movie . they laughed out loud in several spots ; there was much more laughter than in any movie i 've seen in a while -- certainly more than at `` wedding crashers . '' steve carrell was wonderful . `` the daily show '' did n't prepare me for how much movie star charisma he has . the scene where his chest hair is removed is an instant classic , and will become a kinky favorite among some fetishists , i 'm sure . otherwise , though ... i was n't ready for a gross-out , teen boy , woman-hating movie , and this one left me feeling icky . i hope to see carrell in something a bit more grown-up and classy someday .		5		0
nick parker is a blind vietnam vet presumed dead for years who tracks down an old war buddy and gets unwittingly involved in kidnapping and murder . despite his handicap , he determines to rescue his friend and his friend 's son from some sleazy reno . loosely based on the old japanese zatoichi / shintaro katsu movies of the sixties , this is a pretty agreeable little thriller with an offbeat premise , a great cast , some good stuntwork and many nice moments - the chase in the cornfield , the old routine , the relationship between hauer and call , the final showdown with kosugi . but , as with too many action films , it 's nothing special ; there 's no real atmosphere , a lot of the characters are just stock goons , the score is weak and the production seems half-hearted , as if nobody was really passionate about the movie . it 's a pleasant way to kill time but with the talent of these people it should be much better -lrb- see for example noyce 's later rabbit-proof fence -rrb- . it 's still fun though , and hauer is terrific in the lead as usual , with fine support from o'quinn -lrb- here billed as terrance for some reason -rrb- , the foster and the iconic cobb -lrb- lenny the biker from raising arizona -rrb- . cassavetes and overton seem to be having a whale of a time as a pair of goofy hoodlum brothers called lyle and tector pike , who wind up shooting each other . this movie makes me a bit cross - hauer puts more into it than it deserves , and with a bit more care and originality it could have been something special , but instead it 's fairly flat and formulaic . produced by well-known actor tim matheson and a very bad director called dan , and shot in houston and reno .		5		0
now jack frost is neither a bad movie or a good movie . it is fine for the family , and it certainly starts off well with a very promising 20 minutes . i also liked the premise of the film , about a musician who dies in a car accident and comes back to life in the form of a snowman to spend time with his neglected son . the soundtrack is great , and the film is nice to look at . the performances are decent from joseph cross and kelly preston and michael keaten while he has been better does well . however , i was not sure what the movie was trying to accomplish . what i mean by that is that it seemed as though it was striving to be a poignant father and son type film and a film full of slapstick comedy . unfortunately due to the weak script , the film does n't really succeed at either . the pace is also rather uneven , being slow at times , and the ending is rather schmaltzy . plus the special effects are in general substandard . all in all , not terrible , but it could have been better . 5/10 bethany cox		5		0
title : doom -lrb- 2005 -rrb- director : andrzej bartkowiak cast : the rock , karl urban , rosamund pike review : i 've never had the opportunity to play doom the video game so i cant really compare this movie to the video game . i have read that the movie changed the storyline of the game around a bit and instead of mars being infested by demons from hell , well mars gets infested by a bunch of experiments gone wrong . but ill just stick to reviewing the movie and thats it , no comparisons to the game . a group of scientist are conducting an archaeological dig on the surface of mars when they stumble across a skeleton that has 24 chromosomes . thats one more chromosome then the rest of humanity has and according to their research , this 24th chromosome can make humans gain super strength and healing abilities . so they begin to experiment with the 24th chromosome and in doing so they unwillingly create a race of creatures that slowly but surely begins to eliminate the whole colony . thats when the rock and his team of rock em sock em marine soldiers gets called up to fix things in mars . i honestly expected this movie to be a huge pile of crap . the rock ? in space ? i thought , `` boy , how the mighty have fallen '' . but guess what , i actually found myself enjoying this flick . well , part of it anyway . you see , for its first half , this film is essentially , step by step , a remake of aliens . you know , the drill . marines come down to complex , they start investigating the poorly lit corridors , something moves in the shadows ... what is it ? they find a survivor ! anyhows , its a by the numbers marines investigating spooky abandoned scientific complex type of thing . you get the picture . cool thing about this movie though , is that once it gets past all that crap we have already seen before in a million other rip offs , we get to the good stuff . and this is when i got up and actually said `` this movies just turned cool ! '' . the monsters , action and gore get turned up pretty high and i loved that ! stan winston studios were in charge of creating the creature effects for this film and the did a great job . the monsters are a nice mix of `` man in suit '' effects and some cgi . but for the most part , they do n't use that much cgi which made things feel more real and organic which was great in my book . the monsters are kept in the shadows for a lot of the movie , but i guess this works in a positive way since this is a horror/action film . there 's one sequence that really stood out as incredibly cool . its the `` first person shooter '' sequence . basically what this sequence tries to achieve is duplicate the gaming experience of walking along dark hallways with a huge guns blowing away monsters , demons and zombies . and its all done in one fluid continuous shot . you feel like you really get up close and personal with the creatures that pop out of every corner and when one of those creatures is holding a huge chainsaw in one of its hands . . well , you know you are in for some fun . i 'm happy to inform that the rock actually did a good job with his acting here . he has a mean streak to him and a bad ass attitude with this role . and the ending has a nice twist to it that i loved . once i saw the rock was going to have a `` mano a mano '' with somebody else i said `` oh no , were gon na have us a wwf match here '' . but happily , the fight had almost no wrestling inspired moves , thank god . the fight at the end was actually very very entertaining . so all in all , what we have here is a pretty entertaining flick that delivers what it promises . hey its a doom movie , its got lots of guns , lots of and gore . whats not to like ? remember , once you get past the boring `` been there done that '' first half , the good stuff comes in . rating : 3 1/2 out of 5		5		0
this movie was just ok . it did n't rock my world or turn me into a fanatic , though i did enjoy the first matrix . however , several things unveiled in this flick sort of ruined it for me . warning ! spoilers ! 1 -rrb- the ` deep , meaningful ' speeches told me absolutely nothing . these pretentious , pompous , pseudo-philosophical which permeated this flick in profusion are utterly butt-numbing . my vote for ` most orating ' goes to ... morpheus and that french guy 's chocolate cake ! 2 -rrb- people who gave this movie a 10 just because of `` the really cool c.g.i fights and c.g.i car chase scenes '' . if you c.g.i me i can do all that neo does and more ! i do n't even have to know how to * do * karate ! or even how to throw a convincing punch ! and how come everybody insists on wearing sun glasses in dark rooms and caves ? 3 -rrb- every single zion scene . these were totally worthless ! the best of the worst had to be the `` zion with and '' . how come they did n't set up their defenses , or prepare themselves for the war ? -lrb- motto must be `` make love not war ! '' -rrb- there was no feeling that they were in actual danger . all we see is another day in the life of the average new-age hippy . go machines !! 4 -rrb- extended scene between our hero and girlfriend . we did not have to endure a useless and un-erotic sex scene to remind us that neo truly , deeply loves trinity . no further explanation is required ! 5 -rrb- we see almost nothing of the danger about to wipe out zion . instead we just hear more long-winded speeches proclaiming the danger that is * the machines * . all say and no see really starts to grate on your nerves after two hours of watching this flick . 6 -rrb- as for ` deep and meaningful ' , the only thing deep and meaningful i received was a sore butt from sitting for so long ... it felt like i was simply watching my home pc , infected with a virus because i -lrb- the user -rrb- opened a virus-infected email attachment -lrb- agent smith -rrb- . we have the unsuccessful virus protection program -lrb- neo -rrb- trying to eradicate it . then we have our useless free roaming programs -lrb- oracle , key maker , architect , french dude -rrb- taking up the rest of the hard drive space . since this computer does n't contain enough memory for all this junk it eventually causes the hard drive to crash -lrb- zion 's destruction -rrb- . and what is the matrix ? the internet sigh ! i hope i 'm wrong and this is n't what * the trilogy * is about ! conclusion ? what the heck is this `` to be continued '' ?? in the old 60 's tv series batman and robin , yes ! in the matrix reloaded 2003 , no !! 5/10		5		0
opening at it does with close-ups of hieronymus bosch 's `` garden of earthly delights , '' accompanied by the and pleadings of the lost souls of the damned , 1975 's `` the devil 's rain '' initially promises one sinister stew indeed . unfortunately -- and i know i 'm probably going to antagonize many of my fellow baby boomers who grew to love this film after repeated late-night tv viewings -- the picture soon revealed itself to this first-timer to be a shlocky , minor effort ; one that is at times rather confusing , with an plot and some overripe performances . in it , a reincarnated -lrb- ? -rrb- satanic leader named corbis , played by ernest borgnine , goes after the modern-day members of the preston family -lrb- consisting of matriarch ida lupino and sons william `` '' shatner and tom skerritt -rrb- in order to recover a book of lost souls , stolen from him in . the film , to its credit , features an interesting initial third , in which shatner goes up against corbis alone , but soon devolves into decidedly satanic rites and the ludicrous spectacle of uncle ernie somehow , and inexplicably , transformed into the likeness of old scratch himself . the picture 's celebrated `` meltdown '' sequence begins in a mysterious manner -- having to do with the destruction of the container of devil 's rain or something -- and , impressive as it is , it ca n't hold a black mass candle to the flaming deaths of the satanists under the shadow of the cross in the 1960 british thriller `` horror hotel . '' with that fun cast -lrb- plus eddie albert , keenan wynn and a barely recognizable john travolta -rrb- , the film is always interesting to watch , but remains a mixed bag that should 've been much better . and oh ... can anyone out there explain the film 's final 30 seconds to me ?!?!		5		0
-lrb- spoilers -rrb- lasse 's `` safe haven '' is not a bad movie , however it 's not blazing any trails at all . no , here we have the late 2000s style thriller/drama replete with almost everything unsurprising . the movie reminds of `` the gift '' . the story is linear and simple with some genuine scenes , and excellent settings . smaller supporting actors were well chosen and directed . however some of the dialog especially coming from the father -lrb- josh duhamel -rrb- comes off as ridiculous - especially he calling her out in broad daylight on the supposed wanted persons flyer . that transition was terribly coarse and fake . lead actress julianne hough struck me as much too plain , , vanilla , and most especially young for her role . it was like widower father going after a college freshman - age gap was over 10 years and noticeably poppycock . these are smallish things but additive . so like many other movies of late , this is a mediocre affair . not really recommended but certainly above a turkey .		5		0
usually , we think of wes craven 's movies as really cool . `` the hills have eyes '' would likely be the one that splits people . an absolutely disgusting story of an all-american family getting stranded in a desert inhabited by cannibals , the movie leaves nothing to the imagination . there may be points in the movie where you have to remind yourself that it 's only a movie ; some of the scenes they really could have done without . still , if we accept this as a cheap '70s exploitation flick , then it 's not bad at all . but i must warn you , only watch it if you have a very strong stomach . and yes , that 's dee wallace -lrb- aka et 's mom -rrb- as lynne .		5		0
in a nod to 70s movies like the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre -lrb- and others -rrb- , house of 1000 corpses , while being the farthest away from even a decent slasher movie , does manage to weaken the stomach with its singularly twisted images of an insane family of cannibals who prey on a quartet of young twenty-somethings who happen to come within their reach and become fodder for their truly sick entertainment . were it not for karen black , one would n't be sure these are actually actors playing their roles as if they were those barbaric , mentally defective sadistic killers , and while clearly rob zombie knows enough of movies to throw in a variety of references to marx brothers movies as well as slasher classics , the very inhuman nature of the movie will be so forbidding that only hardcore lovers of this sort of movie will see it .		5		0
this is so old old old old old-fashioned movie ! sometimes -lrb- ridley scott -rrb- makes a movie for his own spirit . sometimes he makes one for the studio . this is definitely one for the studio , yet without his spirit , or any spirit ! what could be new in this movie about robin hood ? i must say the storyline of his relationship with marion , the talk about his father , and that 's about it ! so what was distinct ? frankly nothing ! -lrb- scott -rrb- collected some talents around him to do a movie . and they did . as blandly as they could ! aside from looking a bit old , -lrb- russell crowe -rrb- was not special . the role was awfully lesser than him , with no details of any kind . he seemed like a robot that repeats occasionally `` ask me nicely '' ! -lrb- cate blanchett -rrb- looked unsightly mannish , and also the role gave her no deep or discrete thing to do . forget any relief , the side characters had been treated horribly . king richard 's brother was written in unbelievably bad way ; he 's not a joke of a person -lrb- the way he was in prince of thieves -rrb- , and he 's not a strong unfair tyrannical either -lrb- remember that the power of the hero comes from the power of his enemy -rrb- . a plot hole annoyed me very ; how all the workers at the farm of -lrb- blanchett -rrb- 's husband do n't know the face of their master who went to war just 10 years ago , while they were all more than 10-year-old to me ! i did n't watch any real good action sequences . the last battle was a brief news . you know , the poster showed -lrb- crowe -rrb- brandishing his sword screaming in great anger . well , i did n't see any brandishing , sword , screaming , or anger ! the cinematography is mostly gray ; i did n't figure it out , is it the dark ages ? , is it a way to reach a case of black and white movie ? , or is it the sensation of scott while doing this ? i 'll go for the last prospect ! although there is tight pace but no inner liveliness , since everything i saw was made before yet with feeling . i was bored to death at the second part , for instance during the last battle i wanted to leave anyhow , or simply sleep in my seat . i refused to do both , but i could n't deter myself from non-stop ; this movie causes that perfectly ! save 2 or 3 lines of dialog , a scene about the crusades ' shameful crimes , another about the socialism that did n't find a way during the age of feudalism and , added to some sound effects , i found nothing interesting . there is no fun , action , or emotionally moving moment . entertaining is an irrelevant word to this movie . damn . there was a thick sheet of glass between us and the screen , or rather between the movie makers and the movie itself ! after the postman -lrb- 1997 -rrb- , blood work -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , the sin eater -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , and now robin hood -lrb- 2010 -rrb- i must be cautious towards anything -lrb- brian helgeland -rrb- may write again . though i believe i was late to understand the wink -lrb- scott -rrb- gave at the start . with ancient boards that tell the whole story of the movie , which we were about to see , it is an enough confession that there would be nothing to watch after . and there is n't indeed . this is a deadly ordinary b movie . i would admire it if it was made in the 1950s , however it is n't , and it sure lacks that time 's wit as well . -lrb- scott -rrb- did it against his will . it shows . otherwise , he aimed at making his most tasteless work ever . so , i 'll wait for his next movie ; or , in all probability , the one he gave -lrb- robin hood -rrb- for the studio to be capable of doing it later ! in general , any known -lrb- robin hood -rrb- movie is better than it . the most movie i hated for -lrb- scott -rrb- , -lrb- legend -rrb- , is better than it , since it had a true desire to look and feel different . even a recent one -lrb- knight and day -rrb- , while being a faulty idiot is better than it ; at least it has dancing music during the action sequences , that 's a kind of modernism for god 's sake ! p.s : a couple were setting in front of me at the theater . right after the end she asked him unimpressed `` what do you think ? '' , he told her seriously `` usual , but the music is great '' . well , i do agree with him , except that i do n't see that the music was great !		5		0
carpenter 's `` halloween '' , after all these years , still holds a very high place on the list of best horror movies ever . zombie 's `` halloween '' should n't be compared to original cause that is impossible . zombie 's work stands alone and try to judge zombie 's try , that is not that bad after all . cause zombie went from the beginning , from michael myers childhood . michael was a different from others and that is way he was humiliated in school but he was even humiliated at his home . from his drunk stepfather to his older sister . the only persons he loved were his mother and his little sister and that 's because they showed him some love . i am not trying to say that michael would turn out to be normal man without humiliation that he had to put up on all sides , cause clearly it was something wrong with him . those teasing from his surrounding only helped to make him the real michael myers . and even there zombie makes a turn ; the best scene in this movie is the one when michael first gets to his sister -lrb- when they are grown up and alone in that room -rrb- . one commentary excellently says that zombie tried to give a monster a soul . and that is true . so try to watch zombie 's movie from this point of view . even tough there are big minuses in this movie : from bad acting to a slaughter without any sense . if you can not ignore this `` minor '' things , this movie is not for you . of course legendary danny trejo has a role in this one -lrb- why am i not surprised -rrb- . oh , and also the casting of daeg faerch for the role of young myers is brilliant . he is so creepy and great at the same time -lrb- the only good thing except zombie 's soul monster in this movie -rrb- .		5		0
the mothman prophecies is a creepy thriller that does n't make as big as an impact as you would expect . based on true events , the film examines a series of inexplicable occurrences through the eyes - and mind - of one man played by richard gere . the plot sounds creepy and the fact that its based on true events sure makes it more engaging . the film looks and sounds scary as well and there are a few scenes that are bound to get underneath your skin . the film is still kind of disappointing as they do n't really explain the movie so well and your left with too many unanswered questions . sometimes its hard to take the movie seriously as there are some scenes that do n't make sense or that the scene kind of feels like a joke . like said before though , the film should still creep underneath your skin . richard gere stars and he gives a very good performance . he makes up for starring in that awful film called autumn in new york . laura linney also does a good and these two really keep the film moving . mark pellington directs and he does a good job of keeping the film at a nice pace and making the film look creepy . the ending was done decently and it sure makes you think about what happens . the mothman prophecies will leave its mark on you and you may have trouble getting it out of your head when its time to go to sleep . the film is almost two hours long so you may start to get bored if you find the film to be stupid . pretty much if you like the x-files or the forgotten then you should enjoy this thriller . the mothman prophecies may not be top notch thriller but its still worth checking out and will make a good rental to watch at night . rating 6.7 / 10 a sometimes scary thriller that 's worth checking out .		5		0
when a well meaning but overly trusting security guard -lrb- matthew broderick -rrb- is wounded in an explosion created by the evil dr. claw , a beautiful scientist named brenda -lrb- joely fisher -rrb- takes him under her wing and turns him into a crime fighting machine by replacing his limbs with a wealth of gadgets and gimmicks . now dubbed inspector gadget , the security guard can fulfill his dream of becoming a crime fighting detective , and as he investigates his first case namely , who blew him up . he finds out that the man responsible also killed brenda 's father . now it 's up to the inspector to find the killer 's identity and bring him to justice , using his homegrown bionic powers to crack the case . i went to the theater to watch this , i should have waited for it to come out on video . inspector gadget was n't a horrible film , but pretty average at best . i guess it was the casting of matthew broderick as gadget this role did n't fit him , i will stay with the cartoon .		5		0
silly satire about a seriously demented cecil -lrb- stephen dorff -rrb- and his ragtag group kidnapping a popular actress -lrb- melanie griffith -rrb- and forcing her to star in their indie film . the acting is good -lrb- especially dorff and alicia witt -rrb- and it has funny moments , but it does n't hang together -- it seems to be a series of skits instead of one cohesive story . also , waters is no longer the cutting edge filmmaker he thinks he is . he 's distressingly mainstream -lrb- ok , weird mainstream -rrb- . the film is very forgettable and does n't even come close to his early work . too bad . like i said , it 's better than `` pecker '' , but that 's faint praise . still this is a bit more `` gayer '' than his other works and dorff is easy on the eyes .		5		0
though it 's named after and supposedly about the groundbreaking all-girl rock band of the 1970s , a more accurate title and description of this film would be `` the rise and fall of cherie currie , guest starring joan jett and with a special appearance by kim fowley '' . they just took the story currie wrote in her book about her life , sandwiched in some stuff with jett and let michael shannon tear the scenery apart with his bare teeth . if you wanted to look back through the decades and know who the runaways were and why they were important , this movie will only give you a glimmer of a clue . maybe they were so much of their moment that you ca n't really appreciate them if you were n't there at the time . the fact remains this motion picture does n't tell you anything you ca n't see on any one of a hundred `` behind the music '' shows on vh-1 . with that , however , the runaways is still a satisfactory little flick . kristen stewart is great , as always , and michael shannon is out the door , down the street , into your home and having sex with your mother as the runaways ' almost record producer . dakota fanning is reel purty but is n't asked to do much besides glower or look forlorn . the musical sequences are quite good and there are a couple of moments when writer/director floria sigismondi does an excellent job visually projecting what it 's like to be inside the cyclone of sex , drugs and rock 'n roll . the movie also touches on the sexism the group had to endure and combat , but only in the most clichéd and hackneyed of ways . as rock bio-pics go , there sure have been a lot worse than this . what keeps it from being any better is that cherie currie 's story dominates the movie and it simply is n't that interesting . she 's a 15 year old with looks and attitude who got plucked from obscurity to be the band 's lead singer , could n't handle the hard life of being a rock star and crashed back to reality . joan jett 's tale of ambition and determination takes a decided back seat and the other members of the runaways can be entirely described as `` the jealous one '' , `` the lesbian one '' and `` the one who barely has any lines and might as well be a mic stand '' . the best parts are when shannon 's kim fowley is completely blunt and ruthless in the molding of these girls young enough to be his daughters into icons of rock , but that largely disappears for the 2nd half of the film . the most intriguing part is how cherie 's older sister marie -lrb- riley keough -rrb- transforms herself into a mirror image of her little sis . that image suggests so much but none of it is ever explored . if every member of the band had been given a fair share of the narrative and it had focused more on the struggles between the runaways and fowley and between them and the rest of the world , i ca n't help but think that would have been a much more compelling story . especially because the look of the movie is outstanding in how it captures the zeitgeist of the 1970s . i 'm not sure any character 's appearance has better symbolized that era of cultural decadence and stylistic chaos than fowley 's . if you 're a fan of this group , this genre or this time period , you 'll probably enjoy the runaways . nobody else needs to rush out and watch it , but there 's no reason anyone should n't give it a look .		5		0
not great , but not awful . on the plus side , the director and actors obviously are n't taking any of this seriously and they are just out to have fun . the title says it all ... you get lots and lots of zombies , including some `` smart zombie '' strippers . some of the lines are just plain hilarious , especially in context , and some of the actors actually do a good job in delivering them . there are plenty of quality stripper moments , but this is a double-edged sword because ... on the negative side , the strippers are all bizarrely enhanced -lrb- if you know what i mean , and i think that you do -rrb- and rather odd looking . -lrb- holy cow , jenna ! do n't try to get anything you have any tighter than it already is , or you 'll roll up like an old-fashioned window shade . -rrb- the left wing `` political satire '' also gets a bit old after the first ten or fifteen minutes . -lrb- ok , ok ... we get it . george w. bush is a pawn of greedy capitalists . -rrb- the digital effects vary wildly , with some being quite good and others being almost childish . the make-up effects are universally pretty good . the soundtrack is above-average , with some killer songs snatched from here and there . strangely , the deleted scenes included on the dvd are better than a lot of what made it to the screen . in fact , some of the deleted scenes are just great . be sure to check out the special features if you rent the dvd . highly recommended for people who understand what a movie called `` zombie strippers '' is likely to be .		5		0
you take de niro and edward norton out of the equation and this is just a movie about milla jovovich as a slutty wife . this movie only appealed to me for the simple fact of edward norton being attached . i could careless about de niro or jovovich for that matter . it shows that norton is n't a one-hit wonder with fight club . he 's more than just a narrator . however , with that being said ... this movie is a big let down . it takes 20 minutes to get the basic foundation laid out . it has slow pacing and long cuts that make the movie feel dragged on . it has no real pay off ending . it kind of leaves you hanging with the question , `` that was it ? '' it has mediocre acting from de niro and jovovich as it is clearly all about norton . it has a lot of redundant subplots and its opening is just ridiculous . i am very disappointed with my delay of seeing this and finding out why it was n't discussed by anyone nor given a big release . as one of the biggest box office flops i 've ever seen , i ca n't believe that this movie actually was able to carry the same story for more than 90 minutes . this movie should n't have been more than 80 minutes -lrb- maybe -rrb- but it runs to 105 minutes . it felt more like two hours with the irrelevant dialogue and unnecessary scenes and sloth-like editing . i would n't recommend this to anyone unless you 're desperate for the chance to see milla 's breasts or simulating intercourse . it 's an underwhelming film , aside from watching norton pound out an awesome performance . not an oscar-worthy performance , but a memorable one . he 's the only good thing in this under-handed film .		5		0
after his family is killed by a bloodthirsty monster , handsome teenager connor paolo -lrb- as martin -rrb- is adopted by vampire hunter nick damici -lrb- as mister -rrb- , who seemingly appears out of nowhere . for reasons unexplained , mr. damici dresses the young man in football shoulders and a helmet . damici trains mr. paolo in the art of vampire slaying . welcome to the `` stake land '' . vamps have overrun most of the urban areas . makes sense , that 's where most blood flows . there is some resistance in rural areas , but danger from wicked michael cerveris -lrb- as jebedia loven -rrb- . while heading to hopeful `` new eden '' in canada , paolo and damici pick up nun kelly mcgillis -lrb- as sister -rrb- , pregnant danielle harris -lrb- as belle -rrb- and marine sean nelson -lrb- as willie -rrb- ... directed by jim mickle and co-written with his co-star , this is an intriguing story ... the apocalyptic atmosphere is conveyed well and is complimented by vampire sympathizers and religious zealots ... however , much of what happens seems disconnected and unsatisfying . early on , we 're aware paolo has a vitamin deficiency , although he always appears very healthy . maybe the diagnosis was wrong ; there is never any explanation offered . he is also taken to a barber for a haircut , although he already has nicely styled hair and it looks no shorter after being cut . considering the state of the world , cut your own hair . we go from these minor mysteries to major ones - and , then there 's the ending . the easiest answers lead back to the first one - why damici picked paolo . possibly , it 's a christian-based father and son allegory ; father takes son to the `` garden of eden '' . paolo occasionally narrates , but he ever answered any of this viewer 's questions . ***** stake land -lrb- -rrb- jim mickle ~ connor paolo , nick damici , kelly mcgillis , danielle harris		5		0
recap : doug is the assistant manager at the local . and soon they will be opening a new market , and doug sees the possibility to step up to full manager . he sees his chance to buy a house , to get happiness for himself and for his girlfriend . and his manager says he is a shoe-in . but suddenly richard turns up from canada and provides unexpected competition . suddenly everything is up for grabs , and both doug and richard are determined to grab it . at all costs . comments : this did n't really live up to my expectations . truth to be told , i had quite high expectations . but that sort of comes when you have sean william scott and john c reilly as your stars . both have proved before to be really good at making good comedies , and from the trailer i expected this was another one . unfortunately , i did n't think this was one of them . i expected it to be high paced one after another . sure , a lot of them would be rather pointless , and some of them would go over , or should i say under , the line . but i expected that those would be small exceptions . instead it is the good jokes that seem to be the exception . not that it is filled with bad jokes either , there just seem to be long stretches of voids in between them . stretches where both doug -lrb- especially -rrb- and richard dig their respective holes deeper , by themselves . not because of constantly mischievous scheming , plotting and sabotaging each other , as i got the feeling from the trailer . it does have some good points , but fell at its own hands . they promised a lot more than they could deliver . 5/10		5		0
some people get turned on by ` nasty ' things . car crashes are ` nasty ' things . put those two statements together and what do we learn ? some people get turned on by car crashes . yes ?? and ?? those looking for further insight will most likely be left disappointed . the movie pretty much leaves it at that . i found the sex scenes were n't as cold as some have suggested -lrb- although they definitely were n't my bag -rrb- and it was good to see something a little bit different from the mainstream , but it was hardly what i 'd term a revelatory experience . quality actors working with weird material . serious fans of the cinema should see it at least once , because whatever else it does n't do , it gets people talking , but it certainly ai n't a masterwork ... see it to derail the pc brigade ; but when all was said and done , i was left feeling that all the brouhaha generated over ` crash ' was very much a storm in a tea cup . that goes for both the sex scenes and the film itself ...		5		0
i was eagerly anticipating the new seth rogen vehicle observe and report . jody hill was back as orchestrator , like with foot fist way , but this time he had an established star at the front . the trailer looked like it might cross over into dark territory and i was all for it . unfortunately , when the tide does change , when imbecility becomes psychopathic , not only does the film become a tad uncomfortable and odd , but also slow and boring . there are some funny moments -- even at the end -- however , overall , the film just plain falls flat . you do n't think much can go wrong with a simple premise about a mall security guard and a guy like rogen leading the way . heck , kevin james made a killing with paul blart and that just looked like mindless stupidity . something about this film looked as though it might be relevant . it had the chance to delve into the insecurities and masks that a twenty-something year old with responsibility in a joke of a job puts on to keep sane and important . perhaps there would be an evolution , some growth from immature headcase to heroic hourly employee that gets the girl . well , i 'm here to say that observe and report is nothing of the sort . by using the inclusion of rogen 's ronnie barnhardt 's prescription drug use , medication to help cut his bi-polar tendencies , as a cause for him to just go crazy , hill takes the story to a much blacker place than expected . it only takes one seemingly innocuous exchange , the declaration that his life is going so good he does n't need to take pills anymore , to allow a slightly deranged , but in check -- `` let 's use our inside voices '' -- man become the rage hidden beneath his awkward exterior . oh , and let 's not worry about writing in consequences or anything . the darkness includes heavy drug use , extended male frontal nudity , -lrb- there is a streaker on the loose after all -rrb- , excessive violence at the hand of batons and flashlights , and a shooting that is so surprising and appropriate in its own strange way that i actually loved it . what is once a mission to gain respect and self-worth , the need to find a criminal who has sexually assaulted the girl of his dreams to prove to the real cops he has what it takes , spirals out of control . the absurdity of it all can be appreciated , and the turns it takes can be seen as bold yet fitting , but in the end , what was the point of it all ? loose ends are tied up , no one really suffers , and bad people remain very , very bad , if not worse . maybe its all a commentary on the utter selfishness of consumerism and the people employed as cogs in its grand machine , whether they mall workers or customers , but i think that is giving too much credit . i believe all those shots of eccentric , possibly unaware real shoppers are there to serve as a mirror for society 's gluttony and greed . the actual plot and storyline , though , that 's just an excuse to get as crazy as you want and not have to worry about repercussions . observe and report did attract some talent , so you have to believe all involved saw something that they felt needed to be expressed . anna faris plays pretty much the same character she does in everything , the bimbo slutty girl all the guys want , -lrb- i still ca n't get past her lips and how ugly they make her look -rrb- , and ray liotta takes another role that allows him to have some fun and collect a paycheck , something that appears to be par for the course at this point in his career . i really enjoyed michael peña 's turn as dennis . his speech impediment and gangsta stylings are priceless , especially for a guy that is most known and praised for stellar dramatic turns . definitely the highlight of the film , i laughed every time he opened his mouth , even when his character took a turn , much like the film , that was oddly appropriate if not completely out of left field . the true shining light , however , is collette wolfe as a coffee shop cashier in a leg brace . her purity is on display in stark contrast to everything else , begging to finally be a catalyst to some event in ronnie 's life . she was subtle and by far the most natural part of the movie , definitely the focal point we could ground ourselves with as the world of the mall is turned upside-down . and that brings me to seth rogen . he is great in this role , do n't get me wrong , but i just do n't know why he thought he needed to do it . sure he gets to smack kids around with skateboards and push people over as he pursues a naked , chubby man through the mall , but it 's a thankless role as far as moral ambiguity goes . the audience can never feel as though he deserves anything . he throws away or is blind to all the good in his life and he falls pray to urges that will do nothing but harm him . i guess maybe the film works as a cautionary tale for parents to not raise their kids drunk and to push them into following their dreams . unfortunately , through it all , not only does rogen not reach his dreams , he shatters them and should be thrown in jail or an institution for the rest of his life as a result . instead , though , what do you think happens ? i 'll just pose the question : do you think he gets the girl , and if so which one ? maybe bad things do bred happiness .		5		0
saturday night fever -lrb- 1977 -rrb- hey , there 's john travolta dancing and looking cute , and there 's a simple look at urban italian life without the mob in the 1970s , and there is some disco inferno . what more do you want ? hopefully not much , because there is a thin plot , some truly forgettable acting -lrb- except for travolta , who is spot on for this kind of flick -rrb- , and even the functional details like camera-work and editing are dull as milk . the lights dazzle at times , but do n't confuse that with good filming . and the soundtrack , of course -- there is the core of the movie , the defining disco sound of mainstream america . but hey , there 's john travolta , and dancing . turn it up .		5		0
to be honest i really enjoyed watching this movie for its first part . i liked the story and were it was going . everything got set up nicely but then suddenly things started to get from bad till worse for the movie . it 's as if the movie suddenly threw everything overboard and forgot all about telling a good story . the movie gets really messy and the story is hard to keep track on , not because it 's being so complicated but because it gets told so poorly and confusing . you 'll hardly feel involved with anything that is happening in this movie and with its main characters . i 'm also not sure who was supposed to be he main character and ` hero ' of this movie . at times it 's like its the van helsing character , while at others its simon sheppard or mary heller . it 's also really part of the reason why the movie feels so messy and definitely distant at times . it never seems like a really great idea to update a classic horror story to this present time . you have the feeling though that this movie still could had worked out , had it been more like it 's first 20 minutes or so . now it instead feels like a completely redundant and forgettable movie that tries to update the dracula story . because it is modern it 's also using lots of more modern effects . the special effects are not horrible but at parts they are however far from convincing , which also works distracting from the movie . the movie also has some weird casting , with gerard butler as the count dracula . unlike now days , early in his career butler was and looked like quite a softy . he therefore really is n't convincing or threatening enough as the movie its supposedly main villain . there are still of course far worse rendition of the story to watch out there but this movie surely also is n't among the most impressive or original ones . 5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/		5		0
this was an odd directorial choice for the farrelly brothers -lrb- `` dumb and dumber , '' `` there 's something about mary '' -rrb- . it 's an animated film -lrb- in parts -rrb- about the internal workings of a man 's body . the man is played by bill murray during the `` live action '' sequences . these are intercut with animated sequences that involve cells and and organs and so on and so forth voiced by the likes of william shatner , chris rock , laurence fishburne , david hyde pierce -lrb- niles from `` frasier '' -rrb- , kid rock and ron howard . the cells are all animated cartoon characters who look , talk and act like humans . they live in the vast metropolis of `` frank '' -lrb- murray 's character -rrb- . when he feels sick , the metropolis begins to wither away . chris rock voices one of frank 's defending cells who teams up with a special medical pill -lrb- swallowed by frank -rrb- to take on thrax -lrb- fishburne -rrb- , the maniacal germ causing frank to feel sick . if you think this sounds really weird , you 're right . it is . but it 's also very clever and unique . the problem is that the animation is poor , the vocal talents are a bit too self-conscious and the animation is almost too realistic at time - it originally got a pg-13 rating . it 's pretty seedy stuff . the live action sequences are okay but murray looks kind of out of it . overall i was disappointed because i expected something funnier and cleverer , when in fact the movie dies out really quick and resorts to lame jokes like popping on people .		5		0
some people consider `` marnie '' to be hitchcock 's last great film , but i have to disagree : not only is it far from a great movie , but hitchcock 's four following films -lrb- and i 've seen them all at least twice -rrb- are also superior to this one on nearly all levels . hitchcock works here with one of the poorest scripts of his career ; his pacing is inevitably sluggish , making us wait far too long for some revelations . but the most annoying aspect of `` marnie '' is the hokey , amateurish psychology ; by the ending you 'll be wondering : `` is that all they could come up with ? '' . the film is practically suspense-less , too , so anyone who wants to study the director 's career should start by choosing another entry in his filmography . even a hitchcock , however , has its redeeming features : one sequence involving a theft and a cleaning lady is ingenious -lrb- hitchcock shows his mastery there -rrb- and connery gives a suave , excellent performance , never seeming out-of-place , even though most of us have identified him -lrb- at least during his early period -rrb- with james bond . but i still think hitchcock missed the mark this time .		5		0
mario bava brings us this gaudy , bizarre sci-fi horror that , for all it 's flaws , proved to be quite an influential little film -lrb- a crew drawn to a planet by a radio signal , giant skeletons found in an old spaceship , crew members being picked off one by one ... . sounding familiar ? -rrb- that remains quite enjoyable but more so as a retro piece than as serious entertainment . the slim plot sees two spaceships investigating a mysterious planet and when they finally land the crew begin to turn on one another for no apparent reason . acted by a bunch of people who never really made enough impact to be that recognisable and full of laughable moments , planet of the vampires somehow overcomes the odds to provide a middle section that is genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric in places . having seen some of bava 's work before -lrb- black sunday aka mask of satan and bay of blood -rrb- i must say that i was wondering how he was going to build any atmosphere at all when working against the gaudy backdrop of the alien planet and sleek spaceships but he succeeds admirably . if you remember with fondness those cheap comics that tried to emulate the e.c. ethos without the gore factor and that always felt like a selection of tales suitable for either the twilight zone or the outer limits then this film is for you . it feels exactly like one of those little stories , complete with `` surprising '' punchline . see this if you like : galaxy of terror , alien , it ! the terror from beyond space .		5		0
this story takes place in early 1960 's suburban england where jenny -lrb- carey mulligan -rrb- is a 16 year old schoolgirl who is a cellist in the school orchestra and is aspiring to attend oxford . she meets and begins an affair with david -lrb- peter sarsgaard -rrb- who is at least twice her age . david is a con man , predator , pedophile , womanizer who has a mellow personality , slick demeanor and drives a sports car . his partners in deception and crime are the handsome jet-setter danny -lrb- dominic cooper -rrb- and danny 's elegant girlfriend helen -lrb- rosamund pike -rrb- . jenny 's parents jack and marjorie -lrb- alfred molina and cara seymour -rrb- are won over by david 's charm and have no reservations about the fact that their 16 year daughter is seeing a man in his thirties and so n't even inquire into his background or occupation . both the school 's headmistress miss walters -lrb- emma thompson -rrb- and jenny 's teacher miss stubbs -lrb- olivia williams -rrb- are concerned over jenny 's affair . walters for the benefit of the schools image and stubbs for jenny 's future . jenny has a polite neighborhood boy her age graham -lrb- matthew beard -rrb- interested in her but she sees him as just a kid with nothing to offer her . she wants expensive dinners , clothes , art , fine wines , jazz clubs and trips to the continent . from a screenplay by nick hornby adapted from a published memoir by lynn barber and based on her true experiences . directed by lone scherfig this has been nominated for three academy awards including best picture . i find that a stretch . best picture ? it 's a stylized jane piece but nothing worthy of a best picture nomination . more of a movie . mulligan is in nearly every scene but at 24 looks a little long in the tooth for 16 . her acting is over the top at times and forced at others . the film is too much to carry on her shoulders . the american sarsgaard is stiff and his acting is pretentious at best as a brit . molina is good as are thompson and williams in supporting roles but their dialog is laughable . cooper , pike and seymour have little to do and do nothing with their roles . the graham character is implausible but nicely played by beard . so many things are dropped in this film as they are about to develop and then we move on to something else like jenny 's cello playing . the entire story line although based on true life memoirs is also highly implausible and is nearly romanticized creepiness . i amazingly did n't care for any of the characters except for maybe miss stubbs i will give credit to the art department of andrew , ben smith and anna lynch robinson and costume designer odile . they should have been the ones with the nominations . i would give this a 5.5 out of 10 but not recommend it .		5		0
definitely a great beer and pizza movie with some lazy friends on a friday night , but a philosophical masterpiece about work , ennui , and nihilism , i think not . look , the point is action is action and here the action is just fine . unlike crank , or shoot 'em up however it ca n't find a post modern humor to it , it just plays the action too straight and too improbable , and the word that spring to mind is bathos . however , philosophy is great only if really tight and not pop dollops of pseudo meaning - there is not enough explanation , it 's all very mysterious , but simply not mystic enough . i would have liked less bullets and knives and more creativity in the action scenes - and finally at the end of the day the film ca n't cram in all we need to know in the time continuum provided . good , if violent , entertainment , but a good film ... uh huh ... no way .		5		0
ashton kutcher is one of the most , if not the most , overexposed `` celebrity '' now . most people ca n't even name a movie he was in . i 'm not a big fan of that 70 's show , where he made his name known , but after he made dude , where 's my car ? , i do n't think anyone thought he could ever be a credible actor . and the butterfly effect proves it . from a story that has been floating around hollywood for years -lrb- it took someone with the star power and epic acting skills of kutcher to get it greenlighted -rrb- , the butterfly effect has a great idea but is executed in such a mixed bag kind of way it 's hard to like it . evan -lrb- kutcher -rrb- has gone through a troubled childhood -lrb- filled with the stupidest kids you 've even seen on film -rrb- , and had experienced numerous blackouts . he 's better now , but finds a way to go back in time to change the horrifying events of his past . what he does n't realize -lrb- until the people would 've caught on as soon as possible -rrb- that everything he does affects his whole life ahead of him . it seems to affect kayleigh -lrb- amy smart -rrb- the most in each one , where she goes from sorority girl to waitress to prostitute . the like happens to everyone else evan knows . but no matter how much he screws it up , he keeps on truckin ' so that his life is perfect . this story is much like donnie darko -lrb- as it has been said multiple times -rrb- , but darko knows where its going and has a purpose . in the butterfly effect , it takes itself way too seriously . the first half of the movie is basically evan 's past , where troubling events take place . the second half is evan going back to fix his mistakes . the worst part is , evan does n't even think of helping others with these powers of his . there 's a scene in a movie theater -lrb- where they 're showing two new line cinema movies , obviously -rrb- , and some people unrelated to him get hurt . why not go back and stop that ? also , when evan goes back to save a mother and daughter , he does it for himself , not for the people that would be killed . and we 're supposed to feel along with this selfish character ? in a movie as dark and serious as this , it deals with silly topics , like time travel . time travel only works humorously -lrb- back to the future -rrb- or when explained properly -lrb- donnie darko -rrb- . neither occur in the butterfly effect . i had been told many times that to like this movie i could n't take it seriously . i tried not to , but the events that occur in the movie -lrb- including child porn and animal abuse -rrb- are impossible to take lightly . at least the movie deals with them in a serious matter . the concept is a pretty cool concept , but once again , it 's destroyed by the actual dialogue written . it 's all so basic and clichéd i could basically guess what they were about to say next . also , why must they have begun with a scene of the climax ? movies always do that , often for a purpose . there was no reason here . the whole movie was of the movie was basically revisited over and over again in the second half , which unnecessarily spends much of its time in a prison . on another note , i liked the way that everything tied together -lrb- i 'm not talking about the ending -rrb- and that the unanswered questions from throughout the movie were eventually taken into consideration , such as the purpose of evan 's blackouts . i watched the director 's cut , and the alternate ending seemed gutsy , but i really liked it . i read about the other ending , and i prefer this one . this almost seemed like a typical teen movie -lrb- more so than it already is -rrb- by the acting . kutcher ca n't act worth beans , and amy smart is n't exactly katherine hepburn either . the only two remarkable people in the cast were eric stoltz -lrb- as the aforementioned child pornographer -rrb- and ethan suplee -lrb- as evan 's goth roomate -rrb- , who always put in great acting jobs . but this movie , which is sure to wow the mtv generation , has a great idea at its fingertips , but ca n't seem the right way to execute it . my rating : 5/10 rated r for violence , sexual content , language and brief drug use .		5		0
with only the vaguest whiff of a story and a lack of character development even in bruce banner , the sort of tortured conflicted comic book character seemingly custom-made for character development , the incredible hulk really only has its special effects going for it . and while those are decent , a movie that is nothing but its special effects is not a movie . ed norton does n't really do much with the role . yes , i know ed norton is a brilliant actor prone to giving amazing performances , but he just does n't do that here ; mark rufallo 's laconic bruce banner in the avengers is far more interesting than norton 's here . frankly , i was just bored . not so bored that i stopped watching , but consistently restless and never drawn in .		5		0
the concept of transplanting a `` sane '' brain into the head of an `` insane '' body is far more interesting than the actual execution in `` frankenstein must be destroyed , '' yet another hammer horror entry that 's left me frustrated and dissatisfied . the film , with peter cushing at the helm as the mad but mannered doctor , is a definite plus ; the sets , suspense , and characterization are finely polished ; the movie itself is fairly strong for its first hour , but then ... it starts to fall down , down , down . it seems to take forever for the , ahem , `` monster '' to get down to business , and i had a big problem accepting this , because this time out , the creation is a morally upright do-gooder who , yes , can speak and act like a normal human being -lrb- the only monster makeup is a lobotomy scar -rrb- . i 'm all for lack of convention in horror films , but this attempt at grasping a higher intellectual plain just did n't work for me -- it should 've been marketed as a straight drama instead of a horror flick . there are some effective moments in the last act , but the monster left me conflicted up until the very end , resulting in a lukewarm experience . watch `` the curse of frankenstein '' again instead . 5/10		5		0
fairuza balk -- as the leader of a group of teen witches -- is such a commanding presence , it makes no sense for the filmmakers to try and pass her off as a high school misfit . she would have the kids at her beck and call , whether they liked it or not . alas , her character is given supernatural powers and naturally she goes over-the-edge . i wanted to see this movie go in a different direction : watching this girl overcome her odds without the powers . this is a formula thriller with no interest in character content or a plot that makes any sense . its aim is to introduce several characters and quickly have them turn on each other , thus setting the stage for a special showdown . rather a waste , especially since the cast is so strong and the technical aspects so gripping . you come away from `` the craft '' without much to chew on , except what went wrong and what possibilities were missed . ** from ****		5		0
`` laws of attraction '' is a highly derivative comedy starring pierce brosnan , julianne moore , and francis fisher . brosnan and moore play two aggressive new york attorneys who fight bitterly through divorce cases but an attraction keeps getting in their way . i would n't have wanted to pay $ 10.00 to see this in the theater , though i like the actors in it very much . it seemed very predictable , very lame , and a little too slick for me with moore playing a basically stereotypical character and fisher her more adventurous mother . someone commented that this was a `` screwball '' comedy - my idea of a screwball comedy is `` the awful truth '' and `` bringing up baby '' - this is not in that league . it was pleasant but not laugh out loud funny . pierce brosnan again proves , as he did in `` remington steele '' that he is wonderful in this lighter type of film and much more interesting than he is in drama . it 's a shame his career did n't go in this direction as he 's very relaxed and charming . moore was less successful ; part of this was the uptight career woman she was playing - this cliché has just gotten too tired . this is a good rental . i 'm not exactly sure why this type of film is made for theaters . if it was n't for the presence of moore and brosnan , this could easily have been a lifetime movie .		5		0
i know it 's just a dumb , predictable , formulaic romantic comedy , but i feel the urge to nitpick at the tennis aspects nevertheless : 1 . bettany wins the match in the 3rd round and then plays ... in the quarterfinals ! whatever happened to the 4th round ? did he get a bye for being english ? there is a draw in every grand slam tournament , not a 64 one , hence seven matches to play . is it too much to ask to have the barest minimum of realism in a hollywood movie ? ... 2 . bettany plays his semi-finale match on some crappy . this never happens , not even when it rains for days - especially not when a local player is in the semis ! 3 . the men 's semi-finale match was played around the same time as dunst 's semi-finale . this also can not happen - unless it rains for days . yet there was no rain . 4 . after bettany predictably wins his semi-finale match , he goes to the locker room and finds a dozen male tennis pros there . what exactly are they all doing there at such a late stage in the tournament ? after all , it 's not the 1st round anymore . apart from the singles , there are only the men 's doubles and the odd guy playing mixed . bettany should have found himself almost alone in the changing room , or at the most surrounded by agents , masseurs and organizers , not other players . 5 . dunst supposedly plays her first wimbledon . that would make her 16 or 17 . dunst can not pass off as that young . i ca n't remember the last time a female player debuted as late as this 20 + dunst they gave us . or are they implying she 's 17 ? that would make her underage , putting bettany in a bit of a spot . all top female talents play their first slams as early as when they 're 16 or 17 , some even earlier . there is no such thing as a super-talented u.s. gal reaching the on her first try - at the age of 20 + . 6 . cgi rallies do not in any way reflect what actually happens on a real tennis court . the second match point in the finale is like a cgi star wars version of tennis : utterly laughable . yet another point , in the same match , was supposed to have a successful lob , but the ball was n't high enough to lob a midget in a wheelchair , let alone a 6-foot pro ; nevertheless , bettany just apathetically watches it fly by him , doing nothing to smash it into the opponent 's half . i understand the need to make the film exciting , but creating tennis rallies is not the way to go - unless you think that only morons watch your movies . 7 . any pro veteran who needs a teenage lolita to give him tips on how to a player 's serve has to be an idiot . and , finally ... 8 . love does not win you grand slam finales . 9 . google `` 100 prettiest '' . halfway through this watchable movie i was thinking : `` it ca n't be that cheesy ... he 's not actually going to win the title ... ? '' but yes : the movie is that predictable - and that corny . the washed up 30something player , whom everyone forgot about , falls in lurve with a u.s. lolita , and this inspires him to go all the way . sam neill 's u.s. accent is in shambles . there is not enough chemistry between dunst and bettany . tommy haas , who was mentioned at one point , should have been cast . he is far better-looking than bettany and they would n't have needed to cover up for bettany 's crappy technique by all of his shots . plus : anyone can act .		5		0
right out of the gate , i will freely admit that kate beckinsale looks absolutely fabulous in this movie , and she almost carries the whole thing by herself . plus , the art direction and sound design and cinematography are all top notch . however , the problem is the script and the story that the movie tries to tell . the script lacks any warmth or empathy and turns the movie into a cold , sterile exercise in attitude and pyrotechnics . the plot revolves around an ongoing secret race war between vampires and werewolves . but the whole movie seems set in a world where human beings barely exist . after the initial shootout in the train station , you never actually see another ` normal ' human being aside from speedman 's character and his doctor friend . and speedman is n't really ` normal ' , either - he 's the genetic link between vamps and wolves . this gives the movie an airless , detached feel , with nothing to ground it in believability or reality . this was certainly a deliberate choice , but it has the unintended consequence of making the war irrelevant to my human perspective and concerns . look at the matrix films for a contrast - sure , there are superhuman fantasy forces on display in ` the matrix ' , but you never lose contact or identification with the very human heroes contending with those forces . similarly , except for the fact that the beautiful and sexy heroine is a vampire , the viewer is given no real reason to care which side should ultimately win the war . the werewolves are brutal , savage , and merciless ; the vampires are decadent , self-involved , and fey , with their ranks divided by internal power struggles and treachery . neither side is at all appealing except for the juvenile desire to identify with the biggest bad - * ss in the schoolyard . the so-called ` romeo and juliet ' elements to the film which the promoters try to emphasize , and which supposedly drives the moral center of the film is barely there - it 's a ` bad hemingway ' version of a romance . as far as i can see , we are supposed to realize that the vampire `` death dealer '' loves the human male because she does n't kill him . there is practically no interaction between the two ` romantic leads ' until the very end of the movie . they are a couple because the movie asserts that they are a couple destined to be together , but we never see any compelling reason -lrb- or evidence -rrb- why this should be the case . and it really grates that the vampires get shredded so easily by the werewolves . i thought the vamps were supposed to be winning this war ? what 's the point of being a vampire if all you can do is survive long drops off a fourth story roof ? again , the movie looks great ; if the story driving it had been even half as good , ` underworld ' might have been the big movie of summer 2003 .		5		0
wealthy hunter tom newcliffe -lrb- calvin lockhart -rrb- invites 5 people to his hi tech estate . he knows one of them is a werewolf -- but he 's not sure which one . when they all arrive he wo n't let them leave . the next three nights will all have a full moon ... and he expects to figure out who the werewolf is then . hardly an original idea -- anybody ever read agatha christie 's `` ten little indians '' ? also why exactly does newcliffe want to kill a werewolf ? it 's never made clear . this movies has tons of things wrong with it -- there 's a long unnecessary car chase at the beginning ; lockhart overacts to an embarrassing degree ; there 's plenty of painfully obvious day for night shooting ; with a few exceptions all the characters are obnoxious ; dinner sequences go on forever ; peter cushing has a laughable accent and the `` werewolf '' itself is just a big dog with extra fur stuck on ! also it 's just painfully dull . violence and gore is virtually nonexistent -lrb- for the pg rating -rrb- and there 's not even a transformation scene ! what saves this from being totally unwatchable is some good acting by cushing , charles gray and marlene clark and a `` werewolf break '' towards the end of the film . the audience is given 30 seconds to figure out who the werewolf is ! still that 's not enough to make you sit through this . a 5 all the way .		5		0
a nicely sanitized version of the real chris gardner story and it plays with an odd lifelessness , even though will smith , along with his charming little son , gives it his amiable best . the poverty laden underbelly of the u.s. , for once , is graphically depicted and that was a plus . but the pursuit of happiness , as promised by thomas jefferson ends up , as it always does , in the corporate . the depiction of the marriage was too thin to have any impact , it was as if the script writers did not know what to do with this end of the plot so the gorgeous and capable thandie newton was given short shrift as a miserable little shrew who marches off quickly , sans son , for a better life . there are many shots of the studly , will heading across streets and up hills at a very graceful loping gallop . many shots of him tucking his son into bed in various depressing hostels and cheap motels . some touching moments between father and child played quite beautifully . but the whole of it is like a deceptive box of chocolates , all glistening paper and satin bows and inside all you get are these cheap chocolates and not the belgians you expected . disappointing . 5 out of 10 .		5		0
comedies of this kind is depending on one thing . their actors . since hollywood learned the genre in the 30s , the basics have been about being down to earth . it 's funnier that way . here we meet the oh so typical , oh so funny and oh so boring new jersey couple , which during their weekly night out without the children , for unlucky reasons is taken for who has taken something from the mob . and some parts of new york is destroyed because of this . maybe that 's the reason why it does n't really function . you should n't be overacting , which they are n't , but you should n't neither be . that 's perhaps the case here , unfortunately .		5		0
john mctiernan and bruce willis return for die hard with a vengeance and frankly one is ultimately disappointed with what the final result was . the movie this time finds john mcclane -lrb- bruce willis -rrb- and a shop owner named zeus -lrb- samuel l. jackson -rrb- both joining forces to fight off simon -lrb- jeremy irons -rrb- the brother of hans , the villain of part 1 . the action this time finds willis and jackson driving around the city and looking and answering phones and what not , before coming up with a that saves the day . die hard 2 was n't very believable but by comparison to # 3 it 's the most realistic movie ever made . the problem is just how long the movie is , it follows the same repetitive path and the story lacks any form of plot . worst of all is just how uninspired it all feels , it 's as if mctiernan did n't know what to do with the story and so he just turns it into a long action sequence . problem is i lost interest half way through and the only redeeming factor is willis and jackson 's chemistry . -lrb- they were way better in pulp fiction . -rrb- * * out of 4 - -lrb- fair -rrb-		5		0
** spoilers ** disjointed crime thriller that has to do with the biblical four horsemen of the apocalypse coming back on earth for the great unveiling that will usher the world into the dreaded end of times . at least this is what chicago police detective aidan breslin , dennis quaid , feels will happen when the final one riding the either gray or black up in town . something like the movie `` se7en '' with four , not seven , headaches to worry about we have some religious lunatic running around town murdering people in order to create the perfect conditions for the four horsemen to fulfill the biblical prophecy of their coming . det. breslin the only cop in the city of chicago with a degree in dentistry is called on the case when a of teeth is found by an old woodcutter that , as it was determined , belonged to a recent murder victim . as det breslin and his partner stingray , clifton collins jr , investigate the bizarre case they happen to come upon a number of new victims who turned out to be connected to the missing teeth ! breslin gets his first clue with the confession of one of the murder victim 's adopted daughter kristen , ziyi zhang , who admits to him that she not only murdered her step mom 's soon to be born son , an obvious case of sibling rivalry gone over the top , but her step-mom as well ! it 's while she 's behind bars and being interrogated by det breslin that kristen gets him convinced that the four horsemen are coming and the murders that he 's now investigating are positive proof of that ! *** spoiler alert *** it takes a while to figure out just what all this * t is leading up to until we get to see what a rotten dad det. breslin is to his two sons alex & sean , loy taylor pucci & liam james , as well as his indifference towards his late wife karen . never having time for his kids in being married to his job as a cop breslin estrangement from them had warped his already very unbalanced mind . as for his late wife karen left her to die , of terminal cancer , almost along , with only alex & sean at her side , in the hospice ward while he was at work on a case that could well have waited . with the canadian town of winnipeg subbing , together with its -20 to -30 degree temperatures , for chicago the bitter cold weather conditions made it almost impossible for the movie 's outdoor scenes to last more then a few minutes . you can actually see that happening in an emotional scene with actors dennis quaid and ziyi zhan where their tears literally froze on their faces !		5		0
george zucco plays a double role in this low budget vampire film . dr. lloyd clayton , a kindly physician , has killed his twin brother , the satanist elwyn clayton , claiming self defense . but elwyn 's occult activities in life have made it so that he returns as a vampire after his death , seeking revenge on his brother and committing various attacks and murders along the way . a local busybody who is thought insane is the only one who seems to know the truth . but when elwyn attacks his niece gayle , lloyd and gayle 's fiancé seek to put this evil to rest for good . i think one of the best parts of this movie is the introductory scene , with a ghostly face , burning papers and a great atmosphere . not that this is a bad movie-it 's not . it is a fairly entertaining , if mediocre , vampire film that has a few original elements . george zucco plays the dual role very convincingly , such that he really could be different actors playing each role . as elwyn , he is ominous and menacing and both his expressions and the use of lighting in those scenes brings this out . he is much softer and kindly as lloyd . but there are some problems with this movie . some of the dialog is just too corny , a larger budget might have been helpful in set creation and the film does n't move very quickly , making its slightly over an hour run time seem a lot longer . not a bad watching if you like this genre , but do n't expect too much from it .		5		0
stallone 's first effort in over a decade is made -lrb- somewhat -rrb- notable only by the 60-something 's presence . here he 's jimmy bobo , a colorless , humorless hit man partnering with a somehow less likable good-guy cop -lrb- sung kang -rrb- to stay alive and avenge a fellow hit man 's death . `` bullet to the head '' , titled in the tradition of `` snakes on a plane '' and `` hobo with a shotgun '' , has a certain '80s action feel to it . with uninspired , unimaginative filmography , the film looks like it takes place within a radius . and one struggles to conceive of where the $ budget went . sometimes you have to remind yourself that you 're watching a 2013 theatrical release and not an 11 o'clock movie on basic cable . not that that 's always a terrible thing . if a film starring a rapidly aging action star does n't have nostalgia going for it , it 's in deep trouble . watching stallone kick ass again is actually enjoyable , though not as enjoyable as it should be for all of its axe-wielding wonder . the weak link is not stallone , though . nor is it kang . it is keegan -lrb- jason momoa -rrb- . his character is never properly fleshed out , his motivations made clear . instead he is presented as some mystical being , made of evil and honor , and his overtaking of his bosses at the climax is contrived . another 10 minutes or so of screen time would have solved a lot of the problems with `` bullet to the head '' , but it would have also created a whole other problem in making the film too long for all but the stallone diehards to bear .		5		0
granted . i 'm not a fan of long winded tales , and even less of the old west , but dang . django unchained was too damn long . it truly should 've been his next vol . 1 one year , and vol . 2 the next ; i would 've loved , needed , the intermission . o.k. trying not to start off in the wrong cowboy boot ... i did like this movie , and especially loved christoph waltz and his amazing character , dr. king -lrb- huh . -rrb- schultz . surprisingly , the star and title character , django -lrb- and jamie fox 's performance -rrb- was so incidental to schultz , it 's a wonder why he was cast . oh , that 's right ; samuel l. jackson was too old and needed to play the `` old black role . '' in normal tarantino mode , the movie starts one way and even advertises that premise , and then switches gear even before the movie 's half over . there are the typical long-winded dialogue scenes that , mercifully , do n't go on as long as his inglourious basterds or death proof shots did . there is the excessive gore and -lrb- way too loud -rrb- soundtrack -- which happens to be his worst one , to date . and there is the quick zoom-ins that remind people that tarantino loves those old grindhouse films . get past all that , like i did , and i did enjoy the journey of the enormously smart and quick-witted bounty hunter , schultz . oh , i guess , and his `` the 'd ' is silent '' sidekick , django . picture it : the old west . slaves have n't been freed and what is the deal with films this year ? sorry . where was i ? slave django is acquired by dr. schultz in order to find three unwise men and after becoming fond of each other , the movie switches to the retrieval of django 's wife . blood , tears , gore , comedy , revenge and bullets are all tarantino trademarks and you 'll get an abundance here . watch this for some quick wit , some slave owner 's just deserts and overall , the awesome christoph waltz .		5		0
the story of a young man who goes home and ends up confronting the monster that killed his father has some really great pieces in it . the opening sequence when the young boy becomes frightened of the shadows in his room , only to be calmed when the light reveals there is nothing to fear before the return to darkness changes things again is wonderful . there are several pieces like that through out the film that make you wonder what if ... the problem here is that the film is too long . there is too much time wandering the house , too many seemingly meaningless walks ... this film screams for a shortening of the slow spots . some may say it builds tension i say it builds this movie been cut by twenty minutes it would have been great . as it stands now its just okay and should be seen only on cable . -lrb- though it is worth seeing there -rrb-		5		0
about 250 years in the future , ex-soldier korben dallas -lrb- willis -rrb- is working as a taxi driver when a woman comes crashing through his roof . it turns out that this woman , leeloo -lrb- jovovich -rrb- is actually the fifth element , a supreme being who , when joined with four ancient sacred stones representing wind , fire , water and earth , can fight evil . which is lucky , since evil is coming their way in the form of a big pulsating planet , assisted by the impossibly rich tycoon zorg -lrb- oldman -rrb- , who is trying to locate the four stones so that evil can prevail . after teaming up with a priest named father vito cornelius -lrb- holm -rrb- to find the stones , they travel to another planet on behalf of the federation of the united states , where they meet up with various alien life forms who want to help or harm them , and their most frightening encounter of all , radio dj ruby rhod . -lrb- tucker -rrb- truthfully , i am conflicted when it comes to my ultimate outlook on this film . visually , it was completely captivating . the set designs , -lrb- layers of air traffic in the streets of new york , going up hundreds of stories , a floating central park -rrb- the costumes -lrb- gaultier , with his usual s & m - looking couture -rrb- and the colorful hair and makeup were fantastic . a lot of the contraptions -lrb- a mask that instantly does your makeup , a cigarette machine that dispenses cigarettes with increasingly longer filters for those who are trying to quit smoking -rrb- were clever and entertaining , and the overall style of the film was impressive . there were certainly some things that were really odd to me that do n't really warrant explanation , i still scratched my head about , -lrb- like what was the deal with gary oldman sounding exactly like billy bob thornton > -rrb- but ultimately chalked up to eccentricity . there was n't even anything universally wrong with the script ; i thought that it was a very basic , but fun story , and i liked the fact that notorious badass willis was n't so much living up to his reputation until we approached the end of the film . unfortunately , i became more and more irritated with some of the `` humor '' -lrb- mostly slapstick type things ; people saying , `` do you mean , a bomb ?! '' and the like ... i think i heard `` '' at least thirty times throughout the film -rrb- that was being presented . after viewing the film , i discovered that besson had actually written this screenplay when he was in high school , something that is slightly impressive , but actually explains a lot in terms of the goofiness , i think . the other major irritant was chris tucker . i completely understand that his character was supposed to be way out there -lrb- kind of a cross between prince and grace jones -rrb- but i think that the weird costumes , hair and mannerisms could have sufficed . instead i had flashbacks to sitting in the theater watching `` star wars : episode i '' and literally wanting to get up and hit something after listening to jar-jar binks screech and prattle on . tucker 's high-pitched voice and utter lack of charm did not win any points with me , and if anything , he made the film lose at least one point on my ratings scale . other than the aforementioned things , there was n't a whole lot to dislike about `` the fifth element '' but there was n't really anything to get excited about either . if this film did n't have the obnoxious chris tucker in it , i would consider it to be a great popcorn flick . instead , even while just mentally flashing back to some of his scenes , i begin to feel like a drill is nearing my ear . however , because the film was fairly enjoyable other than his scenes , i give it a 5/10 . -- shelly		5		0
i expected a non-stop gore-fest , but -lrb- thankfully -rrb- the gore was reasonably limited and confined to a small portion of the movie . on the other hand , roth seems to have given in to his producers ... or paid too much attention to the results of the advance screenings , it 's hard to tell which . the film is much too tidy and works too hard to dull the effects of the gore by tempering it with a sense of poetic justice . the skanky addicts who lure the victims towards their horrible and lingering deaths ? do n't worry ... we 'll run them -lrb- all three -rrb- over on the way home through town . the sadistic dutch businessman ? no problem ... we 'll have a chance to slit his throat during a chance encounter in a public restroom . offended and sickened by the twisted american businessman ? never fear ... he 'll be in he first torture chamber you escape to -lrb- after he 's thoughtfully turned his handgun over to you -rrb- . and so forth and so on ... all in all , the exact opposite of the `` saw '' movies .		5		0
once in a while i write a review and give it a whimsical , title , not necessarily very funny , then feel a little abashed for having done it . i think the last one may have been , `` oh , garcon -- ketchup , please ? '' you see what i mean . but then i see a a movie with a generic title like this -- `` edge of darkness '' -- and begin to wonder if i should n't try making my fortune by writing titles for movies . i can certainly do better than `` edge of darkness '' -- or similar real ones like `` the guns of darkness '' or `` another dawn '' or `` the man between '' or `` sense and sensibility '' or `` henry iv : part ii . '' ca n't they be more precise or lyrical ? or what , then , did the hand of the potter shake ? `` the edge of darkness '' follows a rather standard pattern . some terrible outrage is committed against a guy who represents goodness and is full of an awesome strength and power of will , somebody like arnold schwarzenegger . the hero throws away the rule book . -lrb- often he must hand over his shield and piece . -rrb- it takes him the movie to track down the evil doers and exact revenge . `` the punisher '' can stand as exemplar . here , mel gibson is a boston police officer whose daughter is killed by an industrial organization manufacturing nuclear bombs for terrorists or for use by a sinister cabal within the us government . gibson 's daughter , having discovered this , is offed in order to silence her . gibson receives some computer disks posthumously from his daughter , in which she spills the beans , and gibson floods out with rage . he follows the prescribed trajectory . he beats hell out of suspects , shoots others , frames some , and everybody ends up mincemeat . the action scenes are well staged . one in particular stands out when , without warning , a pretty young woman is exiting gibson 's parked car and another vehicle slams into the open door , removing it along with the girl 's body . wham ! there is also a mean pleasure to be derived from seeing gibson shoot people one after the other when we know they are guilty -- of something or other , even if just looking mean . and , man , these miscreants look mean . oh , they 're not or anything . they 're neatly groomed and dressed . but they do n't smile or make jokes or have pet dogs or families . -lrb- that would just confuse things . -rrb- a special award should be given to damien young as senator pine , who is just fine . he 's a suave and supercilious aristo , who brings a good deal to the role . mel gibson struggles with his new england accent but turns in as decent a job as usual . at the end he walks off into the clear white light with his daughter . it 's just another action movie with upper-echelon conspiratorial overtones that , for all we know , may be justified . it makes me wonder what the novel was like .		5		0
hulk is poorly directed . i know it . you know it . ang lee knows it . however , while the direction nearly destroys the film , the performances of eric bana , jennifer connelly , and nick nolte are the saviors of the film . bana is great as the ferocious green brute , catching every emotion that is required playing the most complex character in the marvel universe ... well the punisher 's up there too , but whatever . connelly as betty ross is a good move , and the oscar winner does not mess up . she is extremely likable as the love interest of bruce banner , more likable then kirsten dunst 's mary jane watson , katie holmes ' rachel dawes , or kate bosworth 's lois lane . nick nolte as the father to bruce -lrb- simply credited as the greatest credit ever : father -rrb- is bone chilling and creepy . he plays a wonderful david banner in this film , and he becomes a classic villain in the film -lrb- no spoilers here -rrb- . what really drags this film down is the cheesy music , crappy direction , and crappier writing . be forewarned that the hulk will not appear until about 45 minutes into the film , and before he appears , you 'll feel extremely bored . in spider-man , you only had to wait about 7 minutes for peter to get his powers , then about another 20 until he became spider-man . daredevil is already born in the beginning of the film , and the fantastic four are created within minutes of the film 's commencement . hulk is a waste of time for the average moviegoer unless one is a comic lover or an action lover , because the action is pretty good . i liked the scenes where hulk races away from the military , especially the ones in the desert . bana and connelly have great chemistry in the film , but sadly the terrible writing and direction , not to mention poor decision making overshadow this and a chilling performance from nick nolte . 6/10 -- spy		6		1
rock hudson deserves credit for stretching himself and taking on this unflattering role , far from the matinée-idol roles movie audiences were used to seeing him in , but the movie itself is a mixed bag . i 've always been a champion of john frankenheimer , and i think just about every movie he 's made is underrated -lrb- even `` the manchurian candidate , '' now considered a classic , was underrated at the time -rrb- , but `` seconds '' is one of his weaker efforts . i liked the sterling black and white cinematography , always one of the greatest assets in any frankenheimer film , but i just did n't feel that the movie itself held together as well as some of frankenheimer 's efforts . part of this is due to hudson , who , though one admires his effort , was simply too limited an actor to pull a role like this off . but much of the blame lies with frankenheimer himself , who was just `` off '' on this one . grade : b -		6		1
gary fleder 's film ` things to do in denver when you 're dead ' is a slick , stylised and violent thriller , complete with a very pretty girl -lrb- gabrielle anwar -rrb- and a seriously cool title . it 's mindless entertainment , in some ways not so dissimilar from the later ` ocean 's eleven ' -lrb- in which star andy garcia also appeared -rrb- , although rather darker in tone . in fact , the mixture of crime caper and tragedy does n't completely work , it 's hard to really care about the characters when they play it straight , while it 's not 100 per cent sheer fun either . in it 's defence , it 's definitely one notch up from the average gangster movie in terms of originality and style ; but only the one .		6		1
would n't you just like to see stuff burning for two hours . well , your wish is ron howard 's command and the firefighting sequences in this movie are terrific and look uncannily realistic . as for the story , it is only mildly interesting . kurt russell as one of the rival brothers mccaffrey does his most accomplished acting in nearly all of his career . it 's weird to think that this is the same man who made such bombs as graceland , soldier and executive decision , although that one was still pretty entertaining . same goes for the other half , william baldwin . fair game , anyone . it 's weird to think that one little movie could pretty much ruin his whole career , except the bad press the baldwin bros. have always been subject to . baldwin does come off as annoying , sometimes whiny and jennifer jason leigh gives a surprisingly dull performance as his love interest . the supporting cast is a director 's dream . we got robert de niro , donald sutherland and the very underrated j. t. walsh who plays smarm as easy as breathing . sadly , they do n't add much to the proceedings . donald sutherland does have one big moment where he enlightens us about the attraction of fire to both firefighter and arsonist . oh , did i forget to mention that . there is an arson on the loose and sutherland plays sort of a mad scientist -lrb- if you consider arson a science -rrb- and de niro plays the interrogator who knows just how to push sutherland 's buttons . fun , but ultimately seen many times before . de niro even looks like he did n't bother to shower for his 5 minute cameo . so , we come back to the attraction - the flames . they are pretty , pretty dangerous and give the actors a chance to do something they probably enjoy , smashing stuff - who would n't ? ron howard would change gears dramatically a few years later and become the respected director with something on his mind . maybe he did have something on his mind when he made backdraft but maybe it burned out .		6		1
one of those high-concept suspense thrillers that falls apart the second you start analyzing its plot , `` wait until dark '' goes around the world and back again in order to set up its premise -- blind woman being stalked by criminal thugs -- and then sits back and lets the actors do all of the work . and , luckily for this movie 's creators , the actors deliver . audrey hepburn makes this a much better movie than it has any right being , and alan arkin delivers a weird but effective performance as the off-kilter psycho who comes after her for some heroin he believes is stashed in her apartment . the film gives away its stage origins -- most of the action is confined to hepburn 's apartment , and director terence young does n't do a lot to give his movie a cinematic quality . but hepburn and arkin make this worth watching , and some moments toward the end do succeed in generating some truly nail-biting suspense . grade : b -		6		1
by no means am i saying that sci-fi movies have to be no that only make for entertaining flicks instead of evoking some interesting thoughts . some of the most interesting genre films -lrb- `` blade runner '' , `` 2001 : a space odyssey '' -rrb- are very philosophical and thought provoking . `` primer '' is definitely one step too far , though . it 's totally . if you have n't got a phd in physics you 'll hardly even get the basic premise , let alone all the confusion that ensues in the last third of the movie . the movie addresses people who love to figure out what 's going on and then watch the whole thing again and again until they get it . that means `` primer '' will find its cult audience , but everyone else will be left in the dark about what the hell is going on . with the budgetary restrictions director/writer shane carruth created a well-acted sci-fi flick unlike any other other . at the end of the day the movie remains a complicated thought experiment , leaving many things unexplained and vague . if it 's your thing to analyze a movie until it finally makes some sense , then go see `` primer '' . if you want actual entertainment and a story that can be followed , steer clear of this .		6		1
anger management : 6/10 : having a bad ending has torpedoed more than one film experience . the village 's twist was a groaner and the last scene of the last samurai knocked it down a rung or two . but in a comedy ? comedy is about laughter during the journey not the stories conclusion . none of our best comedies are known for their finales . meet the parents left with a comparative whimper , there 's something about mary 's ending is at best forgettable , and the bombastic over the top noise of say the blues brothers or caddyshack certainly was n't for everyone . -lrb- the exception to this rule is the wonderful stay puff marshmallow man payoff from ghostbusters -rrb- unlike thrillers or drama , comedy rarely invests enough in the plot to begin with for the ending to matter all that much . and an adam sandler comedy , lets face it , has less plot than most . -lrb- or at the very least the same plot and characters over and over again . sandler after all is the jim varney of long island nerds . -rrb- so to create a disaster this momentous you first need a good hour and change of comedy -lrb- rare enough esp . with mr. sandler on board -rrb- then you need an ending so stupendously bad it erases the laughter . welcome to anger management . first the good news . this movie has some quite funny bits . the bad news well lets start with the last 15 minutes or so absolutely feel good romantic awfulness with enough celebrity cameos that could sink the titanic , wipe out any goodwill one feels towards former mayor of new york and embarrass one to be a yankee fan . add on a plot device at the end that would n't be out of place in a deanna durbin film and let the jaw dropping awfulness commence . the last 15 minutes aside this movie has some really funny bits . even stupid stuff like sweaters for overweight cats worked for me . now that 's rare . the set-up is pure gold and the cast is great . if anything sandler is easily of the bunch . -lrb- luis guzman and john turturro 's characters needed their own movie and it was great seeing jack be jack again after that slog that was about schmidt . sandler knows how to do cruel . anger management was such a good concept and had such funny execution that it demanded a dark cruel outburst of energy at the end not this indescribably painful schmaltz .		6		1
yes man was a delight to watch . critics had panned it a bit , but unfairly , in my view . granted , it is formulaic , but it is a rom-com , and rom-coms have formulas . what made this film so great was the natural charm of zooey deschanel . she is beautiful , of course , but not in a `` '' kind of way . she has always had a freshness and honesty about her that makes her appealing . when i first saw her in `` almost famous , '' playing the older sister , i wished i had an older sister like that . when she played the girl lead in big trouble , she was quirky , but without any of the self-aware conceit that can often accompany quirky young female actors . i will be kind and avoid names , but perhaps you can picture in your mind some of the `` tragically hip '' and oh-so-cool young actresses who do quirk with a smirk . zooey deschanel has an innocence and a friendly quality that really make her shine , in the way a flower shines . jim carrey was also very good in this . he is who he is -- goofy and loopy and elastic . this was n't a `` serious role , '' such as truman show serious -- but was n't over the top like ace ventura . maybe he 's mellowed with age . i liked him as a wild kid , but like him even more now that he is a bit `` evened out . '' he is still hilarious -- but also a bit more human , and a bit more approachable . this movie runs through its rom-com paces , but each new scene , while a bit predictable , was nonetheless a pleasure . i felt uplifted by the end , and am very glad i went , even in the blizzard occurring where i am now staying . it was worth it !		6		1
possible spoilers for the one or two people in the world who have n't seen this one yet . ok - it 's ok . but i 'm not sure why the sequels . it 's not that good . i heard all sorts of ranting and raving about this film at one time . it took me several years to see it and maybe i just expected too much . it certainly is n't bad , but neither is it great . the special effects are ok but nothing to get excited about . especially the dinosaurs ... and that 's bad because this is a film about dinosaurs . if the dinos are n't real , the film wo n't seem real . they just do n't look that real . they somehow look and act mechanical . i thought the acting was pretty good throughout , but certainly nothing to write home about . overall , i was very disappointed with what i saw vs what i was expecting . i just do n't see what all the fuss was about .		6		1
if ever an actor was the only choice for a role , then this is it . morgan freeman has one of the most commanding presences of any actor in hollywood , and here he slips so effortlessly into the role of south african president nelson mandela that you have to blink twice to make sure you 're not watching archival footage of the man himself . it 's not an imitation so much as a habitation of the role . matt damon , too , does an excellent job , but he does it in a very different manner . whereas freeman tinkers with his preexisting screen persona in just the right way , damon completely casts his own aside , and i frequently forgot that i was watching one of the screen 's highest-paid actors . clint eastwood , an actor himself , has always excelled at coaxing quality performances from quality performers . in the early 1990s , nelson mandela was released following 27 years of incarceration . his first order of business as president , if this film is to be believed , was to ensure the world cup success of the south african rugby team . all other politics are bluntly dismissed as gratuitous international travel or distractions during a rugby game . by evoking a significant period in south african history -- the end of apartheid -- eastwood tries very hard to elevate ` invictus ' above the ranks of every other predictable underdog sporting story ever made , but a simple-minded approach to politics means that he never quite escapes the pack . in its final act , all matters of racism are swept aside for a world cup final that unfolds almost entirely in slow-motion , and , since the game 's outcome is never in any doubt , the sequence drags with corresponding sluggishness .		6		1
pleasantville starts out nicely with a good premise , but its plot gradually devolves into cliche themes that we 've seen countless times . by the end , it had completely lost my interest , and i was n't entirely paying attention . it 's a shame because it starts out fairly well . what better comparison than the utopian view of society in the 50s versus the issues of today ? but as i watched , i could n't help but feel that there was so much more the makers could have done to explore the world of pleasantville and contrast it with david 's and jennifer 's view of life . so much untapped potential . it was cute how there were no toilets and how the team could n't miss ; i think the movie could have delved a little deeper into other quirks . plus , i knew i should n't have let my mind wander , but i did ... i began to see more and more holes and unexplained , fuzzy elements . so is whether or not someone `` gains '' color more dependent on the person himself or the beholders of that person ? the movie would suggest the subject himself , but then again , how do inanimate objects then gain color ? if these citizens were so incapable of doing anything outside of the norm or outside of the script , then how could they function at any level once david and jennifer began to affect ? for example , how could they conduct a court trial if nothing had ever gone wrong before in pleasantville ? would n't the entire town plummet into chaos very soon ? all these questions detracted from the movie for me . i know i should n't have been so critical at a fantasy movie , but then again , the whole movie is about asking questions , right ? in the end , pleasantville is just another movie about challenging norms . a hero -lrb- s -rrb- enters a new environment , starts to make some noise , opens peoples ' eyes , causes a repressive counterstrike by the ruling conservatives , but then ultimately triumphs . hey , that 's exactly what happened in footloose ! throw in some odd , out-of-place , almost inappropriate references to racism and you 've got your typical `` what makes america '' movie . but this does touch on an aspect that does set this movie apart ; because they do not state exactly where pleasantville is located , the entire story happens in a political vacuum . is it in america at least ? presumably , but then again , the residents of pleasantville seem to be unaware of anything outside of town . this has an odd effect on many of the themes in the movie . for example , the whole issue of the paintings and the rock music are no longer issues of freedom of speech , since there is no bill of rights in this town . in a way , the issues are more basic and fundamental than typical `` what america is all about '' movies . so all in all , i was a little disappointed , but i still give it a 6/10 .		6		1
one has to pity barry pepper for his inauspicious jump into public consciousness as the lead hero of john travolta 's expensive tribute to the self-proclaimed genius of l. ron hubbard . in this , the first film i have seen him in since , he manages to give a convincing performance as the son of a mafioso who is trying to not follow in his father 's footsteps , but keeps getting knocked back by polite society . the character 's solution is to go back to what he knows . rallying for an assignment in his father 's enterprise , he finds himself in a fix when one of the men he trusts to help in his endeavour manages to misplace the cash . before this , we are told that money is going missing elsewhere in the organisation , giving us a little subplot that could have been interesting had it been fleshed out more . in the end , the film comes out like a lighter version of guy ritchie 's first few features that is missing the comedic element . vin deisel gets a reasonable turn as the philosophical hit-man who urges the lead to reconsider his new career choice . it 's a pity that the rest of the film was n't that well-developed , because deisel literally becomes a diamond in the rough here . dennis hopper and john malkovich give their standard performances as the elder statesmen of the organisation . malkovich in particular stands out in a surprise ending that makes watching the other eighty minutes worthwhile . the problem with knockaround guys is that it does n't feature enough to stand out from the rest of the proverbial crowd . the overall film is very formulaic and risk-free , which in the end hurts its chance of success . it really feels like the screenwriter was n't even trying . not that this absolutely would have saved the film , but it is still worth contemplating . i gave knockaround guys a seven out of ten . it 's not great , but it is entertaining , and uses its running time well . a box of popcorn and a few beers will make this ninety minutes rather pleasant .		6		1
of every of von triers projects i 've seen so far -lrb- riget , dancer in the dark , europa and idioterne -rrb- i could sense something happening ... until it slowly faded away to end up in ` just an ok ' movie . take dancer in the dark for instance . it 's interesting , acted superbly , but also overblown and out of proportions . it 's like that with breaking the waves . we follow the life of bess , a naive woman who marries the ` oilman ' jan. . when he 's seriously injured in an accident , bess believes that she can make him better , by sleeping with other men and telling him about it . what should be a story is turned into something silly when in the end , with bess dying , jan is getting back his strength . strength enough to his wife into the ocean , while bells from heaven -lrb- literally ! -rrb- sound for her ... i 'm sorry , but it 's just too much for me . von trier has overdone it again i 'm afraid ... 6/10 .		6		1
paul giamatti is awesome , simple as that . such a talented actor , i have yet to see him in a film that i have n't enjoyed . so of course win win is the next on the list on his impressive resume , the story was surprisingly quite complex but not difficult to keep track of which is the work of a great director . the character of jack is very reminiscent of giamatti 's character from storytelling , a guy somewhat down on his luck who just ca n't seem to get ahead or on top of things , of course these films are very different but the similarities are definitely there . amy ryan impressed me a lot , i 've never seen her in anything before but after seeing this i look forward to catching other films with her , she has a great presence in screen and her and giamatti work excellently together ... also worth mentioning is the always fantastic jeffrey tambor , equally as cool as giamatti . the only thing i thought did n't work was melanie lynskey , that woman has one of the sweetest faces and personalities , and seeing her playing a gold digging , backstabbing selfish mother just did n't work . i still love her though . a nice film that is not groundbreaking , but especially entertaining and pleasant to watch .		6		1
this a remake of the 1976 jodie foster vehicle and debatable which is the better . dr. tess coleman -lrb- jamie lee curtis -rrb- and her 15-year-old daughter , anna -lrb- lindsay lohan -rrb- , do n't see eye-to-eye on the usual things like clothes , music and each other 's taste in men . the widowed tess is reluctant to support anna 's musical aspirations and at the same time is not pleased that anna wo n't give her fiancé -lrb- mark harmon -rrb- a break . on a thursday evening , an enchanted chinese fortune cookie begins to cause some mayhem . friday morning , anna and tess wake up finding themselves inside the other 's body . they literally walk in each other 's shoes and gain some insight on the other 's viewpoint . a lively soundtrack features the likes of : forty foot echo , lash , ashlie simpson and miss lohan 's `` ultimate '' . note : annette bening was originally set to play tess coleman and i personally wish she did .		6		1
eagle eye is a decent once view about two strangers who are thrown into a mysterious cat and mouse game of constantly being watched by a mysterious woman who is controlling their every movie . if they fail to comply , she warns them that they will die . as they try to do each task , the woman pushes them into more increasingly situations . the premise of this could be george orwell 's 1984 comes to the big screen . eagle eye raises some serious questions about how much security is too much , and it is interesting to speculate on what could happen to someone if information is leaked into the wrong hands . the feelings that producer steven spielberg wanted to create , according to star shia labeouf was he wanted viewers to sense paranoia about how powerful today 's technology really is , and the amazing impact that it can have on our lives . the problem with eagle eye is that there are far too many running , chasing , jumping , and escape type sequences that go so fast from one scene to the next that you do n't really get the time to identity with the main characters . there is so much rush to everything that the viewer does not get the seriousness of the message that steven spielberg and director dj caruso wanted . there are many unanswered questions in this movie . with constant chases , explosions , and shia labeouf and michelle running from scene to scene , there is perhaps three minutes of film where they , or any of the other characters , are able to talk about solutions to the problems and issues of security . the film shows so much , as if a great story about security impacting people 's life 's can be made fantastic with action sequences and special effects . the problem is , in the course of all the special effects , the director and producers got so caught up in the chase drama that they forgot to settle down and tell a story . eagle eye is a good movie . however , it is a little too over the top to be great .		6		1
one of a trio of big-budget films that was intended to turn into a major producer after a run of successful -lrb- mostly -rrb- low-budget films but which instead all but destroyed the company , the mission is n't as irredeemably disastrous as revolution or as over-reaching as absolute beginners , but it 's still a disappointment despite its many admirable qualities . screenwriter robert bolt has an interesting , if obscure story to tell in the violent closure of the 18th century jesuit missions in paraguay as part of a territorial wrangle between spain and portugal , with the vatican going along with genocide to avoid political repercussions in europe while the priests in the missions try to protect their native guarani converts from the slave traders simply waiting for the church to withdraw its protection . robert bolt 's screenplay is strong , thanks to chris menges ' cinematography the film looks superb and ennio morricone 's score is one of his best . yet the film feels as if something is missing , possibly because it is : the work-in-progress version that won the palme d'or at cannes was reputedly nearly twice as long . what 's left tells the story and makes its points , but does n't really touch the heart or carry you along with more than academic interest . but perhaps worst of all , there 's a gaping hole where the heart of the mission should be in the form of robert de niro . he looks the part , learnt fencing , speaks spanish , yet for all that it 's a hollow shell of a performance hiding behind underplayed surface detail . on paper his character is easily the film 's most interesting , going from slave-trader to jesuit missionary only to find himself at odds with his vows when he needs to protect those he used to prey on with force , but de niro brings nothing to the part in a passive , detached and unemotional performance . his crisis of conscience and road to possible redemption seems no more torturous that trying to decide what to order from a disappointing restaurant menu . very much a supporting role , if it were n't for his reputation you 'd have no idea he 's supposed to be the great actor of his generation . as my stepfather -lrb- who is unaware of de niro 's reputation as the world 's greatest living actor -rrb- put it , `` he 's a bit of a block of wood , is n't he ? '' by contrast , jeremy irons , often a stuffy and mechanical performer , is something of a revelation here , taking the part to heart and abandoning all artifice to give a performance that draws its strength from its genuine humility and humanity . but the film 's best performance comes from ray mcanally as the papal representative sent ostensibly to judge the matter but in reality to provide a fig leaf for the church abandoning its converts only to find himself all too aware of the immorality of his actions and tormented by his inability to rebel against them . it 's a subtle portrait but a powerful one , and puts a genuinely human face on the film 's clash between the ideals of faith and the realities of the way of the world . in many ways it 's almost a pity that the film keeps him on the sidelines . -lrb- incidentally , one of the actors playing one of the jesuit missionaries , daniel berrigan , was himself a jesuit missionary who had been threatened with excommunication , while the portuguese villain of the piece is played by de niro 's real estate broker ! -rrb- the 2-disc dvd comes with an excellent one hour documentary about the making of the film from the days when they were n't . concentrating on the impact on the extras , much emphasis is placed on the possibly devastating cultural effects their involvement could have , only to be somewhat torpedoed by the telling detail at the end of the program that the entire tribe received only # 85,000 for a 's work -- apparently rather less than the fencing instructor de niro insisted be flown in to the location to teach him got -lrb- de niro fences for a grand total of 30 seconds in the film -rrb- .		6		1
thank you kevin smith , thank you from the bottom of our hearts . i am so glad that i saw clerks 2 while here in sacramento for training . i saw it alone of course and could not stop being entranced ! there were tons of gross parts which is excellent !!! jay and silent bob were excellent as always . of course , dante and his friend contemplate life like crazy , especially the other guy . the argument about lord of the rings vs. the star wars trilogy had me dying of laughter !!!! this movie will be considered one of the greatest movies of all time . i am glad i saw this . em ' coming kevin smith because you are a genius . the end		6		1
if you put a hundred monkeys in a room with a hundred typewriters , and gave them a hundred years to randomly tap out a `` star trek '' story , this movie is very close to what you 'd end up with . think about it : a big toilet paper tube threatens earth ; only the song of a humpback can stop it ; the crew must therefore sling themselves around the sun several times until they time-warp -lrb- ? -rrb- , and then they must walk around 1980s san fran for a while until they stumble on some whales . does n't it sound like monkeys wrote it ? i am , of course , being harsh . but i do think that this movie is and generally over-done . it bends over backwards to be funny and accessible , and ends up floating waaaay into the stratosphere . no doubt this movie pleased lots of general audiences , but i doubt that it singlehandedly produced many `` star trek '' fans , because it 's not particularly trek-like at all . complaints aside , this is a funny movie . not quite as funny as it likes to think , of course -lrb- the bouncy music during chekov 's rescue it so obviously comedic that it makes me ill to hear it ! -rrb- . but once the jokes wear off , the lack of dramatic content becomes pretty obvious . there 's a lot at stake , but the glib tone undermines any potential tension . not bad , but to me , actually the weakest of the original crew 's films . would fans still like this movie if it bombed , or would they rise up in arms to condemn its silliness ? i wonder ...		6		1
this was a pretty good film and good acting . do n't go in expecting a lot of action because you will be disappointed . the main criticism i have is that at times the movie is a little too slow and drags along . but for the most part , it was a good script . the movie takes place in 2 time periods . it jumps back and forth ; however , it made sense . it follows a couple , cindy and dean , and shows how they fell in love and then how they 've grown to dislike each other toward the end of their marriage . the major flaw is the movie never shows why cindy hates dean so much . we get the fact she 's falling out of love , but why ? is it because dean never got a good career like she did and drinks too much ? plus we learn they married for the wrong reasons . cindy finds herself pregnant and it could be dean 's or another guy 's , but they decide to marry any way . final verdict : it was good and shows a more realistic look at the downfall of a marriage . the acting was good . i recommend it if you want a really dramatic movie .		6		1
you almost always know you 're in trouble at the movies when the opening titles say `` inspired by a true story '' instead of `` based on a true story '' . this usually means that once a committee of hack screenwriters revises the story one-too-many times into slick hollywood pabulum , there are only a few traces of a credible true story left . `` the pursuit of happiness '' is `` inspired by '' the true story of chris gardner and how he went from being a failed salesman to a homeless person to a millionaire stock broker . and it is no exception to the above rule of `` inspired by '' vs. `` based on '' . gardner is played by will smith as a charming , driven , but down-on-his-luck salesman of bone density scanners . everyday , he goes out trying to sell his overpriced , unreliable products to doctors who do n't want them . and every night he comes home to his nagging , shrewish wife -lrb- thandie newton -- once a great beauty -- whose face seems now to be fixed in a permanent grimace -rrb- . eventually , on the way to another doctor 's office , he passes by the san francisco stock exchange and notices that everyone who works there seems happy and rich . inspired by their example , he applies for an internship at dean witter . when he tells his wife what he has done , she throws a fit and leaves the next day . it is at this point that the script starts to diverge from any reality that i can recognize . gardner has a son christopher -lrb- smith 's real-life son jaden -rrb- , who is the emotional core of gardner 's life and of this movie . when the gardners first split , there appears to be a looming fierce custody battle , with both parents acting more selfishly than in young christopher 's interest -lrb- something i recognize from my own childhood -rrb- , but in the next scene they come to an amicable agreement to let his father have sole custody . i suppose this would be fine except the tone of the battle keeps swinging back and forth from mean to friendly with seemingly nothing to trigger either mood shift , which tells me that screenwriter steve conrad -lrb- along with probably half a dozen other uncredited writers -rrb- did n't have the guts to portray divorce and custody fights for what they really are . back to the plot summary : by sheer gumption and by sprinting wherever he goes instead of walking , gardner manages to land the internship . in real-world , stalking a would-be employer and showing up for an interview in ratty clothes would probably be grounds for being barred from dean witter 's offices permanently . but in this hollywood confection , the head of hr -lrb- brian howe -rrb- and the ceo -lrb- james karen -rrb- are wowed by these things because they show just how motivated gardner is . i imagine their actual counterparts were a great deal more skeptical of gardner than what is portrayed in the movie . and despite being deeply impressed during that first interview , for the rest of the film they follow the lead of his trainer -lrb- dan wearing a toupee and acting like homer simpson 's worst nightmare -rrb- by blocking his potential contacts and treating him like a servant . the internship is unpaid , and eventually gardner winds up homeless . this is the only part of the movie that had any real emotional resonance for me . i could care less about his marriage or his work life , but gardner 's struggle to be a good father to his son while unable to provide anything for him is what lifts this film above true awfulness to mere mediocrity . the chemistry that the smiths have with each other is undeniable . and will smith -- like tom hanks -- is a good enough actor that he will likely get an oscar nomination every time he plays a role that is more serious than his usual fare . but `` the pursuit of happiness '' has little more than this going for it . in adapting gardner 's life to film , it seems to me that his story has been sterilized , simplified and watered down for the lowest common denominator . i would like to see hollywood make more gritty dramas that are `` based on '' true events rather than saccharine schlock like this that is merely `` inspired by '' them . 6 out of 10 .		6		1
blandly pleasant . that 's the most positive thing that can be said about you again . it 's the kind of movie that 's made to be played as an in-flight movie . safe , guaranteed to offend absolutely no one , and completely disposable . it 's a bit of a shame to have a cast this great given so little to work with . i 'm a huge kristen bell fan . she 's a very attractive , talented , and funny young actress that deserves much better than the last couple of movies she 's been in . odette yustman is another appealing young actress that 's waiting for a breakthrough role while starring in mostly middling movies . jaime lee curtis and sigourney weaver both have lists of good movies that stretch a mile long . it looks like from the special features that they all had a ball making you again , but it wo n't be going on the highlight reels for any of these women . the cast really is the only reason to check this out . the first half of the movie is as formulaic as anything you 've probably ever seen . the laughs are few and far between -lrb- i literally forgot that this was billed as a comedy , on occasion -rrb- . really , the only genuine laugh i found was due to a truly cringe-worthy rendition of `` every woman in the world '' by kyle bornheimer . the latter half of the movie was slightly more entertaining , but that 's not saying a whole lot . i actually feel like i 'm being pretty generous with my review because i like kristen bell so much . watch you again if you feel so inclined , but you probably wo n't remember much about it twenty minutes later .		6		1
-lrb- there are spoilers -rrb- put in charge of protecting the 423 star of rhodesia diamond sherlock holmes , basil rathbone , has his hands full in keeping it from those who are out to steal it off lady carstairs , its rightful owner . talking the express from london to holmes and his butterfingered sidekick dr. watson , nigel bruce , are in for a lot of surprises as well as murders on the `` express '' . the biggest surprise of all comes when you , and everyone on board , thinks that the movie is over and the killer had been apprehended . right from the start bodies start popping up all over the train with lady carstairs ' son roland , geoffrey steele , found dead in his compartment with a poison dart in his neck . it becomes apparent to holmes that the person who 's responsible for and later the trains baggage attendants , tom pilkington , murders is the elusive and almost impossible to identify colonel moran a protégé of the infamous and deceased professor moriarty . col. moran is a master jewel thief as well as master in disguise and is on-board to get his hands on the star of rhodesia . holmes who 's on to the colonel almost from the moment he steps on the train has to play it cool , and stupid , to show that he 's a clueless schmuck who has no idea what 's going on and even allows the diamond to be lifted off both him as well as roland and lady carstairs . we start to get some idea of what 's happening when we find out that moran has an accomplice on board with him the skeletal and creepy looking sands , skelton knaggs . sands earlier tried to push holmes off the speeding train but was stymied when he held on for dear life and made it back to his coach where a not all that on the ball dr. watson assumed that he just went out for a breath of fresh air . thinking that he has the real diamond , that holmes earlier switched on him , moran who shall remind nameless and faceless knocks off sands with his , that shoots poison darts , and then plans to check out at edinburgh not knowing that the scottish police , who were alerted by both holmes and scotland yard 's inspector lestrade -lrb- dennis hoey -rrb- , are there at the train station waiting to pick him up ! or are they ? a complete meltdown at the end of the movie with moran holmes as well as inspector lestrade playing musical chairs , on and off the train , with the audience and a totally befuddled dr watson trying to figure just what 's going on . when the big surprise finally hits us all it turns out to be is a big let down to the big build-up and wham bang conclusion that we were expecting it to be .		6		1
mike todd 's epic travelogue must have looked spectacular on huge screens of old , but on my 42 inch widescreen tv it was just okay . yes i 've seen the film before but only in pieces or cut up never had i seen it widescreen before , not had i seen in complete in at least a decade . . for the most part its an empty movie . only as fogg 's man servant has any real character since his is really the only person given anything to do.the film lurches from spectacle to spectacle with only the odd moment to get to know the characters . its one of those movies that really makes you go `` how did this win best picture ? '' . then again if i saw this in a theater with a huge screen i would have been floored ... or not . worth a look for the scenery and because it is a good far from great .		6		1
i just finished watching the chronicles of narnia : the lion , the witch and the wardrobe and i must say i came out feeling a bit let down . perhaps it has more to do with the fact that i 'm grown up and therefore expect more than a children 's story . and do n't get me wrong , it 's not a bad film - but like i said , it 's for children only -lrb- unlike the harry potter films which can be enjoyed by both children and adults , including yours truly -rrb- . and certain parts of the film reminded me too much of the lord of the rings , especially the battle sequences . even some of the creatures in this film seem to come straight out of the lord of the rings -lrb- this is n't all too surprising if you know that weta , the company that did the visual effects for the lord of the rings , also did it for this film -rrb- . overall , a 6 out of 10 . hopefully the next one will be more interesting and .		6		1
i 'll try not to give too much away , plot wise with this movie.but it basically involves the possibility of eternal life , -lrb- sort of -rrb- and there are some biblical parallels as well.there 's a lesson in here that contains the old cliché , `` be careful what you wish for `` you may get what you want -lrb- or thought you wanted -rrb- but nothing is for free , and there are movie is low budget and i do n't mean that as a some scenes , the movie actually works better as a , though i did n't like the movie as much as i thought i 'd had heard of it before , and had high expectations.i guess i though it would be more profound than it was.it has its moments , to be 's not boring by any means , but it just has less of an impact than i 's directed and written by guillermo del toro , who also directed hell boy , blade 2 and pan 's for `` cronos '' it certainly is unique with a different twist on an old me , cronos is a 6/10		6		1
odd mish mash of a movie about santa 's brother fred . when fred needs money his brother offers him the cash if he 'll come to the north pole and work for it . fred arrives just as kevin spacey as an efficiency expert arrives to see if santa can stay in business . an odd mix of low brow humor and clever bits that never quite comes together . there is a good movie rattling in there that occasionally shows its head , more toward the second half when the film finally finds a direction . there is much to like , in particular the depiction of sibling rivalry -lrb- the sibling anonymous meeting is hysterical -rrb- and the sense of family . a misfire to be certain , but a misfire that will be very welcome on cable , especially when you get to the good parts . -lrb- i want so much to tell you about the good jokes but i wo n't since i do n't want to spoil them -rrb- 6 out of 10 for the bits that work .		6		1
i got stepmom for julia robert 's performance , and i expected it to be pretty good . it did not fail me - it exceeded my expectations . this movie is beautiful . it 's the story of a husband and wife with two kids who have fallen out of love , and now the father is getting married to a new , younger woman . the mother of the kids does everything she can to make her children hate this woman who is going to very soon be a permanent part of their life . julia roberts indeed gives a fine performance as the fiancée of ed harris , the husband . she steals your heart in every scene she 's in as this young woman who is trying so hard to be exactly what those children want and need . and in the end , she 's searching for acceptance and love from them as much as they are from her . and then there 's susan sarandon , giving one of her best performances as the mother of the children who wants nothing more than to remove her children from the younger woman completely . sarandon 's character is horrible - one of the most awful and hateful people in modern movies . she , she 's , and for a long time , she finds every chance possible to turn her children against the other woman - yet you can not help but feel for her . as nasty as she is , you sympathize with this woman who is having to deal with her children being in the care of a younger , inexperienced woman who is living with her ex-husband . it 's impossible not to understand her character 's mourning and confusion . for the first time in her life , this woman is not the only mother in her children 's life . do n't be surprised if you cry - more than once . it 's that good , and that affecting . truly , this film is one of the better delights of the past few years . beautiful story , great performances , real emotions - 8/10 stars ! jay addison		6		1
it 's good but it 's a little too weird for my liking and i did n't like the ending . take some of both versions of willy & the chocolate factory , sprinkle with some magic and you have this very weird movie . dustin hoffman plays mr magorium , he 's over 200 years old , runs a toy emporium and it 's magic . hoffman plays the role well but i feel he was n't 1st pick -lrb- i still think robin williams or mike myers turned this down -rrb- . it does feel a bit like `` the cat in the hat '' . the use of colour is amazing . the films main issue is it 's very low on plot or storyline . magorium decides it 's his last day on earth and he gives the shop to his manager played pretty well by natalie portman . she just has the right kind of personality to be the shy girl who does n't quite believe in magic but is willing to be converted . i get the feeling she was n't 1st pick for her role either . the little boy playing eric is incredibly annoying . kids do n't like him because he 's weird . those ears and that haircut are n't helping him much either though . the guy playing the mutant is pretty good , he plays his role well enough to be convincing as an accountant who regains a more childlike inner self . the film looks great , the internals of the shop itself look wonderful . special effects are very well used but slightly over the top . the film feels a lot like both `` mary poppins '' & `` bedknobs & broomsticks '' in certain places . it 's definitely for the kids , adults are n't going to enjoy it all that much i feel . magorium does n't die as such but they have a funeral for him -lrb- never a great idea in a kids film , especially one with another 20 minutes of screen time to fill -rrb- . the eventual outcome of portman discovering her inner magic to revive the store is nothing if predictable . the film has n't really got an ending , it just peters out having run out of ideas . best left to the kids , it 'll do well on dvd i think .		6		1
a failed teacher and composer arrives to a french school for boys with problems in 1949 . he starts a choir and because of the power of music , the troubled boys do n't cause that much trouble anymore . this is a fairy-tale with some dark shadows . francois berléand as the tyrannic headmaster gives a rather good performance and so does gérard jugnot as the music teacher , but it mostly just surface anyway . some energy is to be find with grégory as the worst of the boys . no hope to be found there or ... ? rather conventional , but because of its french origin , it does n't become intolerable sentimental .		6		1
the artist is a well-made if not particularly involving homage to the silent films of the 1920s . the film itself looks beautiful , and makes interesting use of its lack of sound . however , the story lacks interest , and is as clichéd as the silent films it pays tribute to . the artist of the title is george valentin , a silent film star caught in a loveless marriage to a petulant starlet . he gives a jump start to the career of actress peppy miller after kissing her at a premiere . however , he soon finds his stardom dwarfed by hers after the debut of talkies and losing his fortune in the stock market collapse . the film is at its best when it plays with the whole concept of silent movies . the most impressive example is a dream sequence conveying the transition from silent to sound movies . valentin dreams that his word , previously filled with a silent movie soundtrack , now consumed by overly loud background sounds . this may be the first time in cinematic history in which a dog 's bark has conveyed the shift of an entire world . unfortunately , the film also suffers from one of the major flaws of silent films in general . because of the lack of dialogue , the artist ultimately has a simplistic story with largely one dimensional characters . to a large extent , the plot mimics that of a star is born , focusing on a famous performer ultimately surpassed by his protégé . as a result , the film is boring and predictable . furthermore , the film emulates the least interesting of the silent movies . rather than focusing on the more experimental films that characterized the early years of silent movies , such as the cabinet of dr. caligari and d. w. griffith 's work , it looks at the making of genre films . given that the artist , by its very nature , is aimed at film buffs with an extensive set of references , one would think they would give attention to more interesting films . still , the film 's cast does a lot , particularly given the lack of dialogue . penelope ann miller gives valentin 's harpy wife as much dimension as one can to such a one note character . john goodman is also good as a dictatorial producer .		6		1
it took peter sellers ten years to get being there made . this was the last great project of his life and he gives another great performance . the direction is by that wonderful technician hal ashby , one of the most talented editors hollywood produced . the skills of these two talented people make being there an important film . but the one-note forrest plot is a real disappointment . sellers is a mentally challenged gardener who has not stepped out of his masters house for decades . his only exposure to the outside world has been through television . when his master dies the simpleton is given eviction notice . he leaves the house and starts walking around town only to be involved in a minor car accident that brings him as a guest to the house of shirley maclaine and her dying millionaire husband . he impresses the husband -lrb- and in turn the us president -rrb- as a deep thinking , calm and very important man . when the president quotes him in a speech , he becomes a nationally known figure . the direction is good and sellers fits into the role like a glove . but the entire plot is implausible and there is no real humor . some viewers may find some real meaning in chauncey 's statements and i do n't mean to deride that viewpoint . but , i personally did n't and thought that the comedy of errors was based on one-note and continued for far too long . for a real dark comedy , watch punch-drunk love .		6		1
assuming that kidnapping is a common thing in central and south america , tony scott and his writers deliver an action movie far from being original , but rather striking thanks to , for instance , powerful scenes such as the interrogation in the car . the first part of the movie , which sets and develops the relationship , is a bit long -- particularly considering the viewer quite clearly knows what is going to happen -- , but leads to an ultra dynamic second part in form of a killing spree , with an excellent denzel washington , driven by his characters feeling of vengeance . on the whole , the film is enjoyable , however , on the form , two elements are questionable . first , although the cinematography is very dynamic -lrb- scott 's trademark -rrb- , it is sometimes too stylized and almost epileptic with those headache inducing short cuts , zooms and flashes . and second , the soundtrack mixes too many styles and therefore clearly lacks coherence . finally , and more generally , one could blame man on fire for being sometimes a but too cliché , and a bit too schmaltzy with grandiloquent violins , especially in the first part .		6		1
the film leaves many mixed feelings and emotions . first , the actors ' play is always very good . marty freeman , clint eastwood and of course hillary swank are in all senses excellent actors , their delivery is impeccably smooth and almost close to perfection . it is not the acting that spoils the mood , it is the very tedious tempo of the film . did you notice that sport films are mostly very boring ? the acute , high-pitched and up-tempo sport scenes are intermittent with impossibly slow and boring `` real life '' moments , when we see that they are also people , that they have their problems too and so on . but , dear me , i always wait till these boring moments will be replaced with those sharp sporty scenes again . the same with mdb - as a sport film , this is great , as anything else , it is slightly slowish and boring .		6		1
junebug is a bit of a doddle . not sure what it ' a aim was other than portraying the discomfort of clashing regionalism of northern outsider wife and southern in-laws . the acting is believable and the script is low-key and interesting . amy adams is a little over-the-top in her tom portrayal of a southern belle trying to get through the miseries of a broken relationship while pregnant . the is pretty jagged and displeasing , but ends up kind of flat and simplistic - almost spiteful as if to say - this is a cross-section of family life in the south . would n't be a good judge of that , but the movie is interesting in a melancholy way . it could 've used a little more humor perhaps . not too ground-breaking . maybe expectations were a little lofty . rent at your discretion .		6		1
the movie has the right intentions and the right talent is also definitely involved but yet it all does not work out as completely successful as it could had done . perhaps you can wonder if this movie was n't a little over-ambitious . it tries to put way too much into the movie and its filled with many different supernatural things and elements . it 's a bit incoherent and you can often wonder what the one thing has to do with the other . this is also because a lot of things within this movie remain unexplained . it works out good for the mystery and overall atmosphere of the movie but when none of it reach a satisfying enough conclusion it starts to work against the movie . the movie is in constant motion but it does n't feel like it 's progressing . at the start of the movie we know and understand just as much what happened as we do at the end of the movie . still its story and concept in particular is good enough to keep your intention till the end and director mark pellington is obviously a capable director , who knows to handle the genre but just did n't really knew to keep control of the movie its story . the story should had made some more choices but instead it decides to have a little bit of everything in the movie , with as a result that just nothing works out as well as it all could had done . it 's not really the type of movie you would normally expect to see richard gere in but he fits the part really well . it was good to not see him for a change in a middle-age chick flick , or overly moralistic themed and dramatic movie . it 's not necessarily a ` typical ' richard gere movie . he 's real good and convincing as the movie its likable main ` hero ' , you can also care about . the movie also features some fine other actors but they get more pushed to the background of the movie because of the reason that the movie its story is so with all kinds of things . all in all , yes it 's a watchable enough movie for when you 're bored or for on a rainy night but the movie is just not as great as it potentially really could had been . genre fans will probably still enjoy it best . 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/		6		1
it does not only look freezing cold , it is freezing cold . of course not as cold as the movie/story makes you believe it is , but still the temperatures are pretty out there -lrb- pun intended -rrb- . and in all that mess we have kate beckinsale . not only pretty but also a very good actress . though she does n't have to stretch her -lrb- acting -rrb- muscles that much here , she is still very good . the story is not that much of a secret -lrb- though i wo n't go into details -rrb- and you might be able to see the end coming a mile -lrb- or more -rrb- ahead . still the end is suspenseful enough and it all looks good -lrb- though a bit snowy and therefor not as clear at times , but that has to be that way -rrb- . a nice little thriller then , that can be watched for entertainment purposes !		6		1
black dynamite -lrb- michael jai white -rrb- is the baddest motherf **** r in town . when he 's not spreading his love amongst hordes of women -lrb- usually at the same time -rrb- , he 's kicking the ass of all the scum in town . after hearing about the murder of his brother over a drug deal , he stops at nothing to bring the guilty to justice . he joins forces with old friends bullhorn -lrb- byron minns -rrb- and cream corn -lrb- tommy davidson -rrb- and soon uncovers a massive conspiracy involving orphans , spiked malt liquor , and general deceitfulness by the man . as he goes deeper , he realises that the conspiracy may stretch higher than he could have possibly imagined . the genre is something of an easy target for a spoof - the films , though generally enjoyable , featured terrible acting , cheap cinematography and clunky scripts that are funny are their own . but black dynamite manages to pull off the trick of being funny while at the same time displaying a real love for the genre . it 's fun to pick out the homages , especially replaying an infamous scene from cult movie disco godfather -lrb- which if you have n't scene , please watch instantly -rrb- . it also has some killer one-liners , such as ` how many times have i told you not to call here and interrupt my kung-fu ? ' and ` i 'm declaring war against anyone who sells drugs in the community ' / ` but black dynamite , i sell drugs in the community ! ' . for all its positives , the film unfortunately runs out of steam near the end and seems to look like it 's clutching at straws and running out of jokes . however , i do hope for a sequel as there is a lot of promise here . www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com		6		1
the world is in crisis and suddenly north korea invades and occupies the us , with the help of russia for some reason . we follow some kids through all this as they hide in a cabin in the mountains . among them is a returning marine jed and his goofy looking younger brother josh . we learn that josh is n't one to follow advice but goes on his own to do stupid stuff , he does n't care about the team but only about himself . josh has a pretty girlfriend who like most of the population ends up in a a concentration camp . the escape by the kids catches the attention of main bad guy in charge of the area - captain cho . when jed and josh 's dad basically commits suicide by government after giving an encouraging speech , the kids decide not to turn themselves in . in a fast forward scene we learn that suddenly the kids become freedom fighters , with the help of the population and they manage somehow to travel freely from city to county without any problem . and indeed they start committing acts of terrorism against the new government while gaining the support of the locals . they call themselves the wolverines and are now chased by cho and his unit . at some point they meet up with two lone marines who are actually looking for them for help . they want to capture a communication device cho uses and keeps in a suitcase and to get it they all will mount a complex operation to infiltrate cho 's headquarters . i 'm not sure red dawn knows what it wants . it 's not adolescent enough for teens and it 's not mature enough for young adults . i sure would have liked to have seen more of the lovely isabel lucas and adrianne palicki . there are some very serious themes that could have been touched or focused on , but red dawn avoids that , too . casting is equally unconvincing . hemsworth is alright , peck is n't . how does any professional casting person figure these two would make believable brothers ? the girls are lovely but do n't do much . there 's a cruise kid in there as well for some reason . red dawn is a timely movie no doubt . america still is n't done with the business of interfering in the affairs of other nations . and the parallels between one powerful nation invading another one in fiction and reality are fairly evident . we briefly see some propaganda posters the north koreans have plastered all over the city and the rhetoric of the big shots all argue that invasion is for the good of the invaded . it 's the same everywhere and at all times . the powerful know what 's better for everyone and if the weak do n't accept voluntarily they will have to at gunpoint . the movie also gives a good perspective of what `` terrorism '' is , once you look at it from the side of the occupied country . and i 'm all for instilling some patriotism in kids , which is n't easy to do given all that is going on . red dawn could have been a strong movie had it been a bit more political . the forward scene of how the kids become freedom fighting `` terrorists '' deserved much more attention . the ending also looks a bit unfinished , they were going more for visual effect than for story . clearly the first-time director did n't know how to tell the story effectively enough . of course one could argue whether a story liked this is suited to be put into the world of young teens . this is one movie that should have been at least 15 minutes longer .		6		1
gamer is part ` the running man ' , part ` the truman show ' but on acid . plot is simple , prisoners can get a pardon if they can survive a game called ` slayers ' where they are controlled by someone using them as an avatar . gerard butler wants out ... thats it . if you are familiar with the duo behind the crank movies , you will know the kind of trippy movie you will get from the directors . visually the film is sound , there are some amazing shots and scenes , and it rumbles along at a nice pace . but the story is something that we have seen before , you could get any major sci-fi movie from the last ten years , and there will be some kind of resemblance to the film in this . are wasted , and other characters are predictable . only hall and sedgewick really stand out , especially the freaky dance routine at the end , so stupid , it 's actually the most genius part of the film . butler is okay , but anyone could have been the main character , the film will do no harm -lrb- or good -rrb- to his career . it 's an instantly forgettable movie , which is exciting in places .		6		1
so this is what the art of visual spectacle has come to . `` fantasia '' -lrb- 1940 -rrb- , `` black narcissus '' -lrb- 1947 -rrb- , `` 2001 '' -lrb- 1968 -rrb- , `` star wars '' -lrb- 1977 -rrb- - i could add many other examples - were all thrilling in various ways . `` the fifth element '' merely induces a headache . i 'll give besson his due for having the right kind of general idea . he wants to give us a guided tour of the rainbow , and he has a good deal of success , in individual scenes . he knows that computers alone wo n't do the trick . the perfect lighting combines with set and costume design to serve up some lovely : president 's purple throne room , the villain standing in a corridor of green , the blue soprano singing in front of a dark indigo arches framing a ripe blue planet . but it does n't always work . sometimes besson 's sense of colour fails him and the result is a mess . and apart from his sense of colour he has nothing to fall back on . the design of the future - it 's all visual design - is mostly a compendium of clichés , mixed in with a souped-up vision of the 1990s : an empty , hip , mtv flashiness . some of the computer images work , but most of them - the traffic shots in particular - feature the kind of cheesy rendering and animation that will forever be the industry standard , if we 're not careful . hipness - that 's besson 's guiding star . he does n't even care what his film looks like so long as he can convince us that he 's up-to-the-minute and with it . i suppose that 's why the action sequences are all underscored -lrb- and undercut -rrb- by ghastly for which , as is so often the case , eric serra is to blame . apart from the look and the feel there 's nothing to talk about without being overcome by deep weariness . the plot is n't hard to understand . at least , it 's as easy to understand on the first viewing as it 's ever going to get . it will never make any sense . here 's the central idea : once every five thousand years comes a great evil that will destroy all life , all life , if a magic ceremony is n't performed . the villain wants to stop the ceremony from being performed . the phrase `` obscure motivation '' does n't even begin to describe this situation . does the villain want to die ? no . is he acting in ignorance ? no . is there any way of making sense of his psychology ? no . if besson had been content with a simple high-wire act of implausibility , if he 'd been willing to let his central conceit rest unexplained , it might have worked . but he tries to explain things and makes matters worse . he ca n't even come up with some decent sophistry . watch the first confrontation between the priest and the villain while bearing in mind that both players know that the future of all life is at stake . the advanced student who can salvage some kind of point from this scene should then turn his attention to the mysterious actions performed by the priest -lrb- a different priest -rrb- in the opening scene . it 's no use : there 's no making sense of any of it . so far i 've been kind . it 's despicable as well as bad . anything so soulless , that tries so hard to be hip and cynical , has no right to attempt such blatant emotional manipulation at the end .		6		1

i know what you did last summer was made a year after scream , it even has the same writer . scream , though , was much better . this movie is n't anything new or interesting , it 's just like all the slasher movies that followed it , there is a group of good-looking teens that get hacked up one by one . ikwydls is one of the better ones though , as the acting is actually fairly good , there are one or two scenes of suspense and the killer is somewhat creepy . four teens hit a man . they dump his body . a year later they all start receiving threatening messages . julie -lrb- jennifer love hewitt -rrb- decides to find out who it is before the july 4th , the one year anniversary of their accident . for a teen slasher , this is ok . but their are a few things that kind of spoil what could have been a fairly decent movie . the deaths in this are n't very gory or interesting , which is needed for a slasher . the ending is really bad and of course , led way to the sequel , i still know , which was one of the worst movies ever made . the actors all did great jobs , especially sarah michelle gellar -lrb- who is involved in a 7 minute chase scene that is very intense -rrb- . 2 1/2 / 5 .		6		1
preston sturges after leaving paramount where he did his best work signed on to 20th century fox and his first film was unfaithfully your 's . starring rex harrison and linda darnell , it 's the story of an insanely jealous symphony conductor who hires private detective edgar kennedy to get dirt on his wife whom he suspects of carrying on with kurt kreuger his manager . some interesting items come to harrison 's attention and he 's driven out of his mind with jealousy . in that unfaithfully your 's is not unlike the ferenc molnar play the guardsman which alfred lunt and lynne fontanne did their one screen appearance with and the chocolate soldier where that plot was used for nelson eddy and rise stevens . during the concert while the music is playing and harrison conducting he imagines the many ways he can bring darnell and kreuger to their just desserts . in the end when it 's real he makes a holy hash of his attempts with a non-speaking sequence that is something that many of the silent screen comics like chaplin or keaton would have envied . when unfaithfully your 's was remade i 'm sure dudley moore did n't have the sophistication of rex harrison , but i 'm sure the broad comedy was something he could have done well . unfaithfully your 's was not up to what sturges did over at paramount . why he left is beyond me because seeing what he did there i 'm sure that the studio did not inhibit his comic genius . it 's still a pretty funny film and i recommend seeing it back to back to back with the guardsman and the chocolate soldier .		6		1
`` sweet bird of youth '' -lrb- 1962 -rrb- was directed by richard brooks who also wrote the screenplay based on one of the darkest and most pessimistic plays by tennessee williams . paul newman stars as chance wayne , handsome , charming , lusty , and fame-hungry young gigolo who returns to his southern home town after long stay in florida and hollywood where he tried to make a career as a movie star . he hoped to reconnect with two women he loved and left behind , his mother and his first love , heavenly finley . he hopes to make it this time because he brought with him a famous and once beautiful but now fading movie star with drinking problems , princess aka alexandra del lago -lrb- geraldine page -rrb- . she needs a companion , he needs her connections . once again , he will realize and bitterly admit that `` failure is a contagious disease '' . his mother died just before he returned and heavenly 's father , a local political boss -lrb- ed begley -rrb- , hates him and swears revenge for having broken his daughter 's heart . the film works thanks to the wonderful performances from page , begley , and breathtaking paul newman who looked like he was able to catch the sweet bird of youth and who gave an outstanding performance . brooks changed the play 's ending to give chance and heavenly hope for the better future but in the light of what we 've seen , the movie 's final feels like forced and unsatisfying .		6		1
left on the doorstep of an orphanage run by nuns , newborns moe , larry and curly grow up to uncharted levels of knuckle headed misadventure . now their childhood home may have to close due to financial difficulties . but larry , curly and moe , employed as the foster home 's inept maintenance men , are determined to come to the rescue . only the three stooges could become embroiled in an oddball murder plot - while stumbling into starring roles in a phenomenally successful tv reality show ... in my opinion , the farrellys have n't made a good movie in nearly thirteen years , and i 've never seen the original source material , so i had very low expectations of this . i was pleasantly surprised at just how child orientated it was , and how the farrellys stayed away from all the smutty humour that made them famous , they must have really loved the titular characters . the story is good , if a little childish , and the narrative is cleverly done by splitting the movie into three palatable episodes . as i 'm from the uk , i do n't know how this will fare over here , but i hope it does attract an audience . it 's great family fun , with lots of visual humour and immature moments that will make you laugh like a little kid .		6		1
i saw this movie in a high school class , and the teacher explained things along the way as we watched . the theme of the story is clear black monoliths are affecting humanity 's evolution over time , starting with our primate ancestors learning to use objects rather than just hands and feet to fight and hunt , and immediately jumping into where we start exploring outer space . the astronauts who reach the moon -lrb- remember the movie was made the year before we actually put men on it -rrb- see another monolith , but nothing evidently happens right away . then there is the falling-out between hal , the intelligent computer which runs the manned spaceship traveling further out into the solar system , and its human crew . it is unclear why this occurs , but the result is only one human crew member survives , and in the end ... presumably he evolves into something greater than human . whoever is behind the monoliths is never explained or hinted at . the special effects are spectacular for the era . the overall storyline , however , is not really deep . but this movie was made in the psychedelic era , so it works as a period piece .		6		1
i seem to be stuck in a rut of watching reasonably good supernatural thrillers lately . everytime i try to watch something else , i fall asleep . well , anyway ... ` the mothman prophecies ' is ` based on true events ' -lrb- these ` true events ' actually happened in 1967 , but i suppose they could n't set the film then , because richard gere would only have been a teenager . well , am i wrong ? in a similar vein to ` the dead zone ' , gere seems to be given the ability to perceive supernatural phenomenon as the result of a traumatic car accident , in which he loses his wife . again , who knows why ? on an impulse -lrb- unexplained -rrb- he drives from washington to richmond , and mysteriously finds himself in a small town in west virginia , which it would have been impossible for him to reach that quickly -lrb- again , never explained -rrb- . as soon as he gets there , he finds himself in the midst of every sort of peculiar goings-on you can imagine , but we can generalise and say that the center around people having mysterious and ominous messages of a huge like entity . this creature does peculiar things like talk to people for 60 minutes out of drain pipes , burn their eyes and ears , and talk in an annoying , high pitched , mostly indecipherable voice . whether all of these things were ` actual events ' in 1967 , i do n't know : the historical record suggests the writers may have embellished somewhat here . anyway there is n't much more that can be said without giving away important plot details . gere hangs around , determined to get to the bottom of things , and possibly avert a disaster . he consults a psychic investigator . he teams up with a policewoman who looks like the should be in ` fargo ' . ` mothman ' is n't too bad a supernatural thriller . it has two main faults , for my money : firstly , none of the characters are very interesting , complex or challenging , and secondly just a little too much is thrown in to the ` weird unexplained creepy things ' basket , without being really resolved . i know this is part of the film 's schtick , but for me it seemed a bit lazy . gives this one a bit over 6.0 .		6		1
director umberto lenzi who has been credited as starting the cannibal sub-genre with ` deep river savages ' -lrb- 1972 -rrb- effectively ended it with this nauseating and disturbing film . three friends -lrb- lorraine de selle , bryan redford and zora kerowa -rrb- head off to the jungles of south america as one of them attempts to prove for a college dissertation that cannibalism as an organised practice in modern society does not exist . while in the jungles they conveniently come across mike logan -lrb- giovanni lombardo radice credited as john morghen -rrb- and his friend joe -lrb- walter lloyd -rrb- , a pair of drug dealers from new york who have been forced to flea nyc . mike informs the three college students that he and his friend were savagely attacked by cannibals who killed a third member of his party in a horrific way . however , the truth is even more terrifying . bearing more than a passing resemblance to the theme of ruggero deodato 's ` cannibal holocaust ' -lrb- 1979 -rrb- this movie is yet another vile and revolting addition to the cannibal sub-genre which features the gory special effects wizardry of gianetto de rosi -lrb- who went on to provide make-up and special effects for movies such as ` the last emperor ' -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and rambo iii -lrb- 1988 -rrb- -rrb- and more than it 's fair share of now obligatory live animal slaughter . umberto lenzi succeeds in creating an air of cruelty that is unsurpassed by any other cannibal film , including ` cannibal holocaust ' . in this depraved gore-fest the viewer is ` treated ' to multiple castrations , beatings , rapes , brain eating and the now infamous scene . most of these sickening acts are cut from the uk release . ` cannibal ferox ' is a film that contains the same message as ` cannibal holocaust ' but rather than have the message as a main part of the film it is obscured by the barbarity that surrounds it and is only touched upon on brief occasions . ` cannibal ferox ' comes across far more as exploitation filmmaking than ` cannibal holocaust ' and is infinitely more repugnant . unfortunately the film is harmed by some unnecessary scenes in new york featuring a tragic 70 's disco soundtrack . luckily these scenes are brief -lrb- though the disco music features a lot -rrb- and the scenes in the jungle are given a dark and horrific atmosphere due to some good direction from lenzi , a half decent screenplay -lrb- something that is missing from many similar films -rrb- and some very haunting and sinister music . the acting , on the other hand , is pretty poor but good enough to immerse the viewer in this revolting and unsettling movie . ` cannibal ferox ' also features a brief appearance from robert kerman -lrb- aka porn star richard bolla -rrb- who also appeared in ` cannibal holocaust ' . ` cannibal ferox ' is certainly not for everyone and those who have not been fans of other italian cannibal films should probably avoid this movie completely . as i mentioned previously , the uk cut of this film is missing many scenes yet the film still remains stomach churning . however , to fully appreciate this movie it should be seen in its uncut form . i recommend ` cannibal ferox ' for gorehounds and fans of the cannibal sub-genre . while it obviously takes some influence from ` cannibal holocaust ' it remains different enough to have an appeal all of its own . my rating for ` cannibal ferox ' -- 6.5 / 10 .		6		1
a man on his death bed beckons logan to japan to see him for one last time . after his passing logan/wolverine finds himself caught up in a family and corporate power struggle and must survive as a normal man when is his power of regeneration is taken away . hugh jackman returns in the lead role , thankfully the change of setting injects some much needed freshness and dynamics into the genre . although you can spot that final twist a mile off mark bomback and scott frank 's screenplay rolls out an interesting action packed bodyguard yarn for the first half . -lrb- for fans -rrb- famke janssen reprises her jean grey role which is a nice touch and connects it to the previous x-men outings , it also gives room for some emotional scenes with jackman . director james mangold 's delivers some great action sequences from the start including ninjas , yes ninjas and yakuza going head to head with the wolverine . there 's guns , sword play and stabbings with some finely executed martial arts on display . however , the second half puts wolverine back in familiar superhero hero territory with a giant robotic samurai warrior and a toxic spitting woman viper played menacingly by svetlana khodchenkova . notable actors hiroyuki sanada and will yun lee appear . actress tao okamoto is logan 's love interest mariko and rila fukushima appears as yukio , logan 's ` bodyguard ' both are on fine form . there 's some good chemistry between jackman , okamoto and fukushima which gives some sentimental weight and comedy to this instalment . the excellent marco beltrami offers another great score which adds to the events highs and lows , the effects are what you 'd expect from this big budget but the wolverine is more impressively fulfilling with it 's physical action scene setups . overall it 's an entertaining ride , with a strong opening which - love it or hate it falls - into formulaic territory especially in the last act .		6		1
movies based on comic books or strips are usually for a certain audience only , but great directors and screenwriters are able to make this an experience , as we see in the case of latest batman saga . the green hornet , however , leaves a lot to be desired : the start is slow and protracted , shifts between scenes are not smooth , too much focus on state-of-the-art technology , lots of blunt humor , shallow relationships , repeated and clichéd action scenes . as for the cast , then only `` old guard '' -lrb- tom wilkinson , christoph waltz , edward james olmos -rrb- gives us relatively small , but somehow memorable performances ; seth rogen and jay chou are rather modest in their attempts -lrb- well , rogen can be a pleasant stand-up comedian , but he is rather bad movie actor -rrb- . britt reid is a strange character , developing from james bond into a tarantino 's usual character , especially visible in the huge action within the newspaper building . but still without touch . well , it kills your time if you like hare-brained action and tend to forget plausibility . otherwise , watch the batman movies -lrb- anew -rrb- .		6		1
peter hyam 's the musketeer is the third of four mediocre alexandre dumas adaptations from the last twenty years ; disney 's three musketeers , the man in the iron mask , this , and the count of monte cristo . according to renowned indie critic james berardinelli , hollywood is making dumas turn in his grave . iron mask was the best and monte cristo was the worst . this one has its ups and downs . as odd as it may sound , the musketeer has the personality of a martial arts picture . you can either choose to see this as a good thing or a bad thing . , it feels a little too over the top and artificial for a 17th century french epic . i may have mentioned once , that justin chambers is pretty bad in the lead , but he is no worse than oliver platt , kiefer sutherland , and charlie sheen in the disney version from ten years earlier . at least chambers tries to be serious , one could say that he makes sutherland , platt and sheen look like the three stooges in blue tunics . tim roth can play good villains , but his performance as the black cloaked , one eyed , captain of the guard , -lrb- previously portrayed by michael wincott , and christopher lee -rrb- is not terribly menacing . in truth , none of the acting is especially good . once again hyams acts as his own cinematographer , and he is a darn good one . although not necessarily oscar worthy , much of the film is well shot , especially the climax , during which he makes great use of fire to light the hectic fight scenes . as a swashbuckling film , the musketeer does its job , but not very well . it 's occasionally exciting , but often a little too unbelievable . my best recommendation for this kind of material would the mask of zorro .		6		1
when i saw the list of ten sexy vampire ladies , there was a name on there and a movie that i knew nothing about : mathilda may . now , this is one sexy hot vampire and she can suck the life force out of me any time . ms. may appears in the film nude and virtually speechless . what a treat for vampire lovers . i knew this was going to be bloody when i saw it was a golan and globus production . it had some gory scenes , all right . vampires take over london . the scientists speculate that all vampires came from space , as they have visited earth before . it is a combination horror and sci fi as they try to feat the invaders . wow ! what an ending !		6		1
a long lecture about things most sensible people already know -- mc donald 's brand imprinting begins at a very early age , working at an insensate level ; the food is real bad for you ; most americans do n't know a damn about nutrition ; obesity is overtaking smoking as the leading cause of preventable death -- redeemed by a ludicrous stunt -lrb- eating only mc donald 's for 30 straight days , whenever asked -rrb- to disprove a silly legal precedent -lrb- it can not be proved that mc donald 's is directly culpable in contributing to obesity -rrb- . increasingly , this becomes less about spurlock 's altruistic goal to change america 's self-destructively than a jackass spectacle wherein someone gets messed up real good for our pleasure . ask yourself : what is his purpose ? what does he hope to change ? other than a few cursory phone calls to a mc donald 's spokesperson to present himself as casualty to corporate seediness , it seems not much . after 22 days , his cholesterol has nearly doubled , he has gained 20 pounds , and doctors are advising him to dump the diet -- has he not proved his point ? apparently not , because he keeps on truckin ' , proving his initial thesis is n't nearly as important as grabbing the spotlight in his own production . a macho , stupid trick in a didactic , but topical documentary : i was n't surprised to read that one of spurlock 's favorite docs . is bowling for columbine . while he seems to possess moore 's flair for , he does n't have the instinct for sniffing out injustice , his subject 's weaknesses , or dogged fidelity to a cause that make moore such a hated figure and effective provocateur ; better luck next time , dude .		6		1
capture the gill man and bring him to florida as a tourist attraction , but unfortunately the creature wo n't be held for long ... sequel to the 1954 horror classic the creature from the black lagoon is admittedly a come-down from the original , but manages to be a fairly entertaining follow up . the biggest flaw with this film is the fact that the title monster loses some of the mystery that made it so frighteningly good in the first film , as our monster is literally placed for all to see . still , director jack arnold 's return proves to be helpful . the monster is still an impressive sight . b movie hero john agar heads a pretty decent cast with lori nelson as a likable female in distress . look for a young clint eastwood as a lab assistant . ** 1/2 out of ****		6		1
it 's not that it 's a bad movie , it 's that it is not good . guy comes into village with secret ; guy discovers secret ; guy pays for it . the secret is not even that interesting . fred durst from limp bizkit plays a secondary role in this one . he basically plays the wimp , which is funny enough . the problem with the film is that there is n't much information in it . i mean , i can hardly find anything to fill 10 lines of text with . it is not terribly boring , but it is boring . it is thrilling , but not enough . the subject barely makes sense and , considering it does , it is neither original nor very interesting . bottom line : not worth viewing .		6		1
elliot -lrb- henry thomas -rrb- gets no tiny brown dinosaur this time around . spielberg 's little brown monster has evolved to a full-grown george burns puppet , and has come back to visit earth again . only this time he 's into and helping lumberjacks get book - and film - deals . fire in the sky ... and a whole bunch of nonsense on the ground . the most fictional scene here , apart from the sequences , was the last scene with mike and travis . what a load of crap . that meeting never took place , certainly not in that manner . perhaps they had a beer together and laughed at the hoopla they 'd stirred with their baloney . of course , if this movie had been made without the `` based on a true story '' aspirations and pretense , it would have played out somewhat better . it is n't badly made . `` it seems to me this whole thing is a well-executed hoax , '' says detective garner . `` now , why would they do that ? '' asks the very naïve sheriff . perhaps because of the ensuing story that they sold to the tabloids ? the lucrative book deal ? this hollywood flick , which brought even more attention , fame , and dollars ? dunno , just guessing . travis had vanished without a trace for 5 days . agatha christie had been missing for more than twice that , at one point . unlike the lumberjack , she actually is a writer and she did n't follow her disappearance by publishing a goofy book about brown aliens , an abduction , and their bad breath . -lrb- was n't that why travis found the experience so traumatizing ? that spaceship looks very messy , muddy ; hardly surprising if they fail to wash their teeth regularly . -rrb- on the one hand , there 's the tons of scientific evidence which points toward the practical impossibility that an alien craft could/would ever reach earth -lrb- least of all one carrying even more versions of george burns , multiplied by 28 -rrb- . on the other hand , i 've got a hollywood flick , produced and written by money-grabbing , based on a book written by a hick . -lrb- with to lumberjacks whom i am not trying to insult here . -rrb- whom do i believe ? hmm . such a tough call to make . at least they had the decency not to portray the detective , basically the voice of reason here , as some putz , which would have been typical of a hollywood film .		6		1
wow . what an incredibly boring movie . i 've seen bad action movies before , especially bad martial arts movies . they cover up their lack of creativity by quickly edited fights that do n't really showcase anything except a couple of kicks . what we have here , is basically the same thing . far too many of the fights are over far too soon , and the most exciting sequence in the movie -- involving a bound jet li -- is near the beginning of the film , and the rest of the movie tries hard to catch up to it . perhaps the director did n't understand the script . perhaps the screenwriters did n't either , as mitchell kapner only gets story credit , even though he wrote the very funny `` the whole nine yards . '' maybe the studio did n't know what they wanted , or maybe they thought they 'd enhance everything digitally and do matrix-type business . bottom line , though , if you have a story as pointless as this one , and characters you ca n't figure out if you like or not until the films closing minutes -- you do n't have a film , you have a mess . this film was a mess . i liked the x-ray shots during some of the fight sequences , but if a filmmaker is going to do that , go all out . do n't use up your entire budget on just 3 shots . be an artist . 6/10 . the most clever thing about this film will always be its title .		6		1
uh-huh , i read that it is from the producers of underworld . i have watched the two underworld movies and they are not bad so i decided to watch this . there is nothing much i can say about this movie , it is just not bad but it is not that good too . in the movie , you get to see wackos running and transforming into wolves and i think the designer had done a good job . we now come to the plot which slightly make me sleepy . the story is about vivian is a wolf and she meets a charming man , aiden and falls in love with him . then you know the rest , the blah-blah romance . for the reward , you get to see some action with wolves chasing men . that is for the story . other than that , it is . . erm ... okay . bad or good , you decide for yourself , whether you like seeing wolves in action or not . if you have mood to watch this kind of sleepy and dark movies , then watch it . if you want to see big action , this will bore you as this is not underworld . dvd special features - that is sure boring , you only get some commentaries and languages selection . ca n't they at least put in some the making . it is not even worth to buy the dvd , if you want a dvd packed with special features . overall , you want to watch , you watch . but this is not underworld , you remember .		6		1
i was really astonished to found out that lindsay lohan had another romantic comedy movie with another cute guy -lrb- chris pine -rrb- . however my expectations did n't blend that well when i already peered the movie , just my luck did have the wits and plot of the story , but i think the direction needs more furnishing to do , so as well with the dialogue of the characters . the nature of the story as the title suggests all right , the characters : lindsay and chris is an adorable couple , so as well with their supporting characters . one thing that distracts my grading sensation with this movie is that some of their dialogue appears to be completely claptrap . i understand the first time ashley -lrb- lindsay -rrb- was arrested , but the whole arresting moment seems to be an idiotically lame portion of her arrest . another one when jake -lrb- chris -rrb- and ashley first dance , just because ashley found jake to be that cute and jake found ashley to be that exceedingly attractive then they kissed already ? for the profession and position of ashley i think she do n't have some sort of self-respect for hanging a minute with a guy she does n't even met before , it 's totally silly . i guess what i 'm trying to convey here dudes is that some part or maybe 40 % of the script are lousy , the direction come out to be poor . the characters are fine , especially lohan and i start to like chris for this is the first time i saw him . the wit may have brought an impact but the atmosphere of the acting did n't mixed goodly at all , it would have been better if mark waters directed this film . irrefutably honest , i still like the film , but i would rate it precisely as 6.5 out of 10 .		6		1
this was hailed by many horror fans as argento 's big return to form after many years . it is a serviceable murder mystery with a good goblin score , but i had three major problems with it . the first is that some of the sadistic and misogynistic violence is pretty repellent . the second is that the killer 's identity is fairly easy to guess , despite many obvious red herrings -lrb- a tip which is also a mild spoiler ... look for the worst actor in the film and you 'll be in the right direction -rrb- . and the third is that max von sydow 's presence clashes badly with the rest of the picture . when you have a scene of a woman 's head being repeatedly bashed against a wall until her teeth start to fall of - are n't you taking this a little too far argento ? - followed by a scene with von sydow talking calmly inside a car , something does n't feel quite right . -lrb- ** 1/2 -rrb-		6		1
now , granted , 2005 was not the best year for films and lately the family movies have been quite lame . but do you really think , to those who have seen the film , that this film deserves a 3.3 ? come on ! where is your sense of humor ? also , i watched this film when i was babysitting my cousins , we were just laughing our heads off because this film had some good gags in it . yes , it 's unrealistic , but what movies are ? some have to be a little unrealistic in order to deliver what we want . that 's the point of films , they help us escape reality and just enjoy ourselves for an hour and a half . so please , give this family comedy another chance and just let go and have fun ! 6/10		6		1
i finally saw bb and was expecting great things from the reviews it received last summer . while not a bad film , it did n't have that dynamite punch you expect from a film touted as a summer blockbuster . i found the very beginning confusing and it took me 40 minutes in till i started finding it entertaining and not boring . the beginning is from the title , it shows how bruce wayne trained to become a deadly fighter with a secret organization . he goes back to gothem after being gone years to rid the city of crime . rachel , the girl he had a crush on , is an assistant da and one of the few that has not been bought by the mob . the movie shows how bruce developed the bat suit , mobile , and weapons . and of course he must battle the surprise -lrb- though he was -rrb- villains at the end who want to destroy gotham with a chemical that makes people crazy . final verdict : ok , but not that great story you need to be a big hit . spiderman was much better with how they showed the hero obtaining super hero moves .		6		1
`` leviathan '' is yet another `` genetic creature movie '' , with a unionized mining crew counting down the remaining three days left before they will be able to return topside after a long period inside a large underwater installation . when two of the crew encounter an old russian vessel while working , one among them -lrb- daniel stern -rrb- brings an infection which causes a `` genetic alteration '' -lrb- essentially a flesh mutation -rrb- that starts to spread throughout the installation causing panic and bloodshed . director george p cosmatos -lrb- cobra -rrb- assembled quite a cast with peter weller as a geologist in charge of a bunch of blue collar miners -lrb- which includes the lovely amanda pays , wisecracking daniel stern always causing mischief , ernie hudson , michael carmine , lisa eilbacher and hector elizondo -rrb- and richard crenna as the doctor who understands several languages , his russian coming in very handy . the genetic mutations affecting certain crew members soon forms a large aquatic creature once they are dead , very similar to the alien lifeform in john carpenter 's the thing . to be honest , `` leviathan '' is just an assembly of clichés and ideas plucked from lots of other -- and better -- sci-fi horror films . the mining crew in `` leviathan '' is ripped right from ridley scott 's alien , and many of the underwater installation 's interiors are similar to the inside of the nostromo . i think the reason many will always seek `` leviathan '' out is because of the cast , but the characters are n't really that interesting , except maybe stern who plays a clown and ernie hudson as the vocal miner who aggressively voices his opinion even when it is n't wanted . the various creatures -lrb- one cool scene has a severed appendage cocooning a worm-like monster with sharp teeth -rrb- are disgusting . i can see why this movie is often compared to `` deep '' , directed by sean cunningham , as both deal with underwater facilities besieged by a giant creature dwindling the numbers of a crew preparing for departure . some special effects are memorable such as a hand having formed a mouth with teeth and the aforementioned worm attacking a crew member , burrowing into his chest . `` leviathan '' also features meg foster as the miners ' boss who seems to be delaying their departure because of fears that they will bring up to the surface something that will cause the company to plummet in the stock market , with weller and company plotting a different strategy to get out of their predicament .		6		1

after dispelling his friends concerns charley brewster finds that his new neighbour jerry is a vampire and he enlists peter vincent a las vegas magician and vampire expert to help him . the 80 's original was of its time , fright night -lrb- 2011 -rrb- successfully takes the offbeat humour of the original and reworks it into a solid piece of entertainment . five top calibre leads in a mediocre vampire remake somehow make it work . if it were any other actors it may have disappeared into a void . thankfully the talent of the leads in this eerie cheese-fest is the films strength . it 's not the ` why are they doing this ' but the ` its cool that they are doing it ' factor that 's alluring . anton yelchin , colin farrell , david tennant , toni collette and the lovely imogene poots -lrb- 28 weeks later -rrb- are all on form . although tennant is good he is n't as involved as he should be and he lacks the dynamics due to the screenplay that roddy mcdowall gave to the character . christopher mintz-plasse as ed is notable and delivers some funny moments . yelchin has some memorable scenes including a hilarious one-liner about a vampire hand . farrell steals the show as the perfect intense vampire . the effects are well executed , there are great sets , splendidly done is vincent 's apartment and the vegas setting gives the film a unique atmosphere and distinct look . craig gillespie has an eye for detail and the set pieces are slick and exciting . the script is average and the idea feels worn . that said , fright night has its funny creepy moments and is different enough from the original to be entertaining in its own right .		6		1
when a meteorite falls in a small town , a group of teenagers have to convince the authorities that a blob like alien is going around eating everything in its path . but then a bunch of government agents in bio-hazard suits show up to help contain this plague , leading the teens to have suspicions that more is going on than meets the eye . i enjoyed the original the blob movie . i thought it was entertaining and pretty good . and i 'm not usually a big fan of remakes . i usually find them pointless and would prefer to see something more original . but i have to say that i enjoyed this remake more than the original ... at least in most ways -lrb- what i did n't like was the back story behind the origins of the found that pointless and felt that it took away from some of the menace of the creature , as well as adding an annoying moral to the film , but i digress -rrb- . the strengths of this movie include the better pacing and some good special effects , including a lot of gore . now i do n't need gore to enjoy a horror movie but i also have no objections if it works well , as it does here . if you do n't want gore , stick with the original . i like the story -lrb- with the exception listed above -rrb- and i liked the action in this version . the characters were reasonably likable and the acting was decent , if not stellar . overall , this was a lot of fun and very entertaining . grab some popcorn , a date and just enjoy it .		6		1
i find it rather amusing that almost twenty years since this film was made i am now comparing it with vampire films that i have recently seen , despite the fact that back when it was released it pretty much set the benchmark for vampire movies . mind you vampire movies have always been popular , right back to the german silent classic nosferatu -lrb- which is based on dracula -rrb- . dracula itself pretty much defined the modern vampire genre , however many of the subsequent films that were based on that book all generated into slasher flicks when in the end the vampire is staked in his coffin . i guess anne rice set a new standard for vampires , and in my mind this moved on to the vampire : the roleplaying game which took the standard even further , to the point that i found it difficult to watch any vampire movies or read any vampire books because they simply did not meet or exceed that particular game . i still believe that vampire : the is a very well developed product , however it now being almost ten years since i last played it i has sort of lost interest in it . look , i did enjoy this film , but i do not think it is anywhere near as good as some people seem to think it is , and i feel that the end of the film actually drags it down . okay , it is the first in a series of books , however , like with books , one probably should not actually make a movie with a cliff hanger -lrb- unless of course it is lord of the rings -rrb- . pretty much , even a film , or a book , as a part of a series , should in itself be self contained . there are many other much better vampire films out there , and though i find the vampires interesting , in the end it simply bores me . despite the fact that this film stars brad pitt , i found that it did not have a clear movement , and was sort of a little baffled about the whole scene where louis is imprisoned in a crypt , and then goes on a rampage killing all of the vampires in paris , despite the fact that they were only following orders . this is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once , but i would probably leave it at that .		6		1
man on fire is a love story that develops into a , as biblical as the references that pepper its exposition . denzel washington 's lonely , alcoholic cousin of 's vincent -lrb- collateral -rrb- looks to right himself with some stock . in fact it is the relationship he builds with his charge -lrb- dakota fanning -rrb- that snaps him out of his cycle of neglect and self-abuse . the film has had weak press in this country -lrb- uk -rrb- . it has a sticky pudding 's stretch of sentimental bonding with fanning 's ` pita , followed by a second half of gratuitous vengeance set pieces -lrb- and an awkward scene we should see only as a dvd extra , where christopher walken tries to justify this fetishizing -rrb- . however , the filming and editing is quite excellent - beautiful , even - and for all it 's squalor , mexico city 's romance does glow from the screen . washington is heart-breakingly convincing as a man given a second chance , only to cross the moral boundaries without qualm when that redemption is manifestly denied him ; fanning is at least as good as you 'd expect -lrb- taken etc. -rrb- . there are loose ends and twists are inevitable but as the action becomes more frenetic on screen , so it becomes evermore developed internally by washington . performance of a just oscar-winner . 6/10		6		1
the monster club was the final installment in amicus studios portmanteau series and concerns -lrb- john carradine -rrb- a noted horror writer who runs into an elderly vampire named erasmus -lrb- vincent price -rrb- . erasmus duly takes his fill of the authors blood and after recognizing him becomes all apologetic and invites him to the monster club where he hopes chetwynd-hayes might garner some new ideas for a new the guest of erasmus , chetwynd-hayes is regaled with three stories of the macabre . story 1 : a young couple george and angela are hard up for cash , so they answer an advertisement in a newspaper looking for someone to help catalogue antiques in an old goes and meets the owner who as it turns out is a shadmock , kind of a vampire/werewolf hybrid , is scared of at first but soon settles in to her soon becomes friendly with the soft spoken and thoughtful employer but comes under increasing pressure form george to steal something from the house , and she decides to take advantage of an invitation to a ball with the shadmock 's family at the manor to fulfill her objective . story 2 : a vampire stalks the london underground is being chased by the a team of vampire hunters lead by pickering , -lrb- donald pleasance -rrb- . pickering uses the vampires son who unknowingly leads the right to his father . story 3 : stuart whitman plays sam an american movie director scouting the english countryside for the perfect location for his upcoming movie . he stumbles across a fog bound town full of ghouls where he befriends a -lrb- human and ghoul hybrid -rrb- and struggles with her help to make his escape from his living nightmare . review the shadmock story i found to be quite unique , its nice to have a different monster and this one was a rather a nice chap and i felt for his pain at the end , but it was definitely a missed opportunity , the idea of a monster ball i find intriguing , but ward obviously only used this as a means perhaps to save money on monster make-up . the second story is played for laughs which is a shame and is by far the least of the three stories.the ghoul story i found to be the best , and full of atmosphere with a nice twist at the end.the in between segments with price and carradine are poor and full of very bad monster make-up and annoyingly bad music -lrb- no really bad -rrb- , these two great horror legends were fine , considering the quality of script , but they deserved more . this is the kind of film i was raised on and for that reason and the people involved i really enjoyed it , sure its not the best from the esteemed amicus studio or baker , but for pure fun its hard to beat and i unreservedly give this a whopping 6/10 against my better judgement .		6		1
for reasons which do n't really matter -lrb- which is just as well , because they certainly do n't make sense , the tilson family -lrb- dad : dennis quaid , mum : sharon stone , daughter : pubescent kristen stewart , son : some kid -rrb- decide to get out of the city , and move out to the sticks where they buy a huge house for chump change because something bad happened and it got repossessed by the bank . they have obviously never seen a film before , because only bad things can happen in such circumstances , right ? and so they do , starting when stephen dorff , the son of the family who used to live there and newly released from jail -lrb- which should be another warning , right ? -rrb- arrives , talks them into hiring him , and things go pear shaped . big time . this film multiple clichés into a order , and flirts with the notion of having a supernatural element before dropping the idea . even if you have never seen a film before , this one is going to hold few surprises for you . it is arguable that it is worth watching for a relatively high profile cast sacrificing art for a paycheck , and for l'il kristen stewart sulking away like mad years before she was called upon to do the same thing in the twiglet movies . if you find yourself with an afternoon with nothing to do , and this comes up on tv -lrb- which it wo n't because of the bad language -rrb- , find a book instead .		6		1
there has been -- and probably will be for some time -- speculation about the end of this film and how it strayed from stephen king 's novella by the same name : the mist . there 's good and bad in equal measure , depending upon your stance on hollywood horror versus the literary kind . but let 's back-up and look at the beginning before we rush to the end ... equal parts supernatural thriller and science fiction yarn , the novella -lrb- published in 1985 in a short story collection entitled skeleton crew -rrb- was , well , phenomenal . it is the type of story most horror fans associate stephen king with . compartmentalized . freakishly different . plays on morality . just flat-out good writing . king did well back in the 70s and 80s , but he has floundered as a writer in recent years with his horribly bad from a buick 8 and the equally putrid dreamcatcher -lrb- which was made into a very unfortunate film starring morgan freeman -rrb- . what exactly happened to mr. king , i 'm not sure . he had n't had his brush with death -lrb- yet -rrb- and his earlier work sent the proverbial chills up my spine -lrb- most notably the excellent the shining and it -rrb- . regardless of past or more present works , mr. king did get lucky with the shawshank redemption in that he got frank darabont to write the screenplay and direct . the shawshank redemption has been labeled one of the top 100 films of all times by nearly every film critic in the world , and it is one of my top ten favorites . the transfer from book to film went exceptionally well , and this was in no small part thanks to darabont 's work . darabont did similarly nice work on the green mile , but it did n't quite reach the heights that shawshank did . but when i saw that was attached to this film , i leapt at the chance to watch it . needless to say -lrb- because of my cool acceptance rating -rrb- , i found the mist to be entertaining but sadly lacking in several areas . but let 's start with the good ... the creature effects . the combined work using cgi and stop animation was excellent . knb efx group as the special effects crew and doing the visual effects showed us some eerily nice work . the ominous cloud of mist was perfect enough to shroud any early identification of the creatures within it and the actors reacted to the mist just as you would expect . marcia gay harden -lrb- into the wild -rrb- stars as mrs. carmody , the bible-thumping , wielding , , christian hypocrite that we all enjoyed in the novella . i hated her in the novella and i hated her here , meaning that gay harden pulled off a very good performance . any further positives however -lrb- save one -rrb- , get blurred by the ridiculous nature of the scripted characters . too many times we get the ` shock ' effect simply for shock effect , rather than sticking with the compartmentalization of the situation -lrb- i.e. , people of differing backgrounds at each others ' throats in a supermarket during a crisis situation -rrb- . characters act as if they are surprised to see death and destruction after it has already been shown to them just a few hours before . people leap for weapons when a creature is nearby ready to skewer them . main actor thomas jane who plays david drayton could have been played by just about anyone , meaning that i did n't find his portrayal of this character memorable -lrb- whereas gay harden nailed her role -rrb- and the list goes on ... getting back to the ending -- and my final positive note -- i have to say that it was hampered somewhat by my enjoyment of the written word versus this visual medium . in the novella , mr. king leaves the ending fairly ambiguous . which i liked . i liked a lot . and here , in the film , that gets changed to a much more somber ending . although i liked the fact that darabont did n't sugarcoat the final act , i do think he could have kept king 's original ending and added a few more fans to his legions . but let 's make it perfectly clear that this ending is absolutely in-line with the true horror genre , which is why it got a rating from me .		6		1
gary grant dithers a lot , though less so than in `` arsenic and old lace . '' myrna loy is a sweetheart , as always . melvyn douglas is suave . they are good company for an hour and a half or so . sometimes it 's a little hard to buy : would a businessman really be so casual about purchases in an area he does n't know ? but it moves along at a sprightly pace . and it tells a story of america the way `` the best years of our lives '' tells another story : when we meet grant , loy , and their daughters , they are in a apartment in manhattan . they decide they need more space . so it 's off to the wilds -lrb- apparently they were wilds in those days -rrb- of connecticut and their very own house . this happens in the `` i love lucy '' series , too -- to the show 's determent . `` lucy '' is much more fun when the are living on at that impossible address on the upper east side than when they move to connecticut . that move signaled a change in what television was telling people was chic . in `` mr. blandings , '' we are never told that the city is still not a great place . but a house in the country is something one earns .		6		1
what a corny title . i love those strange , out-of-the-blue collection of letters and words . back then , these kind of titles were intimidating or even scary . now they are just goofy . and i collect these goofy movies , because they have a certain charm . x the unknown is a movie just like that . it 's a very straight-to-the-point movie about radioactive mud melting people . did n't see that one coming , did you ? the acting , effects and music all work for this movie . sure , it gets cliché at times or just dumb ; but like i said these kind of movies have a certain charm . so if you are a fan of movies in this genre , check it out . you wo n't be disappointed . on a side note : it was my first black-and-white movie of warner bros. 6 out of 10 stars .		6		1
`` in this city all is a story . '' much like any woody allen movie this movie has multiple story lines . a man trying to revisit his past in the city he grew up in . a newlywed couple having troubles during their honeymoon . a semi-retired opera producer trying to find the next big star and a man who gets what he wants , only to find out the phrase `` be careful what you wish for '' is true . there is n't much to say about this movie to convince you to watch or not watch . this is a woody allen movie and he has a built in audience already . on the other hand he also has a real style that turns people off and they wo n't watch because it is a woody allen movie . i thought this was ok and i am not a allen fan at all . i really liked his last movie -lrb- midnight in paris -rrb- but this one was more of his older style and more quirky and i just do n't like his style of humor . also just as a heads up half the movie is in italian with subtitles -lrb- in case that bothers you -rrb- . i thought the movie is ok but definitely woody 's style of comedy . overall , if you like woody allen you will like this movie , if not you may not . i give it a b - .		6		1
sherlock holmes is called in following a series of gruesome murders in which each victim has a finger cut off , and uncovers professor moriarty behind a sinister plot involving hypnotism and blackmail . a very enjoyable little sherlock holmes mystery , with a great script by bertram millhauser . rathbone is as searing as ever in his masterful portrayal of holmes , brooke is a charming femme fatale and daniell a terrific moriarty , both having appeared in smaller parts in previous entries in this series . there 's also a wonderful photographic effects sequence by john fulton when brooke hypnotises holmes . neill turns in a brisk , polished thriller , with wit and style to spare .		6		1
trainee priest , loses faith , says last rites to woman who gets knocked over , manages to get toby jones to send him on an exorcism course , meets anthony hopkins who is an exorcist , hopkins gets possessed . guess what happens next ... i saw this film just for the fact that hopkins could potentially be as maniacal as lecter in at least , hannibal mode , and whilst there are flashes of genius toward the end , the film as a whole is very slow and not very special at all . the trouble with the film is the main character , rather than having a lack of faith , seems to have a lack of happiness , as he spends the majority of the film maundering around the different locales . yes the guy has had his problems , but why choose that career path to begin with ? things get a little better when we are introduced to hopkins , and as one would expect , he 's the sarcastic kenobi to the other guys skywalker , an exorcist who can take a phone call during his rituals -lrb- which to be fair is a nice touch -rrb- . after the initial greeting , we are then treated to the old shock scares a few times -lrb- which do n't do the job -rrb- , and then hopkins fails his exorcism , starts to cry , stares at his refection -lrb- always a sign -rrb- , and then slaps a kid for no reason -lrb- a definite sign of demonic possession -rrb- . the film becomes worth watching , but we have had to endure 70 minutes of depression before this , so it 's a case of too little , too late . a shame really , because this could really have been something good , rather than an average horror movie for teens , disguised as a gothic ` true story ' .		6		1
this film has little acceptance , and that `` virus '' combines a good mix of `` frankenstein , '' `` alien '' and `` terminator '' , producing a cocktail of these three classics of science fiction . the film seems a mixture of several horror movies and sci-fi . the argument is interesting in its infancy and the development is entertaining , but it is very typical , predictable and compliant in their objectives . this is to see what character falls first and who survives , and is very easy to guess . i must emphasize that the special effects are far superior to those of very recent movies . the film is interesting performances of jamie lee curtis and donald sutherland are acceptable other performances are mediocre . it 's just an entertaining film that mixes several films , the only difference is that here the action takes on a boat .		6		1
mel gibson is an action hero who can act -lrb- as well as direct -rrb- . `` edge of darkness '' marks his return to the big screen , and i was not disappointed . the golden rule of hollywood nowadays is never ever trust the trailers , they might mislead you . the trailer for this movie is no exception , it made the film look like a standard shoot-em-up revenge . fear not , folks . `` edge of darkness '' is a great , solid , pure thriller . there is no overkill of action sequences and language , and absolutely no sexual distractions . it is well-balanced and very satisfying . i have n't seen the tv series yet , but this film makes me want to watch it . instead of a rampaging out for revenge it focuses more on the conspiracy around it , and the intelligence and intensity is packed all in in a tight squeeze . granted this is a drama thriller , but there are some violent moments , many of which that will make you startled . martin campbell directs with concentration , focus and intensity given the content he had to work with . this movie is a far cry from his action-laden bond and zorro films , and shows the mature , and thoughtful martin campbell . just like many reviewers pointed out before me , mel is back . he is a , cop , and he does not let personal tragedy get in his way of investigation . he 's a very good cop in a bad mood . having said that , mel gives us one of his most memorable performances and that is no easy feat . we believe , we feel for his character on the screen , and we root for him like the humans we are . the other cast members give gibson good support , especially ray winstone . he has newfound respect from me . the guy can act , and he does so in here brilliantly . danny huston is pretty sneaky but unpredictable with his role . in technical aspects , the cinematography is okay , the editing -lrb- by the king of movie editing stuart baird -rrb- is not rushed and excellently timed , and i have no qualms about howard shore 's music score . `` edge of darkness '' is a slow-paced , but solid and nonetheless gripping thriller that keeps you guessing until the end . i was floored , and i walked in with no expectations . what pushes us over the edge ? overall value : 8/10		6		1
if one made a better movie out of this one , this film would be the first 30 minutes of it . as it is , shyamalan stretches a good short story to almost 2 hrs and makes it worthwhile only with his excellent direction , a well-written script and memorable characters . just as in his previous film , `` the 6th sense '' , shyamalan demonstrates his ability to power-up his scenes with almost nothing at all - no crying , no shouting , no running around . some sequences in this film are very powerful , and the most powerful of them all is the one left out altogether : the train crash . calm moments are the most disconcerting . the characters seem pretty dull at first , willis just seems to stand around looking really confused most of the time . but the awakening to the fact that he is unbreakable , who would n't be ? jackson 's frail comics collector is strange and esoteric , bordering on crazy . shyamalan is a talented director and writer , and this movie is good . but i get the feeling that he rushed to make this film , and that the haste has crippled it somewhat . first of all , like i mentioned above , the entire movie felt like the first 30 minutes of something bigger , longer , better . maybe a part one in a trilogy or something . second , the nifty little details that were so abundant in `` 6th sense '' are almost completely forgotten or overlooked here . it 's as though shyamalan decided to shorten the process and cut some character development and some trivia . and the film suffers from it - it is not anywhere near as interesting as `` 6th sense '' . there 's a twist , too , but this one is not very surprising -lrb- especially if one has read any kind of super-hero comic at some point in life -rrb- , and seems a bit desperate . but what really sinks the ending are the completely unnecessary explanatory texts that appear , revealing what happened after the story ended for the viewer . i do n't understand the need for that kind of self-mockery . it does n't help the story , it does n't add anything interesting to the flow of the plot and it certainly feels like a desperate move or some unimaginable sort . i 'm not just talking about `` unbreakable '' here , i do n't understand the need for this in any film -lrb- except maybe true stories -rrb- . i really do n't think that shyamalan `` did it again '' , since the contrasts between `` 6th sense '' and `` unbreakable '' are very stark , and the quality of the former is far beyond that of the latter . but shyamalan is clearly a talent to be reckoned with . he just has to top his debut , which will be very , very difficult . a challenge , you might say .		6		1
i was not expecting any thing from this movie , but it turned out extremely well . really interesting and thrilling action heist movie . pretty enjoyable . should you see this movie ? yes , it will keep your attention and most of the action is believable . there is genuine balance and chemistry amongst the characters . the director did try something different by putting a twist in the middle of the movie instead of at the end . he gets points for that . he also gets points for the elaborate shoot out scene ; i applaud his choice of string instrument background music and lack of loud gun noises to give it a huge impact . if you are into heist movies , ensemble action flicks , westerns etc. , you will definitely enjoy this , but do not expect more than what it says on the box . a michael heist thriller with a pulse-pounding foot chase and some terrific stunt work offsetting its hackneyed plot and dialogue .		6		1
hard-luck case elizabeth hartman is not only blind but living with a monster of a mama -lrb- shelley winters , playing a , and winning a supporting oscar as `` rose-ann '' years before her tv role as roseanne 's grandma -rrb- . guy green directed and adapted the script from elizabeth kata 's book , and possibly made the hartman character too pathetic and unselfish -lrb- she 's like a sightless puppy , and seems to harbor little grudge against her mother for treating her like dirt or , worse , causing her blindness in the first place ; any sane person , blind or not , would rebel against this tyrant , though hartman eventually does -rrb- . sidney poitier 's role as the saintly stranger who takes an interest in hartman and wants to help is somewhat facetious ; we can see his attraction to her -lrb- she 's lovely when she giggles under a line of dialogue or when she 's right upfront in her thoughts -rrb- , yet he 's like a storybook prince , and it 's not a terribly convincing role as written . the film is an over-achiever , packing a lot of melodrama into its frame -- and striving to be edgy and controversial in the bargain -- but at the same time it is certainly poignant and touching . *** from ****		6		1
the movie is bizarrely ineffective and lacking in flair , like so many nowadays mainstream horror flicks as inept as this one ; though quite violent , it does n't really scare . in a sense , it has some qualities to be praised -- like the way it 's written , or some good sense in the directing , some form of almost mainstream and practical approach of a sensationalist subject . it has some common sense ; but no flair ... . i pretended not to notice its side of social awareness -- the perils of the youth 's dissolute life , the lsd , the debauchery of the workmen as a way of infection ... . it tries to be even a zombie movie , and the scene of the rabid , foaming workmen 's attack is deeply laughable , such rubbish ... . why does the geezer examine that blood sample ? did he use to examine each stain of blood he ever found ? i mean , it 's not like he ai n't my favorite movie physician , yet ... . anyway , it looks like he examined the blood because he already had inferred from mildred 's description that the blood was on the hands of a possibly rabid human . i drink your was , i think , nicely shot ; the makeup for the rabid fellows is bad . no genuine suspense , excitement and gusto whatsoever . ` death by hydrophobia is agony . '		6		1
there is a lot to like about this movie . the cinematography and direction are excellent -- so it 's a very pretty movie to watch . and there are elements of the script that are excellent . i particularly like how the story is slowly revealed through the letter of a possibly dead woman -lrb- you do n't find out for sure until the movie 's conclusion -rrb- as well as the way louis jourdan 's character is written . however , despite all these good elements , i had some serious problems with joan fontaine 's character that prevented this from being a great movie . while i know that there are many people who mistake infatuation with love -lrb- as fontaine 's certainly did -rrb- , you wonder just how stupid a character can be until you lose interest in what happens to her . joan plays a 19th century character that would probably be at home on a show like jerry springer or jenny jones in that no matter what common sense says , she still follows an idiotic dream that she will magically be swept away by a man who is a thorough jerk -- and has given no evidence he is anything else . so , for me , the whole first portion of the film was fine -- but , after she marries and raises a child and has a good home , it just did n't make any sense why she 'd leave all this for a pipe dream -- it just was n't very believable nor did i care much about anyone dumb enough to act that way . i 've just got ta have some respect for the character for me to feel any emotional attachment to the film . finally , it did seem absurd to have 31 year-old fontaine play a young teenager at the beginning of the film . this was highly reminiscent of the very unconvincing film the major and the minor where ginger rogers pretended to be a pubescent girl to hide out in a girls ' school .		6		1
riding across manhattan in a stretch limo in order to get a haircut , a 28-year-old billionaire asset manager -lrb- robert pattinson -rrb- has a day that devolves into an odyssey with a cast of characters that start to tear his world apart . we have director david cronenberg , one of the great directors of all time , and his trusty composer howard shore . so we are off to a good start before we even push play . but then it gets complicated . much of the film set in a limo , which makes for limited action beyond conversation . we get a variety of of capitalism , such as the idea that time is now a corporate asset , and money creates time rather than time making money . we are even told that capitalism is a specter , a direct reversal of karl marx 's famous line . todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter criticized the film and wrote , `` lifeless , stagey and lacking a palpable subversive pulse despite the ready opportunities offered by the material , this stillborn adaptation of don delillo 's novel initially will attract some robert pattinson fans but will be widely met with audience indifference . '' whether this is fair or not , it seems to be an apt prediction -- as of this writing -lrb- august 2013 -rrb- the film sits at 5.1 on imdb , which is pretty bad . if it is a masterpiece , the average viewer fails to see it as such .		6		1
a group of teenagers travel cross country on a road trip and decide to investigate an old urban legend out in the texas countryside . a legend about a certain sicko named `` dr. satan . '' they soon get much more than what they bargained for as they get `` invited '' to a local family 's halloween celebration . guess what happens next ? that 's right ! gore ! lots of it ! the film is not too inspired by originality , nor crafted for a mass audience - the film was held back from release for a good 3 or so years . despite all this it is a very well made horror film that is rob zombie 's tribute to what he loves most - a good movie scare-fest . zombie even said that this was largely inspired by the ` texas chainsaw massacre ' and in watching this film you 'll see that it is , in fact , very alike to the cult classic . a long dinner scene , hanging bodies , crazy hillbillies , and the like . however , rob zombie , who directs all of his band 's music videos , has a good visual style and despite the film 's unoriginality story-wise , he keeps things very interesting visually and musically . you know you 've see this type of stuff before , but it is n't exactly stale due to the direction and genre fans are bound to love it for just that . even the acting is above horror films with sid haig giving the best performance as a. . . clown ? psycho ? weirdo ? well , you decide . 6/10 rated r : graphic imagery and a lot of profanity		6		1
finally , adam sandler is rising up from the perpetual spiral of semi-interesting movies he has been riding for the past years . sure , the movie `` just go with it '' looks disturbingly similar to `` 50 first dates '' when you look on the cover , but they are two completely different movies altogether . the story told in `` just go with it '' is fairly sassy and hollywoodish ; a classical lovely story of sorts . danny -lrb- played by adam sandler -rrb- falls in love with palmer -lrb- played by brooklyn decker -rrb- . they go away to hawaii with danny 's assistant katherine -lrb- played by jennifer aniston -rrb- and his friend eddie -lrb- played by nick swardson -rrb- . and the story rolls as the little white lies escalate and grow larger and larger . i am not going on with more of the story here , but being a ` straight off the hollywood romantic comedy assembly line ' , then there is no surprise to how the movie ends . you know it straight from the minute the movie starts . but still , the movie is quite enjoyable . although stereotypical , then the story is a good one , and you quickly get into it . there are some really good characters in the movie , aside from the four main characters . i especially liked the plastic surgery enhanced people at the party in the beginning of the movie . they were hilarious , and drew lots of laughs . the location of the movie , in hawaii , really adds a romantic aspect to the movie , and it works out really , really well . you can almost feel the sand between your toes and feel the waves as they crash gently against your shins . thumbs up on making the feel of the movie stand out this much . there is a really good chemistry between aniston and sandler , and they really brought the story to life and they were in their aces in this movie . i was pleasantly surprised by this movie , as i had expected it to be another of sandler 's mass-produced half-funny comedies . so if you like romantic comedies and are a fan of either -lrb- or both -rrb- sandler or/and aniston , then `` just go with it '' is definitely worth checking out . the movie has some wonderful moments , it will make you laugh and it will make your heart all warm and fuzzy . thumbs up , and welcome back sandler ...		6		1
receiving mixed to positive reviews , but delivering a poor performance at the box office , `` seeking a friend of the end of the world '' is a film that talks about the strange subject manner of the 2012 apocalypse , while showing the affects being made on other people . despite the fact that this movie is sadly overrated and unimpressive . steve carell stars as a young man whose wife just recently left him , and now he 's suddenly alone , in the middle of the upcoming end of the world , where everyone 's life is at stake . while carell decides to say goodbye to a past lover before the world 's untimely conclusion , he runs into keira knightley as a spunky young woman hoping to see her family for the last time . so , they both set off to see the world for the last time , while keeping their promises of doing what they need to do before the world ends . but will a romance suddenly occur ? this movie is not terrible by any means imaginable , since this is way too unique of a movie for me to hate , but i also did n't love it , and i 'll explain why . while i will admit that director lorene scafaria does a rather decent job in directing and writing this movie , i was quite unimpressed by the direction this movie decided to take . steve carell and keira knightley both deliver fine performances , as usual , and i bought the fact that these two people would end up being good friends , but i sadly ca n't buy the fact that these two would become a couple . the rest of the supporting cast has plenty of familiar faces from rob huebel , rob corddry , melanie lynskey , patton oswalt , t.j. miller , and martin sheen , whom all sadly just stay in the back as extras , given nothing to say or do for the entire running time , while sheen on the other hand , delivers yet another satisfying performance in his long-time acting career . the tone feels bloated at times , some scenes can feel very distracting , and by the third act , i started to check my watch , due to bad pacing . before anyone starts to bring hate on this review , i will admit that this movie has some moments of heart , two good performances , and a unique script , but i just wish that this movie was handled more carefully . `` seeking a friend for the end of the world '' , in my review , `` seeking much more , but left to disappoint '' .		6		1
-lrb- spoilers -rrb- it 's very obvious though that paul hogan shoulda made one in the 90 's . he 's looking every bit his 65 . but the biggest change is that wife of his . except for her voice , i barely recognize her . and after all this time ... they have n't gotten married ? i liked the score on the second movie the best . but i was surprised to actually like this third movie . it 's pretty much the same ol dundee . so it was quite a refreshing feeling he 's still around to make us laugh . though obviously it wo n't win any awards , it was still a sweet addition to the series . 6/10 quality : 4/10 entertainment : 10/10 replayable : 10/10		6		1
there were so many reasons why i was ready not to like this movie . first of all , the original sam maguire trilogy was so recent , and were done very well and did so well also . i did not really feel the need to make this reboot at all , much less , too soon after the `` spider man 3 . '' i was also very leery about the choice of andrew garfield as peter parker/spider man . watching the trailers , i do not know what it was about garfield 's face and body build that did not seem right to be peter parker . anyway , the hype was still really building up , as evidenced by the grand first day showing today in almost 100 % of cinemas all over the country . of course , it was inevitable that my whole family will still go and watch ! as it began by telling peter parker 's high school life , you see that director marc webb was trying so hard to make it different from the first tobey maguire movie , and this can be noticed as the movie went along . the story of how peter was bitten by the was so far - fetched and unbelievable . the story of how gwen and peter became a couple was so rushed . the story of peter 's parents which was what i thought would be a main theme in this movie was hardly tackled in detail at all . andrew garfield painted a different peter parker than tobey maguire . garfield made the role his own by up the angst . i have to grant that andrew was a better dramatic actor than tobey . his scenes with veteran actors martin sheen and sally field -lrb- as uncle ben and aunt may -rrb- were heartfelt and sincere , as with his romantic scenes with emma stone -lrb- as gwen stacy -rrb- . however , he seems to become schizophrenic when he dons his spider man costume , as he becomes all too cocky for comfort . emma stone acted very well as gwen stacy . she was a much better love interest than kirsten dunst was as mj in the first movie . i guess it was because gwen was written to be smart and courageous , unlike mj who was nothing more than a mere damsel in distress . rhys ifans does an effective departure from his usual comedy roles to play the tragic dr. curt connors . it was just too bad that the story of his descent into lizard madness was too sudden to be affecting or logical . admittedly , there were so awesome-looking visual effects in this movie . the cartoony palette of the tobey version was replaced by a darker and more serious mood in this one , more fitting into the marvel canons . overall though , while the effort was there but the final impact of this film could eventually be forgettable . even the extra scene in the end credits hinting a second installment was predictable . after watching , all my three kids declared that they liked the tobey version than this . ultimately , we still remember the tobey maguire films too much for this film to take any serious roots into our memory . let 's see if the next installments will make a difference .		6		1
from director john carpenter -lrb- halloween , the thing -rrb- comes this interesting science-fiction romance with some good morals and moments . basically an alien crash lands in the united states -lrb- after hearing invitations from earth , and with this learning english -rrb- , and it ends up at the wisconsin house of young widow jenny hayden -lrb- raiders of the lost ark 's karen allen -rrb- . it is through photographs that the alien takes the appearance of jenny 's late husband , scott , and he is now known as starman -lrb- both played by oscar and golden globe nominated jeff bridges -rrb- . starman is now asking jenny to take him to the site of a meteor strike before the time is up , and he will die . it is ultimately a twisted romantic road movie . oh , and along the way , he uses his many magical alien balls to solve problems for himself , jenny and a few others , e.g. a dead deer , and they are being pursued by the army and science expert mark -lrb- the untouchables ' charles martin smith -rrb- . it was nominated the golden globe for best original score for jack nitzsche . good !		6		1
i never quite understood why the old pirates got so ticked off at the town . it was through their own bumbling that everything happened . then , of course , we have the old legend and the festival and people who ca n't see their hands in front of them -lrb- fog joke -rrb- . of course , most of us wake up every morning thinking that the pea soup stuff we see occasionally has as its consequence making the drive to work uncomfortable , even dangerous . we do n't know that eye patch and peg leg are in there working their many charms . i do n't mean to be harsh , but a good ghost story needs proper exposition to provide us with a palpable threat . the foundation is hokum and it just did n't work for me .		6		1
i enjoyed watching hatchet and found it to be a great horror film . it is about a crew of tourists that go on a boat ride of the haunted louisiana bayous , where they learn about the terrifying tale of local legend `` victor crowley '' a horribly disfigured man who was accidentally killed with a hatchet by the hands of his own father . the the boat sinks and the tourists find out that the story about victor crowley is real , the group tries desperately to escape the swamps quick as they can . i thought that i was quite a good horror movie , more like some of the older movies . i thought that the cast in the film were very good actors as well .		6		1
someone told me that this is worth trying , and the cast list looked appealing , so i decided to take their advice . basically evelyn couch -lrb- bafta and golden globe nominated kathy bates -rrb- is having difficulties with her marriage to husband ed -lrb- gailard sartain -rrb- , and no-one seems to be taking her seriously . then one day while in a nursing home visiting relatives , she meets ninny threadgoode -lrb- oscar , bafta and golden globe nominated jessica tandy -rrb- , an out going old woman , who over their time together tells her story of idgie threadgoode -lrb- mary stuart masterson -rrb- , and obviously through flashbacks we see this story for ourselves . these flashbacks take us to 1920 's alabama , where idgie forms a friendship with ruth jamison -lrb- the client 's mary-louise parker -rrb- , after the tragic death of idgie 's brother buddy -lrb- a brief chris o'donnell -rrb- , and working in the whistle stop cafe , cooking the signature dish , fried green tomatoes , and living through the great depression . these stories of ninny 's give evelyn great influence to confront her negligent husband . that 's the basic story i got , and they become true friends . also starring stan shaw as big george , cicely tyson as , gary basaraba as grady kilgore and richard riehle as reverend scroggins . tandy is likable as the nice old woman , bates is almost as good as the annoyed wife in need of attention , and there are one or two good moments in the flashbacks , but i do n't think it was fantastic , but certainly worth a go . it was nominated the oscar for best writing , screenplay based on material from another medium , and it was nominated the golden globe for best motion picture - comedy/musical . good !		6		1
reitman 's best , most successful film he has ever made was this catchy comedy which turned out to be 1984 's surprise hit thanks to the impeccable timing of its release . the leading trio play off each other sublimely , with murray as the prankster and both aykroyd and ramis in top form playing two rather socially inept scientists whose joint obsession with new york 's ghostly inhabitants leads the `` ghostbusters '' to fame and fortune . sigourney weaver plays the humorous love interest who turns nasty when spectral activity becomes centred around her apartment . also hilarious is rick moranis as the dorky accountant who becomes an unlikely `` keymaster '' in the closing scenes of the film . annie potts plays the over worked secretary , ernie hudson the hired fourth ghostbuster and william atherton is the thorn in the side from the environmental protection agency . dan aykroyd and harold ramis have written the screenplay which is quite sharp in both the freshness of the idea and the execution of the plot . the jaunty momentum and bright comedy is prevalent throughout . visually we are treated to some attention grabbing special f/x which dominate the `` ghostbusters '' encounters with the spooks . finally there is the trendy soundtrack which features the smash hit single `` ghostbusters '' from ray parker junior . saturday , september 27 , 1997 - video		6		1
director sam mendes has come out from the shadows after his success with american beauty , this time , i was dissapointed . there has been a lots of great threw the years : i say ; goodfellas - the godfather - casino - but here i think that they have done a small mistake , the movie does n't have the charm , mood or the dramatic that a good needs . tom hanks plays one of his very few characters as a almost evil man , he plays against good actors as paul newman , jude law and jennifer leigh . mike sullivan is a mob in the early . he works for the rooney that helped him out for many years back . mike 's wife knows that he is doing brutal missions , but that does n't his two sons know , peter and michael . but michael hides in the car one time and sees his father kill two men with a tommy gun . soon the wife and the youngest son peter gets killed by mike 's former . now mike and michael has to set out on a dramatic trip to chicago ... the movie is way to violent , no reason for that .		6		1
just my luck . i watched this on the tv , and i am happy i did n't pay to see it . it was ok , but nothing special . it is a romantic comedy about a girl who always has really good luck and a guy who has really bad luck all the time , but when they kiss their luck swaps around . it has got lindsay lohan and chris pine in . i am not a big lohan fan and i have only seen chris pine in star trek . they did ok , but there were a few scenes it it where the acting was terrible . also , the script was over the top puke at times . i know you need mushy conversations in a romantic film , but this was too much even for a romcom . there were quite a few funny moments though . it generally was a funny film . i was entertained while it was on , but i wo n't be watching it again . there were scenes where lindsay had some bad luck , and the way she tries to hide it or fix it just would not happen . the director of this film also directed how to lose a guy in 10 days ... i liked that , but this was not great . i will give this film a 6 out of 10 . i have seen a lot better . for more normal reviews , please like my facebook page . http://www.facebook.com/pages/ordinary-person-movie - reviews/456572047728204 ? ref = hl		6		1
john irving won an oscar for adapting his own novel to the screen concerning a new england orphanage in the early 1940s that houses as its caretaker an general practitioner -lrb- and sometime abortionist -rrb- who takes one orphaned lad under his wing and turns him into a first-rate medical assistant . as the years progress , the young man grows weary of being a part of a profession second-hand and travels to a neighboring town to work in an apple orchard . coming-of-age story with an episodic dramatic structure starts to work after most of the are blessedly out of the way -lrb- irving and director lasse hallström , two jaded souls , go surprisingly heavy on the and scenes -rrb- , and the casting is terrific . michael caine , who won a supporting oscar , is n't a wily eccentric or a fanciful dreamer ; he 's playing a deeply troubled man with conflicting views of the world , rebellious against the law but also a realist with flagging energy . as his protégé , tobey maguire overcomes the obviousness of his role and handles the latter portions -lrb- where he 's front and center -rrb- exceptionally well . maguire is given some difficult scenes to play , and he carries them off without being showy -lrb- his solemn face and calming manner are mature and yet boyish , but never gregarious -rrb- . as a dimpled , soldier 's sweetheart , charlize theron has an even more cookie-cutter role to fill , but she does just what is needed and looks beautiful to boot . there are some bummer scenes such as maguire 's speech on the docks about the futility of making decisions and an plot-thread that takes up time on the clock . worse , there 's a bit of impatience in waiting for this circular story to do its thing -lrb- with the passing of the torch and so on -rrb- ; yet , the film is carefully mounted for a moving pay-off , and only true curmudgeons would fail to be stirred emotionally by that finale . ** 1/2 from ****		6		1
super troopers may not be an all-time comedy classic but there are certainly enough laughs sprinkled throughout to make it worth your while . there 's not much of a plot but there are definitely plenty of antics . some of the gags misfire but enough hit their mark to leave you reasonably satisfied . the plot , such as it is , follows a group of vermont state troopers who face the prospect of having their squad shut down due to state budget cuts . when a murder occurs this could be the break they need . solve the case , save their squad . unfortunately , much to the chagrin of their squad captain , our heroes are much too consumed with their rivalry with the local town police and with their own never-ending antics to make any serious headway . but that 's ok , this movie is much more about antics than plot anyway . our cast of mostly unknowns careens from one gag to another , doing nothing by the book , doing anything to amuse themselves . at times , especially whenever an attempt is made to be even remotely serious , the movie lags . but eventually something preposterously funny will happen and you 'll forgive the filmmakers for their less inspired moments . there are no real standouts in the cast , there is hardly any plot to speak of and too many of the jokes fall flat . but in the end there are enough great comic moments to make it all worth it . a comedy classic ? nope . a comedy worth seeing ? yeah .		6		1
spoilers alert i was a big fan of the original film `` open your eyes '' and not because it itself is a perfect thriller . it actually was a bit of a mess , but also a daring , thrilling and interesting mess . anytime a filmmaker decides to work in the area of state - they can become lazy because of the freedom this genre allows . something not quite making sense - something not quite pulled off ??? oh well - it 's a dream . i can totally understand how cruise would see the original and , `` man , i could play the hell out of this guy '' and he does . cruise gives a good performance and this remake is actually better then i thought it would be but ... -lrb- spoilers ahead + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + ye be warned + + + + + -rrb- : ... the way either cruise as a producer or crowe or the studio insisted on how things must be explained -lrb- and -rrb- for that matter , is insulting to adult audiences . the spanish film laid it out there for you to decide what really happened and this film should have done the same . but obviously someone said no - we must explain - we must paint a sign for the audience so that ends up being quite a letdown . the film is very well cast and cruz -lrb- who is never as good in english as she is in her native tongue -rrb- probably gives her best performance in a hollywood film -lrb- of course she 's already played this girl in the original and she is as sparkling in this one as in amenabar 's version -rrb- . the real surprise is cameron diaz 's work . the role is a bit underwritten -lrb- or maybe trimmed down in the final cut -rrb- but she really gives dimension to what could be the one-note psycho stalker . when you think of her work in being john malkovich , charlie 's angels and now this - she really shows she can bring good work to almost any kind of film : art house , action blockbuster , etc. . by reading some of the other comments , i can see that many people do n't want to be challenged by a film , they do n't want to have to do any work as they watch a film , and that 's fine . i understand that . but carp about it when a film does try and make you think . there are plenty of other mindless films out there , god knows , so when movies like lantana , vanilla sky , innocence or even mulholland drive try and work outside the normal constraints of hollywood movie making , give them a tip of the cap . my one other complaint with crowe -lrb- who i admire very much -rrb- is he really has to stop with the wall to wall rock song soundtrack . we all know his rolling stone magazine background , we know his wife is nancy wilson heart , but there were many moments in vanilla sky where you did not need a song to remind you what feeling might be needed . it was a bit much - trust a scene to work without the pop song hook . 6 out of 10 stars but worth a viewing .		6		1
i know what you did last summer was made a year after scream , it even has the same writer . scream , though , was much better . this movie is n't anything new or interesting , it 's just like all the slasher movies that followed it , there is a group of good-looking teens that get hacked up one by one . ikwydls is one of the better ones though , as the acting is actually fairly good , there are one or two scenes of suspense and the killer is somewhat creepy . four teens hit a man . they dump his body . a year later they all start receiving threatening messages . julie -lrb- jennifer love hewitt -rrb- decides to find out who it is before the july 4th , the one year anniversary of their accident . for a teen slasher , this is ok . but their are a few things that kind of spoil what could have been a fairly decent movie . the deaths in this are n't very gory or interesting , which is needed for a slasher . the ending is really bad and of course , led way to the sequel , i still know , which was one of the worst movies ever made . the actors all did great jobs , especially sarah michelle gellar -lrb- who is involved in a 7 minute chase scene that is very intense -rrb- . 2 1/2 / 5 .		6		1
it 's hard to give a solid rating about dog soldiers . it 's a good movie that has a nice story , good characters , good scenes and some effective gore . it 's just that it could have been better at some aspects ; but i understand that it 's a low-budget film . or maybe it tries to deliberately look like one . if it did , it 's a success . and if it did n't then sadly it turned out like one . dog soldiers is a movie only fans of the genre will really appreciate . it 's certainly not bad , but if you start to get nit picky you will find some flaws in the movie . go watch it if you like werewolf movies or soldier movies . it 's really a combo of the two genres . 6 out of 10 stars .		6		1
the story of pirates of the caribbean : at world 's end can be summarized on a few lines.the problem is that the movie stretches a simple story to almost three hours of running time putting all the time deceptions and new , old , dead or forgotten characters in a complex but irrelevant story.i consider at world 's end to be better than the second part but that 's not saying too much ... the movie is fun and it has good special effects but , on some moments , the film is tedious and very slow.the movie has a very irregular tone ... the film starts funereal and it eventually becomes in stupid comedy used as an excuse when the screenwriters do not know how to finish the situations they example the scene in which one of the characters gets hold of davy jones ' heart thanks to the of the guards who take care of almost three hours of running time with special effects and very elaborated plans , was that the best solution the screenwriters kind of things happen a lot of are a lot of forced elements and shallow depp has an amazing performance in here and , as in the second part , he 's one of the saving nighy shows some emotion as davy rush has a very appropriate performance and keith richards is excellent on his character.the special effects are of the caribbean : at world 's end is fun but it 's disappointing because of some slow and tedious moments and a lot of forced elements .		6		1
this movie deserves its own wikipedia entry as the living embodiment of the phrase `` gratuitous nudity '' . it 's a mystery story about a new york city thief -lrb- robert downey jr. -rrb- who bumbles his way into being an aspiring actor in hollywood . he gets caught up with a gay private eye -lrb- val kilmer -rrb- and a girl he knew as a boy -lrb- michelle monaghan -rrb- who 's on the cusp of being a failed actress . it really is a pretty neat little mystery involving a dead sister , a severed finger , the old switcheroo and constant homages to a made-up series of pulp crime novels . but about half-way through the film there 's a scene between iowa 's own michelle monaghan and columbia 's own robert downey jr. where monaghan 's character goes into a bedroom and undresses and we briefly but quite clearly get to see her topless ... and there 's absolutely no reason for it . i 'm not one to generally complain about female nudity , but it 's just so obviously gratuitous in this instance . it does n't tell us anything about monaghan 's character , advance the plot or service some underlying theme in the film . they try and pretend that seeing her naked inspires downey 's character to remember something important about the mystery , but ... 1 . the filmmakers could have brought about that revelation in about a billion other ways that do n't involve monaghan 's nudity . 2 . what kind of a guy sees a living girl 's breasts and thinks of a dead girl 's non-existent panties ? if you watch enough movies , you see plenty of gratuitous stuff . nudity , profanity , gore , blasphemy , etc. . but in this instance it was sooooooo blatant , it made me wonder how they deal with the subject when they 're making the film . do the filmmakers come up with some elaborate lie about why we have to see monaghan 's character get naked ? does the producer have to come up with that lie at the beginning , or is it left to the director to come up with a convincing spiel on the day they shoot the scene ? are they honest about it ? when they cast michelle monaghan , did someone go up to her , point out the scene in question and say `` look . we think we can sell a few more tickets or rent a few more dvds to desperate , horny losers if you show off your perky pound puppies '' ? or is it some sort of societal taboo ? does everybody understand they 're doing something cheap and unworthy , but if nobody says anything out loud ... do they all just pretend otherwise ? apart from defining gratuitous nudity for the ages , this is a pretty good film . the actors all give good performances and there are only two points in the movie where something stupid has to happen to keep the story going , which is a heck of a lot better than most mysteries . the writing is also smart and relatively clever , but that is also the one significant problem with the film . kiss kiss , bang bang is one of those films that tries too hard to be too clever . downey 's character narrates the film in an ironic and self-aware tone , which would be fine in a more consistently and overtly comedic story . but many times the irony and self-awareness -lrb- and narration -rrb- goes away and it tries to play the story in a straight-forward , conventional style . and while the story is good enough to be played straight , the shifting back and forth between serious and satire keeps you from getting completely wrapped up in the film . i t 's almost as though the filmmakers think they 're too smart to be making a normal mystery , even though they 've got a really good story to tell . so they keep throwing in amusing and mostly intelligent little digressions , but while they 're enjoyable in their own right , they keep you from connecting with the characters as real people . you 're never able to lose yourself in kiss kiss , bang bang and forget that you 're watching a movie . and the filmmakers do n't seem to want you to forget . they want you to be aware of and admire how they 're telling the story . but in making the telling of the story more important than the story itself , they put a cool distance between the film and its audience and i ca n't help but think that a little less craft and a little more heart might have made a even better film .		6		1
went in cold on this , had never even heard of it , but tara had heard it 's worth seeing . `` fast food nation '' follows the story of mickey 's , a hamburger joint who 's just discovered that their meat patties have -lrb- poo poo -rrb- contamination . the send out a marketing executive -lrb- kinnear -rrb- to look into the meat facility and see what 's going on . in between this story we follow a group of mexicans who have immigrated illegally and gotten jobs at the meat plant . from my perspective , the aim of the movie was to show the evils involved in the industry , but by pushing more so from the angle of the mistreated workers . i 'm sure there 's truth in it , and it raises some questions , but probably overdid the meat plant story a tad . it held my interest , but the last 1/4 of the movie really dragged . worth a look , and done well for it 's aim .		6		1
you ca n't help but think while watching this that this definitely could have been a better film and basically all that was needed was just more clarity in the story . film starts in 1964 where a newlywed couple driving through nioba , mississippi have car trouble and while the groom is getting help the bride is raped by some horrible monster ! well , 17 years later eli maccleary -lrb- ronny cox -rrb- and his wife caroline -lrb- bibi besch -rrb- are having their son michael -lrb- paul clemens -rrb- checked out at the hospital after he starts having health issues . micheal is being controlled by the spirit of someone who was the victim of a terrible secret that nioba has kept hidden . ***** spoiler alert ***** micheal keeps sneaking out of the hospital and seeking revenge on those responsible for the secret but he 's also starting to turn into a monster himself . a creature that is coming to form but before he goes through the transformation micheal warns amanda -lrb- katherine moffat -rrb- who is a girl that he likes and may be of the wrong ancestry . this film is directed by the erratic philippe mora who at times seems perfectly suited for horror genre films but sometimes he even makes those badly . many will say that this is a terrible horror film but for those of us who really enjoy them we can overlook the glaring flaws in the script . we 're used to it ! why did clemens turn into a giant cicada creature ? we really never find out although at one point a character mentions something about someone who used to practice black magic . the film plods along at a pedestrian pace with clemens killing someone every 15 minutes or so but the real saving grace is the transformation scene late in the film . i first saw this film in the mid 1980 's on video and that scene really stuck in my mind as an incredibly effective moment . it 's hard to describe what it 's like to watch clemens head expand like a thanksgiving day parade float ! if your looking for a reason to watch this film than that would be a pretty good one . this is certainly not a classic in the genre but it does have a unique story with some interesting special effects .		6		1
alice along with a group of survivors attempt to travel to alaska via las vegas to escape a zombie apocalypse . i 'm not a player of the resident evil games , so all the films including this 3rd instalment are non-bias . i 'm not a fan of ` super ' zombie 's , however , i enjoyed this one more than the second . it was good to see zombies in a desert wasteland setting but the film has a cheap look to it in parts . oded fehr , iain glen and mike epps return , ali larter is a welcomed new addition as claire , but the rest of the acting from the supporting cast is n't too wonderful . milla jovovich -lrb- despite a odd hair-cut -rrb- once again is just what the doctor ordered as alice who develops her ` powers ' throughout . there are plenty of tussles , zombie action , killer birds and it has some great ideas , themes and a surprise electrifying closing . under russell mulcahy direction it has it 's moments . there is one stand out segment at a gas station , but again , like it 's predecessor it lacks the pulsing , foreboding , suspense and mood created by paul w.s. anderson in the first resident evil .		6		1
` case 39 ' : three stars -lrb- out of five -rrb- decent but not great horror film surprisingly starring renee zellweger . it 's directed by christian alvart -lrb- who now has several horror films under his belt including the impressive ` pandorum ' from 2009 , which he actually filmed after this -rrb- and written by ray wright -lrb- who also co-wrote the screenplays for the horror remakes ` the crazies ' and ` pulse ' -rrb- . the film was shot in 2006 and originally scheduled for a u.s. theatrical release in 2008 but was pushed back several times until last october -lrb- 2010 -rrb- , after being released in other parts of the world in 2009 . it got generally negative reviews from critics but holds a somewhat impressive average imdb user rating of 6.1 -lrb- meaning the fans like it a lot more than the critics -rrb- . it tanked at the box office but who could blame it under all that bad hype . zellweger plays a social worker named emily jenkins who 's given an assignment to check out the family of a ten year old girl named lillith -lrb- jodelle ferland -rrb- when signs of possible abuse begin to appear . upon meeting the girl emily immediately assumes something is not right between her and her parents and believes she 's in danger . after putting up a strong fight to save her she soon learns that everything is not as it seemed and the girl is definitely not as innocent as she appeared . she soon finds herself , as well as those close to her , in danger . zellweger is actually quite good in the movie . i at times find her pretty annoying and although i think she can be good and has been in certain roles i have n't seen her turn in a performance i liked in several years , until now . there are also nice supporting turns from ian mcshane , bradley cooper and ferland who is very effective and creepy as the villainous young girl . the writing is a little weak but alvart 's directing is very impressive and effective . it 's too bad he did n't have a better script to work with . i had a lot of fun while i was watching it but since have kind of forgotten the film and i 'm sure over time i 'll forget it even more . i was really surprised at how much i did like it though given my low expectations going into it . if you 're a fan of the genre and have the same low expectations you 'll probably enjoy it too . watch our review show ` movie talk ' at :		6		1
the spiderwick chronicles is the film for kids who were n't quite old enough to see pan 's labyrinth and are far too young to be able to remember jumanji . to say that it falls in between the two films in terms of overall grade is not saying much , as many films done such a thing , but while this does n't have the mature , sweeping majesty of del toro 's master work , it actually dares to be a bit more than the somewhat episodic demonstration of spooky special effects and meek character arcs that made up joe johnston 's 1995 action/horror concept movie . in short , the film is actually rather enjoyable and i was surprised as to how it eventually congealed into this pretty decent adventure piece about magical worlds and differing , fictional creatures with their own set of characteristics and agendas all coming to interact with one another and our own world . there is a fun giddiness to proceedings , and while it does n't quite crack the emotional marks of great magnitude for which it aims , there is a decent , solid adventure film in there with a genuine sense of terror and danger apparent . the film is about three child siblings who become mixed up in a plot to take over the world , a plot instigated by small , evil little creatures who 're led by one rather large evil creature . this character is the film 's strong antagonist , a shape-shifting ogre named mulgarath , played by nick nolte -- nolte appears to be channeling david bowie from 1986 's `` labyrinth '' , although the beast itself looks a little too much like a predator to be anything truly original or frightening . the children are mallory , simon and jared grace - with sarah bolger playing the eldest in mallory and freddie highmore doubling up in playing both of her younger brothers . the deadly , threatening means by which these creatures think they 're going to do this , however , is through that of ... . a book , and it is inside of their new home that this book is located . their new home is actually a rather old one , one of those large ; spooky looking houses from centuries ago which comes complete with a lone , circular window on its top storey . around it lies woodland , and there is nary another soul for miles . preceding this family of four moving in -lrb- not forgetting their mother , helen ! -rrb- was an odd scientist whose interests and experiments on animals and insects eighty years ago doubled up as the early findings on all that 'll follow . so far , so jumanji : the fatherless family unit with a young son , who does not speak ; of whom are at with one another in a social sense , thus need a lesson in teamwork , but of whom are then traversed off onto a scary adventure wherein they find an item in the attic -lrb- not a board game this time , a book -rrb- that carries with it the ability to induce the sort of horrors and impending doom only a special effects house could . it is some general messing around on a generally slow day that brings about the evils of this macguffin , namely : invisible goblins who , in spite of their ability , mostly decide to hide in the long grass anyway . they are invisible , of course , so that the grown-ups wo n't be able to see them , while the film tries to eke out as much tension as possible from the initial exchanges by having the one sibling no one will , in jared , initially stumble upon it . poor jared tries to tell his older sister about the threat of the impending doom and how he 's started to see mythical creatures who have appeared from nowhere and started talking to him . needless to say , it wo n't wash and it reminds us of the positive writings on a japanese animation from the 1980s entitled `` my neighbour totoro '' , when that particular film was praised for its subversion of such a limp tactic : its own infant characters found magical beasts only to rush and tell their parent , who actually believed them anyway and the film played out from there . when everyone is eventually in on it , the film gets some energy going and actually breaks out into a fairly involving ; fairly gripping piece which has them dart all around the local town on top of a couple of other places few have ever before treaded . there is an amusing stop to the local psychiatric hospital , where their great aunt lucinda -lrb- plowright -rrb- is housed out of her stumbling upon similar plots and creatures when she was a kid . back then , there was n't anyone around to believe her , thus she ended up where she is but the whole episode reminded me of what befell sarah connor in the second terminator film : a desperate attempt to inform everyone of a shocking reality , but no one around to actually chip in . thus , it 's off to the cells . one can only guess what her equivalent to the line : `` anybody not wearing two million is going to have a really bad day , get it !? '' was when trying to get across to her doctors that the end is nigh . there 's enough in the spiderwick chronicles to like ; this alternate idea that magical worlds full of unreal things are dangerous and could cost you your life as opposed to being these fun , fluffy places wherein you 'd quite like to lose yourself -lrb- alá the early harry potter films , et al. -rrb- is refreshing . its core themes of team work and trust are as apparent here as they are in the narnia films or anywhere else , while its imagery towards the end of the strong family unit working together as one blooded component to defend one 's home is striking in a world of gay adoption and such . in spite of its lack of originality , the film is exciting and fleetingly quite frightening -- a film those of a younger disposition will no doubt enjoy more than others , but that 's not to say it is impossible to enjoy whatever your age .		6		1
after ten years in prison for participating in a bank heist driving the getaway car , the driver is released . he runs to a junkyard where there is a car and a revolver waiting for him , then drives to an office and executes a clerk . detective cicero is assigned the case but soon a veteran detective near retirement teams up with her . meanwhile a hired killer is also chasing the driver . the driver hunts down and kills two other men and cicero discovers that his gang had successfully robbed a bank ten years ago . however , they are double-crossed and another crew steals the money and executes the entire gang . the driver miraculously survives and he sees his brother being executed . further , cicero also learns that the victims are former police informers and she concludes that the driver is avenging his brother killing his executors ... this film could have really been something . the rock has n't made a full on action film in a very long time , so after seeing the trailer , i was very excited . and while the film does hark back to gritty films from the seventies , it can be extremely boring at times , and it 's none of the casts fault as the three leads are flawless . i could imagine the pitch ` rock goes and shoots somebody , looks moody , cops investigate crime scene , assassin acts nuts . repeat six times , let 's have a twist as well ' . and that pretty much sums the film up , and it makes just over ninety minutes seem like schindlers list . the inclusion of an assassin doing his job for kicks is original , but he is nothing more than a whiny rich boy , with a beautiful wife , and a luxury house , it 's hard to sympathise . the ending is predictable and flat , but the film has it 's moment , and it 's nice to see the rock back in serious mode .		6		1
there 's a tendency in films of this nature , of the fast food nation kind , where you already know going into it what the message is . it 's not quite exactly as immediately black and white as it might seem -lrb- at first -rrb- , but then after a while it becomes much more clear . while filmmaker richard linklater does n't make very simple statements like ` fast food will make you fat ' , he does try to push the message that the sort of machinery of corporation is similar to that of the assembly line , is what is crippling to those entwined in the circle of cheap product made from dead meat . which is fine ; i 'm not one of those that think precisely along the lines of bertolucci , who was quoted as saying that he leaves messages for the post office and not for film . however , i do expect that if a filmmaker wants to put forward the message - and boy does fast food nation do that more than anything - to make the characters & / or story lines interesting in the dramatic framework . he achieves this , but only up to a point . narrative focus and dramatic drive only come through much more effectively within the last 45 minutes , while the first half seems startlingly dull , or at the least meandering . that being said , i did find elements here and there throughout the weaker section of the film interesting . there 's even a spellbinding aerial shot of the seemingly unending field of cattle , waiting for the slaughter . but for the most part early on we 're treated to the sort of set-up of the main story lines : a group of mexican illegals -lrb- one of them , sylvia , played well by catalina moreno -rrb- get picked up by a guy in a van , and taken to a ` mart ' in town , and go to find work . most of the illegals find it at a plant , where what is seen by a quasi executive type , don anderson -lrb- greg kinnear -rrb- , is not seeing everything he thinks he is when shown around the plant . he meets with a couple of people , one environmentally conscious and protective of his land from corporations -lrb- kris kristofferson -rrb- , and another who is cynical and not too optimistic -lrb- bruce willis , who has one of the best scenes in the film albeit with a speech attached -rrb- . meanwhile , as he goes into a mickey 's -lrb- ho-ho -rrb- to get a ` big one ' burger from amber -lrb- ashley johnson -rrb- , linklater and co-writer eric schlosser also follow her tale of nothingness of the small-town teenage girl . all of these stories interconnect at times , or are left to themselves . while one is actually intriguing and ultimately very sad , which is the mexican immigrants tale -lrb- that sense of tragic exploitation going on that ends up finding a place in the ` nation ' sense of the word -rrb- , the other two either spurt to a halt after a while , or just kind of go on aimlessly until the last few scenes . the former of those with kinnear does n't give him that much to do aside from listening to people talk , and on the phone talking to his family . in a way he could 've had his own film as a character , like with wally wiggins in waking life , but on its own linklater leaves him be after the first hour , and then coming to a wrap-around in a predictably dour manner in the end credits . amber 's story , on the other hand , is sort of the opposite - she is just a small-town girl living in a lonely world -lrb- as the song goes -rrb- , and sometimes listening to idiotic plots to rob the mickey 's by his co-workers , while here and there figuring out the future for herself . what 's both fascinating and frustrating about the film though could be seen sort of from amber 's storyline , where you see scenes that are convincing both in characters talking like real people -lrb- ala ethan hawke 's moments -rrb- , but also having not as much to do with the real ` message ' going across that one might think - that is until amber joins up with the young brigade and goes to cut a fence down to let the cows out . this actually had a real pathos to it , and was even entertaining -lrb- probably against linklater 's own intentions -rrb- . but it 's not just the writing or how linklater connects the stories together . acting wise it 's hit or miss - moreno is fantastic in a role that ends her up seeing the actual slaughtering of cows -lrb- which is staggering , whatever you think about serving meat in fast food -rrb- . but the huge ensemble either gets their little moments well like willis or hawke , or either ` phones it in ' like kristofferson or just outright sucks like lavigne . there 's even a convincing one-note turn by the sleazy , pig manager of the assembly line job -lrb- i forget his name -rrb- , but he too only get to have his character do what 's required in the script . as i walked out of the theater i realized that this was n't at all a bad film , in fact it 's a a pretty decent effort at dramatizing in fashion what it is to have the ugliness of consumer productivity . but that i also found it to be , of the films i 've seen of his so far , my least favorite of linklater 's , which goes to show how strong a work he can still deliver when when not working at full throttle . and it 's a little ironic considering how much of a success i found a scanner darkly to be , possibly coming closest to my favorite of his , and how both films take on a specific message to the audience , but one accomplishes it by basing it around characters and a really tightly-knit storyline and style that is consistently engaging , while the other is content to hop around from malaise to shock to whatever . grade : b		6		1
okay , this is a pure no-brainer . the story is very simple but still it is watchable due the fighting scene 's and the effects used . it 's not that it 's going to be a masterpiece , over here you can catch it new for 1 euro so that says enough . nevertheless , somehow i enjoyed it . it 's in the style of charlie 's angels -lrb- 2000 -rrb- storywise but it also is for people who liked sucker punch -lrb- 2011 -rrb- . the girls involved are exploited due their sexiness but naturally being rated for kids too no nudity is involved . in fact , some do go naked but nothing is shown . strangely being directed by a chinese -lrb- corey yuen -rrb- there is n't a drip of blood to notice , must be the rating ... on the part of the acting that was rather okay but my followers know that i 'm not into eric roberts and again he shows why . on the other hand holly valance was here to see . she came out of neighbours in 2002 after 3 years and became a pop idol having a number one hit in the uk with ` kiss kiss ' . she also was adored by many due her sexy looks and body . it is clearly to see why in this flick . naturally it is n't going to be remembered for the acting ... lovers of wwe wrestling will recognise kevin nash . the effects really saved this flick , one to see with your friends while having a beer . gore 0/5 nudity 0,5 / 5 effects 4/5 story 2/5 comedy 0/5		6		1

i have n't read the novel , though i 'm afraid i can imagine it being superior to this . honestly , i 've been putting off watching this for years . it 's cool that a dane wrote it , and that another one directed it . and it was actually partially filmed here , as well as , unusually , up in greenland , and a little bit of is spoken . it just does n't feel like much of anything was beefed up for the purpose of putting it up on the silver screen , and the fact of the matter is , it has to be bigger than it does on the page . as far as what is translated from the book goes , the mystery does work well . it is fairly engaging , and keeps you guessing to an extent . with that said , you know who 's behind it the moment you see him , since * the score instantly becomes ominous when the camera shows him * . this has its entertaining moments , and occasional humor . the performances are great , though these talented actors have all done better work elsewhere . ormond fails to make the character particularly likable , and her accent does not convince . editing and cinematography are nice enough . there is infrequent strong language , some violence and a sex scene in this . i recommend this to big fans of those involved in its production . 6/10		6		1
luis buñuel 's short film , `` un chien andalou '' is basically a series of surreal and shocking images , set to a great musical score , that do n't appear to have any meaning or even any relevance to each other . the scenes themselves are shocking and at times even hard to watch . the best of these scenes , and the one that best fits what i 've just said is the first one ; a sequence that appears to see a man slice a girl 's eyeball in half with a razorblade . the scene is amazingly unrestrained , especially for a movie made at the time this was . it 's also a classic example of how to show something , without actually showing it by mixing it in with other imagery . other strange and dreamlike sequences include a man dragging two pianos across the floor with a dead donkey on top of them , ants emerging from a hole in a man 's hand , a young man poking a severed hand in the street with a rod and a couple of others . after seeing this , you will wonder what it is you 've just seen and whether or not you 've just wasted fifteen minutes of your life , but i assure the answer is not . although this film does n't appear to mean anything , does n't make any sense and by all accounts is n't really ` good ' , what it is that you 've just witnessed is the film that has influenced just about every surrealistic picture made since . i do n't recommend seeking this out -lrb- unless you 're a buñuel completist -rrb- , but if you ever get the chance to catch it ; make sure you do .		6		1
meet dave -lrb- 2008 -rrb- ** eddie murphy , elizabeth banks , gabrielle union , scott caan , ed helms , kevin hart , mike o ' malley , pat kilbane , judah friedlander , marc blucas , austyn myers . harmless yet dopey sci-fi comedy with murphy in dual roles : a captain of tiny aliens and the spaceship formed in his shape they ride to earth in a plan to swipe the world 's water sources for their own gets the fish-out-of-water treatment when starship dave becomes friendly with the enemy , namely comely banks and her son myers in nyc . while the screenplay by rob greenberg and bill corbett is pedestrian , murphy makes up for the mirth with a somewhat return to form employing a lot of physical comedy and even though collaborating with most recent bomb norbit 's director brian robbins the film is a mild diversion for those who have small children and a fascination with size over matter . a few laughs but otherwise regrettably forgettable in the high concept of the wee with the gigantic .		6		1
this is a pretty typical , low-budget schlocky type 1960 's thriller starring - who else - vincent price as `` morgan '' - a scientist who seems to have been immune to a disease that killed everyone else on the planet , and who now has to struggle to survive against the mutants who come back to life as vampire-like creatures after dying from the disease . i 've never been really sold on price , but he did a pretty good job with this part . the story itself has a number of inconsistencies , the most significant of which revolved around `` ruth '' -lrb- franca bettoia -rrb- - the woman he discovers still alive . since she was infected like the rest of her group -lrb- which had found a means of controlling the disease but not curing it -rrb- i wondered why it was that she was able to be out and about during daylight hours . she suffered from all the rest of the symptoms except that one , and clearly the others who were like her were n't able to be out after sunrise , either - so why was that symptom strangely absent from her ? that was never explained , which leads me to believe that it was just a deliberate plot oversight to get her character into the movie . i also found the whole `` vampire '' thing too weird . this disease - which morgan calls `` the vampire germ '' - causes symptoms exactly like those of hollywood vampires ? they are repelled by garlic , ca n't look at themselves in a mirror , ca n't be out after sunrise , and morgan kills them with a wooden stake through the heart ! too weird , in my opinion . still , not a bad time-waster , and clearly a forerunner to `` night of the living dead . '' 6/10 -lrb- as an aside , this movie came to me in a collection of what are otherwise bela lugosi movies - why was this included ? - and it 's wrongly identified on the package as the 1924 movie of the same name , but which is a totally different story . a bit confusing to say the least . -rrb-		6		1
`` major dundee '' is a western hard to classify , in part because of some deliberate ambiguity in vision characteristic of director sam peckinpah 's later work , in part from trying to force too much into too small a space . the result is a picture deeply flawed though never uninteresting . the concept is terrific , anyway : in the waning days of the american civil war , an apache raiding party attacks a union force and makes off with three small boys . chasing them , with a mixture of union , captured confederate , and irregular civilian forces , is one major amos dundee -lrb- charlton heston -rrb- , a reckless albeit humane seeker of the same kind of glory that led george custer to little bighorn a decade hence . it 's a big role tailor-made for heston , who fills the part in his singular way , going for the big moment even when delivering the smallest of lines , doing so with the kind of nuance and wit that carries you along for the ride . heston imitators like phil hartman must have had a field day watching as heston , stripped to his undershirt but still wearing a manly neckerchief , tells his head scout -lrb- james coburn -rrb- : `` do n't get yourself killed . that would inconvenience me . '' also terrific is richard harris as the leader of the captured confederates , tyreen , a fellow more noble than dundee but nursing an even more bloated sense of wounded pride . harris was another blowhard actor who overdid it a lot but nails it here . between dundee and tyreen is much of the film 's central conflict . to peckinpah 's credit the early scenes showcasing this tension are every bit as tense and exciting as the action sequences later on . peckinpah even gets great service from such disparate elements as comic actor jim hutton -lrb- who does n't seem to belong in a peckinpah picture , yet makes it work here as a befuddled lieutenant with able help from heston -rrb- , location shooting in mexico , and that sometimes call to mind david lean 's work on `` lawrence of arabia . '' peckinpah was trying to make the same kind of epic as `` lawrence , '' vast in scope and profound in message . here `` dundee '' gets into serious trouble . as dundee 's band rides on , the script ambles off into strange directions , shoehorning a romance and a drinking binge for dundee that pulls us away from the central story even as that mutates into twin conflicts with the apaches and the french , all resolved in a rushed and unsatisfying fashion . minor characters , played by name talents like dub taylor and slim pickens , are established as if they herald things to come , only to completely disappear instead . the theme music is as ill-fitting as coburn 's phony beard . by all accounts peckinpah eventually lost interest in `` major dundee , '' and the result is a film that never finds its way . but it is never dull , and often arresting , especially as it gives heston one of his broadest acting canvases . dundee would be unsympathetic in almost anyone else 's hands , but heston gives him a humanity that draws him closer , and makes his foibles more real to us , even to some degree shared , as we watch every other character in the film round on him sooner or later and find ourselves pulling for dundee even when he 's wrong . however lacking in discipline `` dundee '' is , you can watch it over and over and come away entertained and with a different feeling each time , which shows something was working . a problem picture , yes , but one with a lot of heart , soul , and vision , a failed experiment but one worth experiencing all the same .		6		1
to tell the truth , i was a little confused by the plot . yes , it 's true . the story that used to be on every high school reading list lost me here and there . i ca n't remember the original , but did it really include so much detail about family trees and inheritances and local conspiracies to hide forbidden truths ? it 's hard to believe that it did . it probably does n't matter that the story is confusing at times because the cinematography and set design are are so resplendently dismal as to be spooky in themselves . and if the constant twilight , the desaturated colors , the late fall atmosphere , the general gloom of both the interiors and exteriors do n't creep you out , there 's always the headless hessian horseman with his flailing blades . -lrb- he twirls them around in his hands like a gunfighter 's six-shooters and they have this swishing sound . -rrb- the acting is pretty good too . johnny depp seems a little stiff at time but maybe the part calls for it . christina ricci looks almost edible with her wide forehead , enormous doll-like eyes , and diminutive . the supporting players are all just fine , including christopher lee , with the exception of the kid who serves as crane 's sidekick . he sounds as if he 's still practicing his lines . the story has a couple of false starts . depp is first set up as a kind of visionary sherlock holmes type . he has invented new tools for investigating crime scenes . but none of them is explained and he is seen using them only once , for a purpose we ca n't define . we expect him , based on this early exposition , which leads to his exile from new york city to sleepy hollow , to be a scientific genius . but that 's soon gotten out of the way . it is n't long before he meets the horseman himself and realizes he 's dealing with the supernatural . at that point , alas , the movie begins to lean more heavily on the clichés of the slasher movie . people do stupid things that put them in danger , for instance . having just run away from the horseman and knowing they are still being stalked by him , two guys stop running , turn around , and stare into the fog to see if their pursuer will show up . -lrb- huh ? -rrb- the constituents of the slasher movie are always there , lurking in the mist , ready to attack at any moment , like the headless horseman -lrb- and i do mean `` headless '' -rrb- . the very first murder , in the opening few minutes , has a guy in a cornfield get his head lopped off and we see the blood splatter across the face of a jack o ' lantern . almost all the heads are chopped off graphically on the screen although there is n't that much blood , thanks . i suppose that kids , who ought to enjoy this movie , were part of the intended audience so the gore was contained . as for the horseman himself -- well , i do n't think i like him too much . he 's presented as an immortal action figure . he 's always in motion , galloping a horse at full speed , striding quickly around . he 's dressed in a black cloak over black armor , which is alright , but i think he might have been spookier if he 'd been less energetic and more of a plodding , implacable menace . the staging of his attacks are low-brow . there are sword fights out of any number of action movies , with two antagonists , flashing blades , twirling figures , swishing and clanking sounds -- all to no purpose since it 's already known that the horseman ca n't be beaten . at least they did n't throw in any flying kicks from the chop movies . but the figure himself is really terrifying , especially when we do n't have a clear view of him . the parts i enjoyed most were simply those in which frightened people were whispering in the shadows . the look and the feel of the late 18th-century hudson valley are admirably conveyed , though even that is a little too heavily laid on . ca n't remember a single scene that takes place in broad daylight . it 's as if the sun did n't exist in sleepy hollow .		6		1
silly science fiction movie about a man who is on the run from the cops trying to defend himself against a crime he is supposed to commit in the future . he 's in trouble because three women in a swimming pool see future crimes . it all sounds preposterous and spielberg has done nothing to make it any more interesting . in fact spielberg is so absorbed with special effects that the convoluted and confusing plot seems to have been put on the back burner . with the plot failing to sustain interest and the characters difficult to identify with , the special effects become pretty tedious to watch very quickly . cruise tries to look intense .		6		1
generally intended to be a campy satire . but it seems to me that they just would n't go far enough in that direction . that 's ok , since that sort of movie is really hard to pull off . so , there were a hodgepodge of other dramatic and comedic elements . it was , at least , reasonably original , and deserves some credit for that . ca n't really say that much about the acting . nobody really stood out . it was all competent and professional , at least for this sort of film . there were a number of amusing running jokes , such as the fake marine life , the way the crew went about casually armed , anne-marie -lrb- robyn cohen -rrb- frequently hanging about topless for no obvious reason , and the brazilian crew member often playing guitar , and singing david bowie songs in portuguese . overall , i say it 's worth checking out .		6		1
`` phenomena '' is dario argento 's eighth horror success in a row , this time set in a swiss -lrb- pardon me : swiss transylvanian -rrb- boarding school where the girls are frightened to death . a maniacal killer is loose in the area since quite a while and the local police forces have no idea how to stop him . the cute jennifer is an american new arrival who fancies insects , sleepwalks and has a famous actor as a father . with the help of a nearby living entomologist , she discovers that she has telekinetic powers that make it possible for her to communicate with insects . this ability might help her a great deal in tracking down the whereabouts of the feared killer ... out of argento 's entire repertoire , this `` phenomena '' is the most difficult one to rate . some of the style elements and gimmicks used belong to the director 's finest achievements to date while other aspects are embarrassingly incompetent and crappy . although i admire the fact that dario attempted to enrich the standard giallo-like plot with supernatural ideas , the hunt for the murderer is too often ignored which results in a more or less disappointing climax . you ca n't guess along in identifying the killer , as you 're given no clues or additional info at all . also , the plot holes and illogicalness of the script sometimes make it impossible to take this film serious . and by illogicalness , i do n't necessarily mean the whole `` communicating with insects '' - premise but merely the fact that this 14-year-old girl and a swarm of bugs simply succeed in what the police officers failed to for over more than eight months . and personally , i did n't think it was well-considered to send out a fragile young girl on her own to look for rotting corpses , but our entomologist in wheelchair seemly does n't have moral issues with that . similar to this little example , the script features several other ridicule elements that often make you wonder how on earth argento gained the reputation of talented scriptwriter . and yet despite all this ineptness , `` phenomena '' still is a truly powerful horror film that easily crushes most american competitors of the 80 's decade simply thanks to argento 's genuine sense of atmosphere and petrifying storytelling . dario argento is a phenomenon himself and every film of his is worthy viewing ... it 's as simple as that ! the tone of phenomena is very eerie and compelling and you 're presented to a never-ending series of beautiful mountain scenery and stylish cinematography . as mentioned above , the setting of this tale is switzerland and argento emphases this by a great use of typically swiss things , like cuckoo clocks and isolated mountain roads . the soundtrack is downright brilliant with an excellent use of hard rock songs by iron maiden and , while argento 's regular band goblin delivered its greatest title song ever ! the dazzling instrumental composition sticks to you long after you finished watching the film ! the acting performances are far above the italian standards with jennifer connelly in a terrific role . connelly is quite a big star right now , with major productions like `` requiem for a dream '' , `` hulk '' and `` a beautiful mind '' on her repertoire , but it was in fact the italian shlock industry that initially discovered her talent ! whoever claimed this type of cinema is entirely worthless . donald pleasance slightly disappoints as the tame entomologist and all the young actresses in their debuts easily outshine him . and , of course , we would n't be talking about an argento movie if it did n't contain lots and lots of gore . phenomena is particularly outrageous , with truly nasty slaughtering and detailed images of gruesomeness . especially if you purchase the uncut 110 minutes version , a word of warning is in order , i think . definitely not for the squeamish but warmly recommended to italian horror buffs !		6		1
road to bali is paramount 's sixth excursion down that road of gags with bing crosby , bob hope and dorothy lamour -- and the material is silly but fun in the sort of way that the hope and crosby fans expected whenever a new `` road '' picture came out . in this case , they were even more grateful than usual when paramount gave the men technicolor and dorothy lamour again for a playmate . nothing really new here . the men are on the lam for some reason from australia , and when they land on a tropic isle without work they volunteer to become deep sea divers in a hunt for buried treasure . naturally , their employers are up to no good and the rest of the film has bing and bob trying to escape the clutches of the bad guys while enjoying and fighting over the charms of princess lala -lrb- lamour , of course -rrb- . the usual sight gags involving snake charmers and unexpected bit cameos from well-known stars -lrb- humphrey bogart is seen in a clip from `` the african queen '' trudging through the jungle swamp -rrb- , and jane russell emerges for another gag routine . hope and crosby keep the quips sounding as though they ad-libbed as they went along -lrb- although this is not entirely true , i 'm sure -rrb- . whatever , it 's all in good fun and it 's good to see them sharing the screen with the fetching lamour , who gets to warble the film 's best song , `` '' , in that sultry manner she was famous for .		6		1
even for a three hour film . the story of alexander the great is an interesting one , but stone begins when he is a young child and tries to fit all he can in 3 hours . i thought it made the film too broad and hard to follow in places since there are quite a few flashbacks . it would have been better , if the story had been narrowed . maybe begin just as alexander was named king and then follow him as he conquered the east . one question i have after seeing this was did every man in 320 bc wear eyeliner ? was eyeliner even invented then ? and jolie is as hot as ever but was it possible for a woman to have flawless makeup at this time ? i was also disappointed with the battle scenes . they were too choppy and not that great . the battles in gladiator were much better . the blood was flying everywhere , but you just could n't tell much about what was going on . and the acting was not very good by anyone . i thought farrell was pretty bad and i 've liked him most of the movies he has done . and why did jolie even bother with an accent . and she was the only one who tried to have an accent . we know they did n't speak english at this time , so why bother with fake accents . final verdict : the story of alexander that stone wanted to tell would have been better if it was a 10 hour mini series on the history channel . he tries to tell to much in 3 hours , which makes the film seem disjointed with a lack of a central story . i do n't think it was as good as troy , and that was n't that great either , so i do n't recommend this one .		6		1
not a bad movie . eastern promises has the bbc style of british films . crisp , and straight forward is the movie with a mix of cronenbergs brutality . hands being chopped , violent fights , and the ugliness of prostitution is portrayed in this movie . i grew up in a slavic culture , and the movie address the frankness , hardness of the culture with the mix of joking and friendship . the film reminds me of the many family event i have attended . for the films research ! the film unravels a few mysteries , but has a disappointing ending . the reaction i had for the ending is that 's it . what a disappointment . i knew the ending was for dramatic purposes i guess i am so use to the more tv style of rap up endings . 6 out of 10 . maybe 7 . a good rental .		6		1
damien : omen ii is a sequel that continues where the original omen left . it 's by no means in the same league as the original but still offers some good moments here and there . the acting is solid , william holden is awesome , the kills are good and the score by jerry goldsmith is excellent . the script and direction is a letdown but it could have been much worse . the acting is n't as good as the original omen . william holden and lance hendriksen are awesome as always but the rest of the cast fail to impress in any way . none of them are bad , but the material does n't give them anything juicy to do . holden and hendriksen can do great even when the script sucks but that ca n't be said about other actors . script is where damien : omen ii falls flat . 2/3 of the film are just recycled material from the original omen , almost beat for beat . the setup and the way plot goes is almost the same . the only difference is the fact that damien is older and can start to understand who he is , but , sadly , he is beyond underdeveloped and all the possibilities for interesting character study are lost . it just looked like producers wanted this film to be more like first omen and made the writer cut the psychological character heavy stuff out . if they went for character study and mixed it with satanist horror , damien : omen ii would have been a great horror film that would rival the original or , even exorcist . but what we have here is fairly decent and entertaining but hardly memorable . direction by don taylor is nothing you would write home about . not terrible and not very good . when you look at his filmography , you will see that he has done a lot of tv work and it explains the very tv movie feeling damien : omen ii brings . it 's not as cinematic or interesting as original but by no means bad . just looks fairly bland , but few with a director with a certain visual touch , this film could have looked great . the score by jerry goldsmith is cool and moody as always . it 's not as memorable as the previous film but still manages to bring the creepy satanic feel up . damien : omen ii is bland and has markings of a great sequel . but like many other horror sequels , this film just reminds us how great the original film was . it 's hardly the worst sequel out there and it 's no exorcist ii : the heretic but you can hardly call anything but `` okay '' . if you liked the original and want to see how they continue the story , it 's worth checking out for william holden alone .		6		1
scary movie 4 is typical zany zucker . so many sight and dialog gags that if you do n't pay attention constantly you miss something . making fun of at least 5 of the more recent scary movies , there was much to see and hear . war of the worlds , saw , the village , dawn of the dead , and a couple of others . all these movies were rolled into many interlocking scenes that took you on a wild ride and kept your attention . there were a few scenes that just did n't need to be done and appealed more to the disgusting side of the viewer , but that 's life . strong acting included some of the cast of the previous movies and helped make the film work . if you like puns and sight gags , you 'll love this movie . if you like a realistic and sensible storyline , try something else .		6		1
albert nobbs was a passion project of glenn close 's for years , and now it 's finally realized on the big screen , but probably not as well as she had hoped . the movie is admirable for what it tries to do , but i found the screenplay 's characterization a bit uneven . rodrigo garcia 's direction is decent stuff , elegant , but also a bit stuffy , draggy , and even bland in a way that hinders a good chunk of the cast , two in particular . aaron johnson sticks out like a sore thumb , and i adore mia wasikowska , but she just did n't do much for me in this movie . however , the movie finds strength in the performances of two actors : glenn close and janet mcteer . they , costume designer pierre , and the fantastic makeup artists have to go to great lengths to make us think their characters are male , and they succeed to the point that you forget these people are even women at all . close is quietly controlled and emotionally layered , and mcteer is scene stealing with her gentle presence . they give two performances that deserve a lot better than the movie they 're in . ** 1/2 out of ****		6		1
ultimately pointless and disappointing , phil kaufmann 's update of don 's low budget classic of justifiable paranoia transposes the setting to san francisco . an effective opening , a classic closer , and a terrific homage to the mephisto waltz justify this enjoyable though over extended remake . the original at only 80 minutes long was quietly menacing , had the feel of a waking nightmare and effectively used it 's small town setting . the 1978 film features too many scenes of people being chased by shrieking crowds and an over reliance on special effects without any real payoff . and leonard nimoy as the psychiatric voice of reason feels so expendable . the film is more diverting than the other 2 remakes which followed .		6		1
star wars : attack of the clones gets the big 6 for me . while this movie was not good enough to be put up on the throne of excellence with the original star wars , i put this as a good popcorn flick . we have a good story but this film results in hits and misses . big hits include jengo fett , boba was my favorite character from the original trilogy and jengo was a nice return to the fett character , the battle with mace windu in the colosseum , the battle with yoda and dooku ... for a little guy that jedi could move , and the speed racer race between anakin and obi to find the evil female assassin through the city . now here are the misses . i hated the love sequences between padme and anakin i nearly fell asleep , not enough jengo fett , not enough mace windu and his cool lightsabre , and it seems george lucas wants to bore us to tears to enjoy this film . sure he made a better movie than phantom menace but that 's not saying much.i do n't get why we do n't see dooku till the end . i liked the performance made by christopher lee as dooku , only wishing there was more of him . with star wars - attack of the clones , you have to tell yourself that this is of the new trilogy . chances are you would want to stick to the originals for real entertainment and watch this when you want to kill time .		6		1
`` mirrors '' - a movie about possessed - you guessed it - mirrors . well ... have n't we seen that movie before ? that 's right , it was called `` poltergeist iii '' and it sucked . well , yeah , the concept may be old but hey ! you can never get enough of the old cliché . and it never gets old watching the camera swerve from the mirror image to reality back to the mirror to reveal : jesus ! the images differ ! there 's something going on !! alright , let 's get it out of the way : the premise is n't the only thing that sucks . kiefer sutherland 's performance is unintentionally funny at times -lrb- did anybody else notice that this guy is always sniffing as if he had a cold in every goddamn role he plays ? he seems to think that 's got something to do with acting , i guess -rrb- , and seeing director aja move on to a mediocre movie like this is just sad . a burned down department building should have made for a nice horror film setting , but aja somehow did n't know how to make this place atmospheric and spooky . from the outside the place looks like a mate painting that a low budget movie from the 80 's would have used . the cgi in general is bad . in one particularly bad scene someone catches fire and it looks as if the effect had been made with imovie . even in the infamous scene the usage of cgi is obvious . that 's just unnecessary -lrb- although the scene is still pretty cool -rrb- . the story does n't make sense at times . we 're never sure what the mirrors can and ca n't do . it 's as if the movie makers had n't understood the concept themselves . in the end the mirrors ' powers are seemingly unlimited . people can reach out of them , be sucked into them ... rendering the previous `` suspense '' illogical . another thing that 's particularly retarded is the fact that in the third act of the movie we find out that the department building was built over a hospital - literally built over it . like the cellar of the hospital is still intact with the electricity working . dammit , i may be a horror fan , but i 'm not completely braindead . however , i 'm not very demanding , so after having stated all these flaws , i still have to say that i was mildly entertained by `` mirrors '' . at least it had nothing to do with vampires , zombies , werewolves , slashers or japanese ghosts . how many other horror movies can claim the same these days ? so no , `` mirrors '' is n't recommendable , but it 's not a complete waste of time , either . still , i 'm not putting so much faith into mr. aja 's future anymore . this movie probably means 7 years of bad luck for his career .		6		1
i never saw this film on its original release , and have somehow missed it in the intervening years until now . i guess that there is nothing left to say about the mature performance that was given by christian bale -lrb- but it was ! -rrb- so i 'll -lrb- mostly -rrb- skip that . so , how was the film ? well , it strikes me that japanese prisoner of war camps probably really were not that much fun . i appreciate that this was an all-ages film , and that demonstrating that the japanese were just people too was part of the point , but i still feel that the overall terror and brutality of the situation was not as well conveyed as it should have been . the camp , as seen through jim 's eyes , seemed like a slightly grungy butlins -lrb- well , not really , but you catch my drift -rrb- . bizarrely -lrb- for a self-professed movie fan -rrb- i 've not seen schindler 's list either , and i am now even more curious to see how spielberg handled that world war ii story in comparison .		6		1
1st watched - 6 out of 10 -lrb- dir-richard donner -rrb- : convoluted plot but just watching gibson & roberts work with the characters innermost feelings and bring them to the surface makes this movie watchable . maybe they 'll appear together again in a better movie .		6		1
spoiler well the stallone bashers are out in full force for this film . i do not mind it ; stallone does comic book action heros well , rambo , judge dredge , etc. . i like these forms of escapism , take them for what they are junk food for the mind . this film is not a steak , its a 7-11 pizza sub sandwich , which goes well with a coke . the is great , after that the story laps into a comic book style , with a high body count ending , along with the big entertaining action movie fight for the climax . i gave it a 6 , as i get older the film gets cheesier like the pizza sub , but in the macho 80 's as a teenager this film would be a 8 . even as i get older i still watch this one on tbs , and can not stop watching it no matter how many times they show it , until my wife makes me change the channel . its fun to watch , but its not for everyone , and all the stallone basher out there , you crap on this guy , but have you seen hard to kill or out for justice by i mean those are some pretty desperate low budget films .		6		1
the first time i heard of alien : resurrection was when a reader of those hollywood magazines reported reading about a new alien sequel rumoured to be in the works . according to his statement , ripley would be `` brought back '' by cloning . given that sigourney weaver insisted that she be killed off at the end of the previous film , those in the know were skeptical that she would even appear . in spite of all that , they found the right price for her , and the rest is history . thankfully , she had the good sense to avoid the dreadful alien vs. predator project . apparently , she read that script and said it sounded like a dreadful idea , which makes one wonder why fox has never examined some of the ideas in such sources as dark horse comic books . thankfully , fox learned their lesson from the alien 3 experience . instead of rushing an incomplete script into production , they hired a decent writer and gave him time to come up with something watchable . as with aliens after alien , the decision was also made to attempt to follow up a slow , languid science-fiction/horror piece with a fast-paced , breathless science-fiction/action piece . the results , while not even remotely able to compete with the best of the series , are such an improvement upon alien 3 that it makes the elements of gibson 's alien 3 script that can be seen in alien : resurrection a bitchslap to productions . however , a number of problems keep alien : resurrection from really achieving its potential . one of them is the casting . while brad dourif can be believed in a film like this in spite of his relatively tiny size , winona ryder screams out `` miscast '' like roseanne barr would as the lead in a porn film . not only is she tiny even in comparison to dourif , her mannerisms and voice scream a softness that the world of the alien series will not suffer . that she lives to see the end while more appropriate characters like those portrayed by michael wincott or dominique pinon bite it about forty minutes after they are introduced indicates that plausibility was a secondary concern to the director . the design of the alien-human hybrid in particular makes one wonder exactly what was going on in the minds of the production team . apparently , a more crab-like version was originally proposed , but changed in order to make it seem more `` plausible '' . that ... thing ... is meant to be plausible ? i must have been asleep when they redefined that word . the statement that the alien queen also now has a human reproductive system is a bit of a joke , given that it is implied in the same monologue that she reproduces . then again , given that the prologue expects us to believe they can obtain an alien by cloning someone who carried one once , i doubt that respect for the audience 's sense of the plausible was a big concern . to the credit of the film , ron perlman makes an excellent addition to the canon . unlike ryder , one has no trouble believing perlman could survive well in a universe like this . weaver has also grown in terms of acting to the point where the role of ellen ripley fits her like a glove . she could practically portray this role in her sleep , so there 's not much chance of her not giving an awesome performance . with the new direction the character is taken in , she shows that there is nothing she can not do if given a chance . in the end , however , the flaws outweigh the strengths . i do n't know whether the seven minutes added to the special edition for a 2003 release fix this , but i doubt it . as a result , i 'd rate alien : resurrection a six out of ten . it is far better than its most immediate predecessor , but long-time fans of the series had a right to expect more .		6		1
in yes man , anti-social carl -lrb- jim carrey -rrb- has been sinking lower into negativity since leaving his girl , stephanie -lrb- molly sims -rrb- , making dumb excuses not to attend any social events with his friends , turning down loan applications at his job , saying ` no ' to life in general , spending every night blankly watching dvds in his apartment . kinda like you 're doing right now ... one day he meets a crazy coot friend -lrb- john michael higgins -rrb- , whose life has changed drastically due to his allegiance with a group who say yes to everything . carl attends a `` say yes '' meeting - by guru terrence -lrb- terence stamp -rrb- - and accepts the challenge to say yes , to be a yes man . and he finds that saying yes leads to myriad life-changing possibilities , money , success and , of course , panty , in the form of insipid zooey deschanel . -lrb- the tryst with his 70-year-old neighbor who insists on `` pleasuring him sexually '' does n't count ! oh , great gums ! how that does n't count ! -rrb- yes man marks carrey 's return to his forte - that plastic , elastic , bombastic spastic who refuses to grow up . it is obvious which carrey movie yes man resembles - liar liar -lrb- 1997 -rrb- , where a birthday wish from his son forced carrey to tell the truth for 24 hours . no such mysticism here , which is this movie 's saving grace . carl 's decisions to say yes are made under no duress or magic - just a leering curiosity to see where it all leads . and the explicit message is very succinct - that being positive is better than being negative -lrb- just do n't tell that to a person with aids -rrb- ; that it should not be a compulsion or a rule to say yes , but a decision ; that it opens up possibilities that might not have been created had you said no . simple . a light-hearted film which does n't even annoy me when carrey and deschanel trip through the usual romantic arc of `` boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , '' which only proves yes man advocates the same tired , insidious message of procreation guised as something wondrous and mysterious . how difficult can it be , humans ? when it comes to sex , just say yes . -- review by poffy the cucumber -lrb- for poffy 's movie mania -rrb- .		6		1
oliver stone ? an epic movie of the greatest king alexander ? come on ! i really really admire you , oliver . i admire the movies you made in the 1980s . i love jfk so much that i really ca n't believe this `` epic '' you made . how much did they spend to make this big movie with such an expensive cast including angelina julie , hopkins and val kilmer ? maybe this is the only reason for some people to see this one , i believe . but did they worth it ? hmmm ... maybe . if you like watching some brad pitt style performance by colin the boy , you will like it somehow . but the problem is there are really too many colors which are so abused in the movie . everything seems unrealistic , maybe the director spent too much in telling some trivia like the source of `` monkey '' . but if you ca n't feel any distance between india and babylon , how could you be satisfied with the discovery of monkey ? i 'm wondering if those gore scene about elephants should be cut due to the 'm also wondering if all the porno scenes could really amuse the audience . after all , they should have made it a cartoon with so many colors and so unrealistic battle scenes involved . and if so , it would have been awesome .		6		1
based on a true story , erin brokovich is a single young mother who is trying to find a job and raise her 3 kids . after getting in a car accident and loosing in court , she litteraly forces her lawyer -lrb- albert finney -rrb- to hire her at her firm to do some clerical work . erin discovers some old case about some former client wanting to get more money for her house that the nearby wants to buy . in probing deeper she discovers , more than meets the eye and that it appears the company was responsible for contaminating groundwater thus everyone in the community . so it turns out erin with no legal experience and working in a very small firm , sets out for a courtroom battle david vs goliath story . hollywood loves these movies . it seems this role was perfectly tailored for roberts . finney is good a her boss too . the movie is somewhat interesting but i did n't feel the need to route for the good guy , or get seriously pumped or motivated by the film . i did n't find it that humourous either considering that erin is portrayed as someone with a very short fuse and . the only scene i got a good laugh out of was when the legal team from the chemical corporation was coming in to the small private firm . in some quick thinking to show that the small firm was n't going to be , they get half of the clerical staff to dress up like lawyers and walk in the meeting room as a combined show of force . the movie was at least entertaining and ok rating 6 out of 10 .		6		1
matt and christina drayton are wealthy san fransisco liberals . one day their daughter jo comes home with a very respectable man , dr john prentice , and announces they are to be married . the only minor concern is that the draytons are white and dr prentice is not ... whilst it might seem a little dated by today 's standards this was an extremely important film of its day , and its intimate little family drama still has bite , wit and philosophy . matt is forced to confront his prejudices , but more importantly to balance his instinctive desire to protect his daughter with his trust in her judgement . the fact that john is in so many ways the perfect husband and a potential son-in-law to be proud of only makes things harder . all the characters and performances are rich , and as the drama cranks up with the arrival of john 's parents , kramer exploits the nervous undercurrents and tensions of the setup perfectly . for such a slight and tender story -lrb- it all takes place in one day in mostly one house -rrb- it is also richly photographed by sam leavitt , who makes all the emotional closeups count and has a fine eye for a scene - the sunset sequence where hepburn walks across the terrace and looks at the bridge is simply exquisite . poitier is sensational here , hepburn is gentle and measured , houghton -lrb- hepburn 's real life niece -rrb- is perky , kellaway and sanford steal their scenes as a daffy vicar and melodramatic maid respectively , and glenn and richards give fine dignified performances as poitier 's parents . the best of all though is tracey as the calm , thoughtful matt , somehow finding a balance between cool logic and emotional strength . his final summation at the end will make you laugh and cry and sadly it was his final film - he died only a few weeks later . nicely written by william rose -lrb- the ladykillers -rrb- , with a great sensitivity for the subject matter but also a fine balance of comedy and pathos - both he and hepburn won oscars . stanley kramer is perhaps a little underrated as a director in historical terms , but he really tried to make a difference and raise awareness with his movies -lrb- on the beach , inherit the wind , etc -rrb- , and often succeeded with superb style , as in this timeless drama .		6		1
for men , this is the horror movie of horror movies . this is one mythological story that i would probably been better off not knowing . the story line and acting were nothing to write home about . it started off slow , and did n't pick up until it was almost over . jess weixler did a credible job in the lead as someone who was cursed , but confused . it definitely caused some freudian anxiety as the castration occurred and the penises lay on the ground . the incident with the dog was particularly funny . you better watch out because now we have someone out there that can turn in on at will and if you p * ss her off ...		6		1
this movie was ok . the music and dancing were pretty good . but the story was nothing new . i did like the 2 lead actors . they helped to make the film entertaining enough to watch . both were hot . and i think channing tatum should be the next break out hot star . the final dance routine that combined ballot and hip hop was one of the better dances i 've seen in a film . tyler 's friends were a little annoying since they kept trying to get him in trouble and acted like he was putting them off by trying to learn a dance routine . it took mac 's little brother dying for him to see living a life of a delinquent was no way to be . very predictable . also , the school 's principle had to be about the most predictable character i 've ever seen in a film . final verdict : if you like hip hop and dancing , then you will find this entertaining enough to watch . otherwise , skip it .		6		1
it is clear that viewers will either love this movie , or just hate it with a passion . judging by the crowd gathered at the angelika when the film made its commercial debut , the reaction fell somewhere in the middle . it is clear director lars von trier is a believer of tackling subjects that might not resonate with his audience . such is the case with `` melancholia '' which is divided in two sections , both involving two sisters that are as different as day and night . the wedding of justine and michael is an odd affair . for starters , their stretch limousine can not make it through the country lane it must take in order to reach the home of her sister claire , where the reception is to be held . being late does not matter to justine one bit . she is not your typical bride intent in having a great time at her own wedding . one has to question if justine is in love with michael . is it all for show ? things get complicated when claire 's son watches what appears is a red star in the distance . to everyone 's surprise it is a planet and one gets the impression a collision with our own planet is imminent . the second segment is more about claire . she is married to john , a wealthy man , whose generosity included the wedding celebration for justine . where justine is flighty , claire is a responsible woman . there are hints that justine 's instability must be some sort of mental problem that is not completely explained . the film kept reminding us certain aspects of alain resnais ' `` last year in marienbad '' . the film was beautifully photographed by manuel alberto . the music of wagner 's `` tristan and isolde '' is heard in the background and serves as the theme of this production .		6		1
warning **** mild spoilers **** i expected to enjoy this , i rarely catch a tony hopkins performance i do not like and also i avoid his obvious dogs like hannibal . nothing can save this script , and certainly not his weird almost wooden performance . i failed to see why the kid , bobby , liked him . i did not read the book and perhaps should , as it has to be better than this clunker which meanders and roams and seems overly stocked with cliches . i was particularly shocked at an adult rape scene intercut with an assault on a young girl and was lead to believe that the young girl was being raped also which was disturbing and further enforced by bobby carrying her a long distance . it turns out she was not raped but had a shoulder injury which left me puzzled on two fronts , -lrb- 1 -rrb- why was it intercut with a rape scene and -lrb- 2 -rrb- why did bobby have to carry her . i felt badly manipulated . also , is it just me or is david morse one of the most depressing actors around . i must have seen him in about 5 movies and everytime , no matter what the scene , he projects this incredible monochromatic sadness . a one theme actor like helen hunt , i guess . i do not like the easy transformation of one of the major characters , too slick , it would have worked better if she had stayed in character with the younger actor just accepting her as one of his first major lessons in life . ah well . 6 out of 10 .		6		1
how many films have you seen where a character whose spouse or significant other dies of supposingly explained causes but , out of love , the survivor digs to reveal the deception ? among such , do n't all melodramatically intensify the lost love relationship throughout the course of the `` investigation '' ? how many films are there they make big business or government the bogeyman , especially , as of late , the health care industry ? better than average acting , sets dialogue , etc. , thanks to the money advanced . credit to the emotional response , behavior of fiennes ' character in comparison to the quality of similar films . fault with the globe trotting , to spare resources of a modest civil servant . and why is a theme with so little time and no explanation devoted to the title 's suggestion ?		6		1
`` phone booth '' is a lean bubblegum thriller that knows its audience , and makes the most of its confined setting and split-screen images . the tension mounts respectably -lrb- the use of zooms , fisheye lenses , and different film stock complement the action -rrb- , and director joel schumacher , who has a bad reputation of mucking up his own films , curbs most of his heavy-handed tendencies -lrb- namely lots of neon and spectacle -rrb- . colin farrell 's big `` confession '' scene is the only moment where the movie smacks of melodramatic schmaltz . following in the footsteps of last year 's `` panic room , '' `` phone booth '' is another exercise in ` confined cinema ' that 's not as deep or endearing , but , at 80 minutes , passes quickly and is never dull . -lrb- one complaint : the opening sequence , which indulges in slo-mo , fast-forward , zooms , split screens , and an out-of-place voiceover narration , plays out like a commercial for at & t . i almost expected the disembodied voice to ask me to switch my long-distance service . -rrb- 6/10		6		1
this movie sets up a big surprise ending , that you figure out is going to happen well before it does , spoiling the surprise , really . a bunch of computer programmers create a virtual reality world based on 1937 . but the guy who owns the company that spends billions on a computer program that seems to serve no purpose leaves a note for his partner . except he leaves the note inside the computer program . except that one of the cgi characters reads it , realizes he 's a program . but really , the modern people are the programs . but if you die in the program , then the program character takes over your body . wow , can you guess how all of this is going to end . especially when you find out the guy who has been hijacking our character is a real , and the leading lady would rather knock boots with the simulation ...		6		1
do n't think too much when watching this movie . that 's my advice , but it worked as an excellent therapy right after surviving the horrendous local film return to pontianak . the covenant is guilty pleasure , of watching something full of effects , zero storyline to think about , great looking cast and the usual fast cars and quick action . alpha males will have another reason to rejoice , given the leading characters come from the so-called elite of the community , nicknamed `` the sons of ipswich '' for their founding fathers ' efforts in building the town they live in . all of them are your usual good looking hunky frat boys , with fast cars , and cute chicks in tow . however , our gang of four harbour a deep secret , that each of them have supernatural powers that they can use for whatever they want , and how they want . the only catch is that with each use of their powers , they will physically age . so , do you wan na trade good looks , for absolute power ? but of course , the book of damnation -lrb- gee -rrb- instills certain rules , and introduces the audience to hokey witchcraft and imagined mysticism . naturally no one 's interested in that stuff , except to watch with glee how our frat boys will -lrb- ab -rrb- use their powers . it 's addictive , you know , having such abilities , and given the mysticism added in , it 's no longer the drugs , nor the sex , nor the rock and roll that get these boys going , but the addiction of being omni - potent in place of power , wealth and fame . the leader of the pack , as per all juvenile stories , is the most powerful of the lot , and preaches time and time again on the virtues of restraint . until one day the team faces an unexplainable disturbance in the force -lrb- oops , wrong movie , but you get the drift -rrb- , and have to discover just exactly what the disturbance is . no honours will go towards acting abilities , and i feel those in the audience with strong sense of feminism will go up in arms about how the lead female character is portrayed . you know , the one who will go weak in the knees for the hottest looking guy and literally and blatantly flings herself at him . the guys too fare no better , always trying to ooze machismo and drip testosterone at every opportunity , and enjoy replicating leaping off rooftops . for a movie like this , there are no efforts spared in jazzing up the special effects . while on the whole it 's all good , there are portions of it which made scenes look like extended screen versions of the video game street fighter , and taking a leaf too from asia 's stormriders -lrb- feng yun -rrb- in creating battle scenes . you know it 's time for formula , when fights are choreographed according to an alternative rock soundtrack . while the action is good , the pacing of the movie could be improved loads . it could n't decide whether it wanted to be mysterious , horrific , reliant on action or wanting to take its romantic bits seriously . it seemed that director renny harlin had a lot of ideas for the feel of the movie , but could n't decide which to put focus on , and in the end , threw everything into the pot for a mix . it 's like an all boys `` the craft '' , also set in school , except that their powers are inherited , and the story examines what 's it like to use power with a price . if you need something to immerse yourself to forget about a hard day 's work , then the covenant probably is your choice . oh , and this is one movie in which the trailer tells the whole damn story .		6		1
i always thought these 2 were great on snl , and they are funny in this movie . fey plays , kate , successful middle age woman whom has yet to marry but wants a baby . after failing to conceive herself , she enlists the help of a surrogate mother service . sigourney weaver plays the owner of the service and her running gag is she is old yet still having babies . the other cameo is steve martin , kate 's boss , whom is a kooky , earthy , spiritual weirdo . poehler plays angie , the woman hired by the agency . angie has a loser boyfriend tom whom came up with the idea for her to be a surrogate . angie tells kate that the first try was a success , she 's pregnant . she leaves tom and moves in with kate . they soon become friends . but it turns out angie lied about being pregnant for the money . she feels bad about it now , but does n't know how to tell the truth . they go to a appointment and just as angie is about to tell the truth , the doctor finds a baby 's heart beat . so , then the question becomes : is the baby kate 's or angie and tom 's . along the way kate meets rob , and they go out a while . does kate get what she wants , a baby , one way or the other ? final verdict : it had some funny moments . i found it entertaining , and recommend it .		6		1
in california , the vp of marketing of the mickey 's fast food don anderson -lrb- greg kinnear -rrb- is responsible for the hamburger `` big one '' , the number one in selling in mickey 's chain of fast food restaurants . when an independent research in the meat patties produced in cody , colorado , indicates the presence of cow manure , don is sent to the facility to investigate possible irregularities in the meatpacking production plant and also the major supplier of cattle . along his surveys , don finds the truth about the process and how meat is contaminated . meanwhile , a group of illegal mexican immigrants arrive in cody to work in the dirty jobs in the plant while a group of activists plot how to expose the terrible situation of the mickey 's industry . `` fast food nation '' has a promising beginning , giving an expectation of a strong message against the fast food industry and the exploitation of illegal immigrants in usa . unfortunately in a certain moment the story becomes a shallow drama , losing the focus on the cattle of cows , people treated like cattle and the process of manufacturing industrialized meat , never going deeper in these issues . in this regard , `` super size me '' is much more effective , showing the effects of fast food in the human body . i believe this theme would be tailored for michael moore , and i did not like this work of richard linklater . there are many pointless cameo appearances of famous actors , like for example the characters of ethan hawke or bruce willis , maybe to show how popular this director is in hollywood . my vote is six . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` fast food '' -lrb- `` fast food nation '' -rrb-		6		1
the twenty year friendship between two young women in the early twentieth century american south is the focus of this 1991 film from director jon avnet . told in flashbacks , the story adopts a modern pov , with social empowerment being the theme . as such , the story is both unusual and unexpected , given its historical time frame . viewers will be disappointed if they expect a more traditional southern story ... about some dark , sinister secret emotionally repressed , and set among the lazy willows and old magnolia trees . empowerment can be a wonderful thing . but , if it is taken to extremes , as it is in two subplots , one involving frank bennett , and the other involving evelyn couch , then it can be a cause for concern . and that 's my main problem with this film . the subplots tend to lack credibility , although they do not detract from the overall character study of idgie and ruth . what was most impressive to me was the film 's atmospheric `` flavor '' . production design , set decoration , and costumes all sparkle with such vitality and detail , that you really feel like you 're back in the rural south of the 1920 's . most modern films pander to youth . to its everlasting credit , `` fried green tomatoes '' features the wisdom of an elderly character , played by jessica tandy , in a nursing home . an added bonus of the film is kathy bates , whose acting is always first-rate .		6		1
robert deniro gives a powerful , creepy turn as the wannabe king of comedy who wo n't take ` no ' for an answer from jerry langford , played by jerry lewis , surprisingly good as the embittered , pressured talkshow host . in the first half we see distinct sequences from rupert 's fantasies about taking over from jerry and marrying his schoolgirl crush barmaid , and the story naturally escalates as rupert becomes ever more desperate to get a spot on jerry 's show . he and masha , another stalker fan , kidnap jerry and blackmail rupert onto the show . this is where it breaks down . sandra bernhard simply does n't have the chops , even with the support of the two old troupers . she 's making such a meal of improvising it , her mouth churning dialogue to fill the void , it 's painful . jerry langford sits fuming , wrapped in duct tape as masha holds him prisoner , and you know how he feels . vary the tone , sandra ! anyway , rupert gets to do his turn , and is led away by the cops . the point about his cheesy act not actually bombing and making him a household name , with celebrity waiting for him after he leaves jail , is apposite today , with no-talent celebrities everywhere you look . what the script is saying is that fame is artificial , an illusion , and rupert manages to bust his way into the circuit - his talent , or lack of it , is irrelevant : the audience will take what it 's given . masha is left running around in her and we never see her again , and the payoff with rupert achieving his dream is a little flat . this is the sort of film you can watch again if you 've it - there 's plenty to enjoy in the sight gags and asides , but the story and sandra bernhard 's amateurish performance hole it below the waterline .		6		1
wwe remakes running man by mixing it with battle royal as a bunch of convicts are dumped on an island for fight to the death on pay per view . what could have been good action film flounders under uneven direction , i do n't mean the director is bad , i mean the film does n't know where it wants to go . is this a story of the people putting the show on or is it the convicts themselves . i do n't hate the film i 'm just disappointed in it if it had some sort of narrative vision . yes the action is good but its undercut by the rest of the film . worth a look when it plays cable or hits netflix .		6		1
i like director anthony hickox and i like the hellraiser movies so hellraiser iii : hell on earth has a lot in it 's favour , as far as i 'm concerned . sadly , there 's no denying that this was the movie that seemed to concentrate on turning pinhead into a freddy krueger type , a horror icon who has as many one-liners as he has ways to kill someone . the story is a rather simple one . the cenobites are trapped in a statue that club owner j.p. monroe -lrb- kevin bernhardt -rrb- buys for himself . a bit of blood later and we 're in familiar territory with chains and hooks and pleasurable pain for those who find themselves at the mercy of the agents of the puzzle box . reporter joanne summerskill -lrb- terry farrell -rrb- is , meanwhile , trying to make a name for herself with a newsworthy story . she 's also been having some strange dreams lately , dreams that may allow someone very important to male contact with her . this movie is not a very good one . the acting is almost consistently abysmal from everyone involved -lrb- though farrell does okay and doug bradley is very good -rrb- , the script by peter atkins limps from one set-piece to the next with many boring moments in between and the extra time devoted to the backstory of pinhead is something that many fans felt was unwarranted . pinhead was just pinhead - we found out that he 'd once been a man in the second movie but there was no need to delve further into detail . hickox directs all this competently enough but he 's hampered by the weak material -lrb- though this would be far from the worst of the series -rrb- . thankfully , he pulls out all of the stops for the moments of major carnage . the sequence of destruction that takes place in `` the boiler room '' is still impressive for it 's fx and nastiness . with some great gore , a touch of nudity and some creative new cenobites , this is n't a waste of time for fans of the first two movies but it 's worth bearing in mind that it takes the series almost into standard slasher fare as opposed to the crazy darkness of the first two films .		6		1
though some may consider it the `` be-all , end-all '' sci-fi flick , `` dark city '' -- while an interesting existential meditation on creation -- is a remarkably cold piece of work . granted , it 's a piece of work , brimming with intelligence and intrigue -lrb- probably the reason it bombed at the box office -rrb- , but its philosophy is unsupported by its characters who , no matter how integral to the plot , remain paper-thin ciphers from start to finish -lrb- making the main character an amnesiac should n't have exempted the screenwriters from throwing a few emotions into the role -rrb- . this is unfortunate , since `` dark city '' is a fine film on its own , with some good eye candy and interesting ideas : an alien race known as `` the strangers '' has created a world -lrb- with a heavy 1940s noir look -rrb- wherein they tinker with the identities of the inhabitants in an attempt to discover what , exactly , makes human beings such a unique breed ; they are also able to alter material reality through sheer will . richard o'brien -lrb- riff raff ! -rrb- stands out as a key stranger , but the humans are not quite earthbound -- with the exception of colin friels -lrb- another amnesiac -rrb- , who brings some much-needed , high-strung energy to the proceedings for a few minutes , bigger names like rufus sewell , jennifer connelly , and william hurt are left stranded in the mechanical script , while kiefer sutherland invokes quasimodo . as a mainstream entertainment , `` dark city '' does what is expected while clarifying as much as possible for the average film-goer -- however , i wound up wishing the emotional and intellectual aspects had been pushed further .		6		1
i left `` narnia '' feeling kind of cold . i loved the books as a child , and most specifically `` the lion , the witch and the wardrobe , '' which i read numerous times when i was young ... but no matter how faithful the adaptation is - story-wise - some elements do n't fit into place . i think it 's one of those books that is better off left as a book . the themes and actions that take place in c.s. lewis ' christian allegory do not translate well to the screen . i felt that something was off . the direction by andrew adamson -lrb- `` shrek '' -rrb- is commendable , but the second half of the movie is very bright , the animation throughout is quite poor -lrb- except for aslan -rrb- , and the final battle comes across as utterly silly . also , by squeezing the book into a two-hour movie whilst still retaining the essence of the novel , adamson 's film lacks cohesion . it all happens too fast . the characters are rather thin and i felt as if some scenes were handled poorly . for example , when edmund first meets the white witch -- if you were a young child who had just stumbled into a world inside a wardrobe , then told by a queen you were going to be the king , do n't you think it 'd be hard to conceal your excitement ? instead , edmund returns into the real world , and the only hint we get that he 's thinking about narnia is when a very poor exposition scene occurs with peter pointing out how edmund is sulking about . the course of action in the film is poorly developed as well . one minute they 're reluctant to fight , the next minute they 're armored up . the problem is that with a two-hour film like this , it 's hard to develop the characters . in a novel , it 's easier - the general narratives of novels make us feel more attached to the characters . watching them is much different - and it 's hard to take their decision to join narnia 's battle against the white witch very seriously at all . also , maybe i was the only one who noticed that young georgie henley -lrb- who plays lucy -rrb- was always smiling . not just a happy smile , though . a wicked smile , like she 's just played a trick on somebody and ready to savor the revenge . it 's kind of creepy . when she cries at the end , it still looked like she was ready to stab someone in the back and break into a maniacal laugh . am i being harsh ? probably a bit too much , yes . it 's just that coming from a who loved this particular book years ago , i feel the adaptation as a whole is simply mediocre . i felt from the characters , i thought the animation was poor , some scenes were handled poorly , and the final battle was a joke . overall , it 's worth seeing if you like the book -lrb- s -rrb- . i was personally disappointed by the film , but it seems - judging from its imdb rating - most people were n't . hopefully the sequel will be better .		6		1
i appreciate the initiative from the film new in town for trying to add a slight social commentary about the effects the worldwide economical crisis produced on the lives of workers who suffer the close of factories in order to keeping the earnings of huge companies , to a simple romantic let 's not get depressed ... after all , reneé zellweger 's character falls in love ! new in town is a mediocre movie ... it is not very good , but it is not bad and it kept me moderately entertained . zellweger 's performance lacks of any enthusiasm , energy or credibility , but the rest of the actors bring a competent work , from harry connick jr. as her love interest to the brilliant j.k. simmons as the foreman from a factory , without forgetting siobhan fallon on a performance which reminded me a little bit of the one made by frances mcdormand on in town does not have the subtle sense of humor from that movie , but it explores the characteristic accents from the region , the cold grasslands and the funny hats used because of the intense cold on a more or less sympathetic , although this movie has various clichés , it also avoids falling on various ones . the main problems from this movie are that the comedy should have been funnier and that the romance is not very credible . i did not like new in town very much , but i have to recognize that i do not belong to the kind of spectators it was made , i will give it a slight recommendation because despite being mediocre , it kept me moderately if you wan na watch an excellent romantic comedy starring zellweger , i recommend you bridget jones ' diary and down with love .		6		1

scabrous political satirist bill maher states that 16 % of the country identify themselves as secular humanists who do n't believe in god . it is to this group which he targets with this 2008 diatribe against organized religion . in the process , maher actually makes michael moore appear comparatively subtle and fair-minded when it comes to making provocative documentaries . there is a passing similarity to approach with moore 's `` fahrenheit 911 '' and `` sicko '' , but the tone here reflects even greater hubris and more outward comedy given the polarizing subject . the tone should come as no surprise since maher recruited larry charles to direct , the man who helmed the fish-out-of-water mockumentary hit `` borat '' and several episodes of hbo 's `` curb your enthusiasm '' . like the set-up of `` borat '' , this film has maher talking to regular people and making fun of them in alternately clever and condescending ways . to some degree , it 's difficult to watch the film without feeling sorry for these poor individuals who just happened to have stumbled in front of the camera . what offsets the attitude is maher 's dead-serious intent in spreading the gospel of doubt . the film follows him on a globetrotting series of interviews with various representatives of the western religious faiths - the vatican , the holy land , salt lake city where the mormon church is headquartered , a christian-themed amusement park in orlando , and even a truckers ' church in the bible belt . maher even interviews his own mother in the catholic church he attended as a child in order to discuss why he did n't find out she was jewish until his teen years . some of the brief segments are quite entertaining like the no-nonsense opinions expressed by father reginald foster , a catholic priest , senior vatican scholar and the pope 's principal . others are subject of justified derision like josé luis de jesús miranda , the pompous founder of an international ministry in miami , and pastor jerry cummings , a former member of harold melvin & the blue notes and the leader of the amazing life world outreach congregation in north carolina . probably the most intriguing person interviewed is senator mark pryor -lrb- -rrb- , an avowed creationist who calmly defends his beliefs to maher 's constant haranguing by admitting that `` you do n't have to pass an iq test to be in the senate '' . for the most part , maher lets his subjects talk freely but ultimately forces them to answer why they hold onto beliefs that can not be proved empirically . much like his hbo show , `` real time with bill maher '' , he talks plainly and fearlessly ; but unlike his show where he parries with celebrity pundits of equal or greater stature , he receives responses that range from indifference to anger to a complete shutdown in acknowledging maher 's way of thinking . the latter holds especially true in a scene with a fundamentalist , a formerly gay man married to a former lesbian and now dedicated to converting gays . this approach also points to the film 's biggest drawback , that maher did n't choose subjects who could engage him in a more spirited debate that could make him reconsider his position if only for a single scene . the use of old footage from the movies works intermittently as comic relief between the sometimes heavy-handed interviews , but i think maher and charles could have done without them . even less necessary is maher 's angry closing monologue about the dangers of mixing religion and politics since he loses his sense of humor to underline his seriousness about this topic . this documentary feature is a worthwhile viewing experience but just falls short as a thoughtful rebuke against organized religion .		6		1
willard is a movie that does n't really fall into a specific category . do n't expect a traditional horror , but do n't expect a b horror comedy either . if anything , it 's a very morbid drama . there are some good characters in it that you end up caring for . crispin glover does a perfect job as willard , it 's his best performance yet , and r. lee is great in the over-the-top role of willard 's boss . but what i found most surprising is how much you actually end up caring for the rats . the 2 lead rats even seem to have personalities . there are some creepy scenes but nothing that will keep you up at night . it 's a fairly predictable movie - you know from his very first scene that willard 's boss is going to get it . but that does n't matter , the movie 's entertaining and interesting , and that 's enough . the end leaves a door open for a sequel , and i say bring it on . i 'd like to see another willard . this is destined to be a cult classic . a movie about a guy and a bunch of rats is n't likely to become a world-wide hit , but i think this will be more popular on video . it 's good late night movie . my rating : 6/10		6		1
filmed 1999 , `` d-tox '' aka `` eye see you '' would not be release until three years later in a short-lived theatrical release . there it went by without much of mark and its reputation was no better . despite that , i did n't find it to be all that bad even though it does have its issues namely its tepid script . still there 's a strong cast to tag along -lrb- sylvester stallone , charles s. dutton , kris kristofferson , tom berenger , polly walker , robert patrick , stephen lang , robert prosky , christopher fulford and jeffery wright -rrb- and the choice of setting -lrb- a hospital in the snowy backwoods -rrb- made sure the claustrophobic tension and sombre atmospherics was sustained . fbi agent mark malloy is on the case of a serial killer randomly murdering cops with little to no clues to catching this guy , but things take a sudden turn for the worse . when tragedy hits home thanks to the killer taking a fancy to his wife , this leaves malloy to hit the bottle and finally attempt suicide . fellow agent / friend hendricks signs malloy up to a rehab clinic in alaska that 's run by an ex-cop for burnt-out officers fighting their demons . although the worrying thing is that malloy soon discovers that the killer has followed him there . this is a textbook , but engagingly dark slow-grinding mystery thriller with a tight ten little indians formula with slasher elements balanced out by psychological friction . director jim gillespie -lrb- who made the 90s slasher `` i know what you did last summer '' -rrb- keeps it bleak , adding numerous unpleasant details and drawing up a paranoid air where he puts the cat amongst the pigeons . the script throws around red herrings , but lets things unfold in a rather convenient manner and leaves open plot holes . stallone is fitting enough in his down-trodden , scared lead performance . kristofferson is solid , as is and also walker . but it is dutton and especially patrick who stand out from the lot . `` d-tox '' might not be a hard habit to kick , but it remains passably brooding entertainment . `` the real bad things in life make you stronger .

confessions of a dangerous mind -lrb- 2002 -rrb- like the better known george clooney directed film , good night , and good luck , this one is about the early days of television . but the similarity ends there . filmed in color , with a second story about the cia , and sometimes inventive filming moving from one space to another freely , or showing fantasies that get confused with the truth . confessions almost feels like a crazy dream . and a good one , an interesting tour of a man 's off-kilter mind finding escapes in brilliant flashes of success . and the writing is by the great charlie kaufman , which is reason enough to get involved . the period is great -lrb- 1960s and 70s -rrb- , laced with the cold war and peripheral drug use , and lots of bright colors . `` the dating game '' gets started on t.v. sets and then suddenly we see a gruesome assassination , making for a wild ride . and there is a star-studded cast , with julia roberts prominent and brad pitt and matt damon definitely not prominent -lrb- but their two seconds making maybe the best single moment in the movie -rrb- . the intrigue compounds when our leading man , a very non-fictional chuck barris , becomes a target himself . the lead , sam rockwell , has the problem for me of not creating a sympathetic character , so when things go wrong , and even when things go right , he seems like a jerk , and i could n't quite get absorbed in it . instead , everything just `` happens . '' but such things ! could they be true ? the movie is based on barris 's autobiography of the same name , and yet the cia denies barris had anything to do with them . good stuff for a surreal , bouncy movie , anyway . no strait jacket required .		7		1
you know , this film aint too bad at all ! this is an entertaining horror flick that returns to the quality of the first film and away from the pure drivel of the second movie . this is set in the past and we see the vampire club as it was in the past . like the first movie in this we see no monster action for the first half and pure blood sucking gore for the entire second half of the film . this not to say the first half is poor because it is n't . again like the first movie the first half is different yet very watchable . the acting is very good and the special affect are ok if not story is hardly ground breaking but at times this is very funny and in the moments when it was supposed to be , not like in the second movie when it was funny when they were trying to be serious ! an above average horror that is hard not to like . 7 out of 10 .		7		1
casey affleck as deputy sheriff lou ford had some old business to take care of . an encounter with a prostitute -lrb- jessica alba -rrb- gave him a chance to use her for a few months before he used her to get back at the , using son elmer -lrb- jay r. ferguson -rrb- to get to dad chester -lrb- ned beatty -rrb- . trouble is , he finds he likes what he did to those two . however , he was n't as smart as he thought he was . the sheriff -lrb- tom bower -rrb- knew , the da -lrb- simon baker -rrb- knew , the union boss -lrb- elias koteas -rrb- knew , and another deputy -lrb- matthew maher -rrb- knew . even his girlfriend -lrb- kate hudson -rrb- knew . how was he going to get out of this ? if chester conway knew , he was n't . what an ending ! casey affleck was great .		7		1
`` the illusionist '' -lrb- 2006 -rrb- is a very beautiful film i suggest with a splendidly attractive surface that founders on only one vital point , the impossibility of the illusions created and being used by its central character to bring down a tyrant . neil burger has directed this film in classical and intelligent style , never striving for sensational effect and getting the very most out of his cast . the story altogether i assert was developed from a ` short story ' from steven millhauser `` eisenheim the illusionist '' , by the director . as is the case with too many films of recent vintage , including `` you 've got mail '' , `` devil with a blue dress '' and dozens of others , the fundamental key to the film 's was never discovered . this leaves the viewer with a very rich-looking fantasy about the hapsburg empire 's leadership class and its tendency toward totalitarianism and emotional instability . the subplot concerns the crown prince leopold 's bad character , that leads him to a desire to overthrow the emperor . but the piece 's main plot concerns the love of a man , now an world-class illusionist , for the duchess who was his first love and is also the marital key to the crown prince 's nefarious plan . this effort 's dozen producers have achieved a surprisingly effective and sustained `` look '' , in my judgment , through the use of horse-drawn vehicles and major buildings of the late 1800s -- two theaters , a palace , a large house , a railway station and several streets , as well as attractive outdoor settings . for this unity of design , cinematographer dick pope , production designer ondrej , art stefan and vlasta , set decorator petra and costume designer dickson all deserve high credit . philip glass 's music never makes a complete point but it is lush and unobtrusively applied to the gorgeous tapestry of this period romance cum mystery , in my opinion . in the realm of acting , which for any costume film is so central to successful believability 's being achieved by any filmmaker , the curious lack of development of characters at once makes the casting of players easier but also their best efforts . they are , in effect , too-often reduced by this failing to two or three lines , in one scene or two . this lack i suggest is partly due to the failure of the adapter to develop the original story beyond its two lovers and two opponents ; but it is also a result of the secretive nature of all three characters , none of whom is able to confine in anyone . among the supporting cast , robert russel as a spiritualist leader and young elias bauer as a messenger are given noticeable one-scene roles . others having meaningful parts included aaron johnson and eleanor tomlinson as the youthful friends destined to be lovers , karl johnson as the doctor , and others who are given two or three lines here or there , which seem surprisingly performed well in all cases . there are even theatrical , crowd and street scenes of impressive attractiveness and utility . as the crown prince , the mad leopold , rufus sewell , works hard but is sometimes out of his depth in a part demanding a classical training . the same must be said for edward norton . his intelligence and theatrical competence allow him to execute the speeches adequately or better ; but much of the time he appears to be a merely thin and somewhat gangling character actor unable to find an approach to playing a charismatic leader of men ; he is not helped by having no confidant to play off throughout most of the film , which leaves him often standing alone in large rooms and being questioned by others . jessica biel is sincere and lovely as the duchess sophie ; all she lacks is a stage-trained voice to be added to all her other impressive credentials . so , i claim , it falls to narrator and police inspector paul giamatti to carry the film . this , i argue , he does in splendid oscarworthy fashion from beginning to end . he alone in the cast is given a variety of moods as well as scenes to play ; and the strength of the film 's logic and his own success at achieving the effect the director desires are perhaps the project 's greatest strengths . it should be noted that the narrative is not swift-paced but is nevertheless very satisfying throughout , even in scenes that in lesser hands might have slowed up the progress of the work . with a great leading man , such as the story deserved , and a solution to the believability of the illusions being depicted , which are so powerful they mystify an empire 's best minds , the film might have achieved much more even than it did . what results , i argue , is an unusually handsome and cinematic story , a near-classic well worth the seeing more than once , if only for its economy of means and unusual physical beauty .		7		1
hot fuzz is one of those films that creates a love/hate relationship with most people . those that do n't ` get it ' will no doubt hate it but those that like films like this and pretty much use films like this as a cut off point for their further filmic viewing will love it . i have to admit that i am veering more towards the ` hate it ' category as i 've seen rather a large amount of films and can honestly say close to brainless , all action and comedic films like this are only fun every once in a while . i do , however , think it 's fantastic to see britain produce films like this and shaun of the dead given the state of affairs hollywood is in what with all the sequels and remakes that are being made and what better way to make it big in the states by spoofing those action films americans have become all too associated with . hot fuzz is really just a stab ; it 's a stab at many things . these can include minor stabs at small town police forces or full blown stabs at films that rely on ridiculous , over the top action scenes ; two of which are mentioned in this film anyway -lrb- point break and bad boys 2 -rrb- and two of which are referenced very cleverly to boot . also , if you 've never been a member of the police force or have never been in a small police station , who knows what goes on inside ? the fact the station has its own ` swear jar ' and a riot gear storage cupboard that is covered in cobwebs through disuse is absolutely hilarious , as is the relaxed approach all the officers have . i especially liked the head of the cctv thinking he had a very important job to do when really , nothing criminal happens so there 's no need for him to even be there . another clever convention that the writers included and at well spaced times was the emphasis on seemingly meaningless jobs . so many times do we see focus on nicholas angel -lrb- pegg -rrb- having to deal with insignificant tasks such as recovering a lost swan or having to deal with a church fete yet they are still moulded into the plot somehow in a clever and entertaining way . if shaun of the dead was a parody of zombie films then like i said earlier , hot fuzz is a parody of hollywood action films . the scene when danny butterman -lrb- frost -rrb- shoots uncontrollably into the air from a lying position and when the chopper flies overhead in slow motion as danny and angel emerge from the wreckage are two scenes straight out of point break -lrb- 1991 -rrb- and bad boys ii -lrb- 2003 -rrb- , respectively ; both of which , when they eventually occur are fantastic to watch in an oddly surreal way . on top of this , towards the end the film seems to cleverly flick between reality and fantasy . the scene in question is when after spoofing so many films in an ultra unrealistic way , the film has the audacity to turn down the chance to use a one liner and this is mentioned by danny to angel who replies back something like `` no , that 's only in the movies . '' very funny yet playful with the testing of realism at the same time . what hot fuzz lacks for in brains , it makes up for in style as it cleverly switches from opening like a dramatic , cop thriller before turning to an episode of ` inspector morse ' , before morphing again into bad boys ii and then completing its transformation when it finishes like the wicker man -lrb- 1973 -rrb- . some jokes however do n't work , especially the character of simon skinner -lrb- dalton -rrb- . his constant references to decapitation get very tiresome very quickly and might just as well walk around with a placard saying : ` here , i 'm the bad guy ' but this is cleverly played with later on as we assume the writers take us all for mugs . on the whole , if you can look past the things that make hot fuzz look more like an hour and a half long spoof show , you 'll find a funny and at times engaging film that despite its flaws will pass the time very easily .		7		1
in spite of some bad reviews i decided to watch this because i thought it would be more like sandler 's one good movie , the wedding singer , and my instincts were right . this does have much of the same tone as that movie , although it 's marred by some of the that makes most sandler movies intolerable . i like the premise , which falls somewhere between groundhog 's day and clean slate , as sandler has to make a girl with short term memory loss in love with him every day . while i find it hard to accept sandler as a lady 's man -lrb- i also find it hard to accept him as a phenomenally successful actor , so i guess i 'm out of sync with the american public -rrb- , he and barrymore have a good chemistry that makes it work . what keeps this film from working as well as wedding singer is the aforementioned , represented by ula , who seems to fall into the category of , `` if someone 's really ugly and has a weird accent then they should be ridiculed '' and pathetic bodybuilder doug . these characters feel completely out of place amidst the movie 's low-key charm , as though they wandered in from one of sandler 's low comedies . there is something generally unfocused about the movie . it can also be seen in an odd throwaway shot of the auto accent , which adds absolutely nothing to the movie , like the character of ula . wedding singer had a very definite vision of what it was going for and dates suffers from a lack of that vision . but it is moderately amusing and rather sweet , so all in all it 's a good movie . 7/10		7		1
for sheer magnificence of the sets , costumes , action scenes thrown together with vigor and a good bit of humor , pirates of the caribbean : at world 's end is best enjoyed by not paying too much attention to the intricate plot . it seems that everyone has a personal history or agenda that 's the exact opposite of the other , so at times the confusion is mind-numbing if you pay too much attention to the plot line . but it 's sheer fun as a summer blockbuster with the further exploits of jack sparrow , played to the hilt by johnny depp with a devilish gleam in his eyes . and the rest of the cast is perfect , all of them fully a part of the scheme of things by now and knowing exactly what their function is -- or so it seems . keira knightley is more beautiful than ever as the feisty heroine elizabeth swann and is given much more to do . orlando bloom is back as will turner with significantly less to do but he looks good doing it . and you ca n't find better character acting than that provided by chow yun fat as captain sao feng , brilliant in the singapore scenes , stellan skarsgard as bill turner , kevin r. mcnally as gibbs -- and most particularly bill nighy as davey jones , hidden facially by gigantic tentacles that are just one of the many cgi ingredients . still , behind all that make-up , he does a fantastic job . i enjoyed it twice as much as the second installment although it is quite a bit lengthier . but there 's so much to see , so much action and so many strikingly beautiful visual scenes to gaze at that it 's hard to take it all in at one sitting . if you 're in the mood for a tale with plenty of swashbuckling adventures told with quirky originality , this is it . and once again , johnny depp gets all of the humor and eccentricities out of jack sparrow that he possibly can . he 's terrific . summing up : cap it all up with hans zimmer 's glorious score and you have a real good summer blockbuster .		7		1
though not as good as the original , the return of the seven brings back yul brynner for another appealing turn as black-clad anti-hero chris adams , with claude akins and warren oates providing memorable support . however , the rest of the seven are kind of bland , but alright . burt kennedy was one of the best and least heralded directors that the western genre has to offer . here , he does n't disappoint , filling the screen with the type of excellent screen composition that his old collaborator budd boetticher was known for and from whom he no doubt learned to direct . the afore mentioned direction , good production values , and exciting action sequences , as well as the performances of brynner , oates , akins and emilio fernandez all help make up for the slow spots in the script . speaking of warren oates , the same year he also starred in the western the shooting . such a great actor he is , that oates does n't even seem like the same person in both movies ! three years later , he and villain fernandez were opposite each other again in the wild bunch .		7		1
greetings again from the darkness . another in a line of movie versions for comic book characters . for the most part these have been handled pretty well . `` the hulk '' is no exception . far from perfect , very adult , but mostly watchable . director ang lee -lrb- who crafted the mesmerizing `` crouching tiger , hidden dragon '' -rrb- provides us with a dark , , cgi overloaded film that will not have you smiling or chuckling , but if you are over 18 , you will find the story a bit unsettling . the story dwells on bruce banner 's -lrb- played fine by hunk , eric bana -rrb- mysterious father -lrb- nick nolte -rrb- and the testing that occurred when bruce was under 4 years of age . bruce , of course , unwittingly follows in his mad scientist father 's footsteps and ends up in a lab with the gorgeous jennifer connelly - we should all be so lucky . note : if you have never seen it , make sure you check out connelly in `` the hot spot '' from 1990 - it 's a gem . the story takes off when banner 's dad reappears after 30 years with a couple of `` unstable '' . the film does deliver the necessary hulk action , although at times the picture is muddled and it is difficult to tell what is happening . my biggest problem with the film is ang lee 's attempt at creative filmmaking using the worthless split screen imaging and an of close-ups . on the other hand , nolte 's performance , connelly 's face , sam elliott 's snarling and danny elfman 's score make this a winner . the casting was brilliant for the young nolte and elliott characters . and do n't miss lou ferrigno -lrb- the hulk -rrb- and stan lee -lrb- creator of `` the hulk '' and `` spiderman '' -rrb- walking out of a building together early in the movie .		7		1
attractive blonde monica vitti -lrb- as claudia -rrb- and her best friend 's lover gabriele ferzetti -lrb- as sandro -rrb- are drawn to each other , after the disappearance of the latter 's dark-haired girlfriend lea massari -lrb- as anna -rrb- , on a mediterranean cruise . the vanishing woman symbolically transfers her affections , especially by letting ms. vitti know she looks better in a shirt while the women are changing . telling a fishy story about sharks in the water reveals ms. massari is not trustworthy . announcing her departure after a quarrel , massari pulls a garbo after telling mr. ferzetti , `` i want to be alone . '' he did n't seem interested in commitment . there is less mystery than meets the eye as massari simply hops on a boat while everyone languishes on a rocky , volcanic island ... apparently ... as the film goes on , characters -lrb- and viewers -rrb- doubt that scenario . michelangelo antonioni existential `` '' wants to leave you adrift . the film is very slow-moving , and it is not helped by the discipline and surrealism evident in the mr. antonioni 's later films . however , it is artfully directed ; and the performances , photography by aldo and soundtrack by giovanni fusco are excellent . antonioni should have ended with the disappearance of ferzetti . the `` story '' is `` complete '' -lrb- it is not the story of massari 's disappearance -rrb- , but a much more powerful one could have been told . imagine an ending where ferzetti simply disappears from the picture , leaving vitti alone and - by extension - leaving viewers deserted . this would take the story to the ultimate - we all end alone . here 's how : the final act gives ferzetti some of his best acting moments ; so , to preserve ferzetti 's dalliance with the other woman , move it forward to occur earlier . then , vitti forgives him . cut the final `` i love you '' as ferzetti leaves vitti in bed . we do not see him again . in all the final scenes , subtract ferzetti . vitti still runs around the film 's landscape , but she is alone . ******* l'avventura -lrb- -rrb- michelangelo antonioni ~ monica vitti , gabriele ferzetti , lea massari , dominique blanchar		7		1
i found this film infectiously funny and entertaining . adam sandler can be a bit hit & miss for me but here he is perfect , as is the lovely jennifer aniston , starting out as his homely lab assistant and then turning out all glammed up and as beautiful as we all know that she can be . most enticing though , is model brooklyn decker , who is ravishing in every scene that she is in and soon is danny 's -lrb- sandler -rrb- younger than he girlfriend . danny is a successful l.a. plastic surgeon but still resorts to shady tactics to bed his dates . this tactic backfires with palmer -lrb- decker -rrb- and so a plan involving katherine -lrb- aniston -rrb- to pose as his soon-to-be divorced wife is hatched . plus her real , currently fatherless two children -lrb- who are great ! -rrb- . the girl pretends to speak a mixture of cockney and `` royal '' english which is very funny and the boy wants to swim with dolphins - but can not swim . the inclusion on the holiday of nicole kidman almost took things too far but they all bounced off each other well and there are some great scenes with just the three leads . yes , it is contrived nonsense most of the time , including a ridiculous german-accented pretend husband -lrb- who sells sheep online for a living -rrb- for katherine and a holiday to hawaii . but this mixture of exotic locations , fun , slight sauciness and banter -lrb- plus some glamour -rrb- make for a heady mix of great entertainment . i almost want to see it again ...		7		1
teeth has terrible taste , and yet when it 's over you still want more of what it offers . i guess that is the movie 's sole problem , it feels too short , either that or it is slightly under written . when it ended , it felt like there room room for another fifteen to twenty minutes of fun material to be milked from this surprisingly inventive idea . i was still satisfied though . teeth flirts with the urban myth of vagina dentata , or vaginal teeth . these teeth are inside dawn o'keefe who takes pride in being a virgin , even though she is kind of drawn to the new boy in school . there is an extreme sense of guilty pleasure generated from watching two or three dis likable young men get what they deserve , in loosing their ding dongs . it is both horrific and comedic , which it intends to be , but somehow it is not ` quite ' enough . as perverted as it may sound , we are left wanting a bit more . but of course nothing is perfect . teeth turns out to be pretty good for it 's type , not many black comedies are as inventive as this one .		7		1
`` changeling '' begins with the old-fashioned universal pictures logo and it really sets up what 's to come . if this story were set today , a dna test could have ended this movie in 5 minutes but it 's set during the late 1920 's , which makes it a complicated mess worthy of being unraveled by a big hollywood movie . the film is based , unbelievably , on a true story about a los angeles woman who loses her son . the lapd finds who they believe to be him , but its not him . it 's a strange story and in less competent hands it could have gone way off track but clint eastwood is at the helm and a fantastic cast including angelina jolie and john malkovich are out right in front . `` changeling '' is dense and twisty but it remains interesting nonetheless . jolie plays christine collins , a switchboard supervisor who comes home one day to find that her 9-year old son walter is missing . it 's during this time that the lapd is already under constant scrutiny for its corruption and incompetence , even being the focus of sermons given by pastor and radio evangelist gustav briegleb -lrb- john malkovich -rrb- . christine is about to get a good look at how they do business when she gets a call that her son has been found . only when arriving at a train station to see him , she knows immediately that the boy is an imposter . this leads to many verbal sparring matches between her and capt. j.j. jones -lrb- jeffrey donovan -rrb- and to police reports in the newspaper that christine is neurotic and an unfit mother . jones even goes so far as to throw her in a mental institution , where more police corruption is revealed to her by an inmate -lrb- amy ryan -rrb- . her only support comes from the pastor and from one good cop investigating murders committed by a serial killer -lrb- jason butler harner -rrb- at a ranch . the movie is more of a chronicle than an emotional journey . it takes us down one path only to yank us down another one later on , going from the sad loss of a son , to a ludicrously shocking display of how the police use their power , to the grisly and disturbing murders committed at the ranch , and finally to the inevitable trials and calls for justice . this movie has a lot to cover and really does n't spend much time trying to pull at the heartstrings in between . the timeline of events is shocking , ugly and is pretty much guaranteed to leave you fascinated and disturbed just i wish the story stopped every once in a while to dive into character psyches . but regardless , i liked the sort-of chess match being played between collins and the police , her move being the constant evidence against this boy being her son and theirs being the laughably awful explanations to the contrary , my favorite being that shock can lead to `` spine shrinkage . '' and again this is an uncomfortable yet probing film from eastwood about the evil that men can do and if you can handle it there is a lot worth watching here . eastwood 's film is also very authentic . the cars , big red trains and drab looking costumes all look very 1920 's . and amid all this background and design is angelina jolie , one of those old-fashioned ava beauties who seems to fit into everything like a glove . there has n't been a lot of talk concerning the best actress race this year but that should change with jolie , who fills the character with fight , determination , and a strong sense of hope . her best quality though is that she brings a restrained dignity to the role , never falling into a melodramatic trap once . malkovich is phenomenal , providing us with a character whose rock-solid both in his intelligence and in his resolve . and the villains also shine , jeffrey donovan giving a slick and slimy performance while jason butler harner makes for a disgustingly pathetic and sick human being . `` changeling '' works as a report . it 's more of a this happened , this happened , then this happened type of movie , with the characters going through motions . but that 's really the only thing that keeps the movie from being really exceptional . the cast does fine work and fills the emotional holes the best they can and eastwood again makes a compelling movie about the evil in the hearts of men . `` changeling '' could have been better but it 's good nonetheless .		7		1
`` mirror mirror '' reinterprets the snow white legend as a whimsical , lighthearted comedy appropriate for the whole family . some will inevitably be turned off by this approach , but i found it to be quite pleasant and entertaining . it certainly is easy on the eyes ; directed by tarsem singh , known for his beautifully offbeat visuals , the film is a triumph of art direction , set decoration , and costume design . the latter is especially prominent . all of the characters are adorned in bold and colorful garments , some flowing and beautiful , others unique and eccentric , all strangely and unexplainably . costume designer eiko ishioka , who died in january at the age of seventy-three , may be deserving of a posthumous academy award nomination for her efforts . all the familiar characters are there , and although the comedy has been amped up , they 're developed more or less as we expect them to be . there 's snow white -lrb- lily collins -rrb- , who possesses all the lyrical physical characteristics -lrb- pale skin , black hair , red lips -rrb- and radiates a naïve , virginal purity that 's nothing short of adorable . there 's her stepmother , the queen -lrb- julia roberts -rrb- , and although her jealousy and cruelty may not be as harsh as they are in darker adaptations , she 's very much a wicked woman . there 's the prince , here named -lrb- armie hammer -rrb- , who is indeed handsome and brave , if ever so slightly dimwitted . and then , of course , there are the seven dwarfs , a ragtag band of pint-sized marauders who live in a hollow tree . do n't go in expecting the names synonymous with disney ; this time around , they 're given names like wolf , chuckles , and grimm -lrb- an obvious ode to the brothers grimm -rrb- . there are several new characters , the most notable being the queen 's personal valet , brighton -lrb- nathan lane -rrb- . naturally , much of the queen 's frustrations are taken out on him , and he takes it with a great deal of fear and just a hint of biting sarcasm . all of the characters are given their fair share of jokes , but he 's essentially the comedy relief ; at one point , he 's punished by being turned into a cockroach . the dwarfs also serve as comedy relief , although they 're also portrayed in a very sympathetic light , even when they rob a stranger passing through the forest . we learn that , after the queen claimed the crown , she decreed that all `` undesirables '' be cast out of the kingdom . these seven men fell into this category when no one would speak on their behalf . it 's a shame too , seeing as , at one time , they all had respectable jobs . although the underlying concept of a jealous queen imprisoning her beautiful stepdaughter remains , many liberties are taken with the overall plot . the queen , desiring to be the fairest one of all , greedily taxes the people of the kingdom to finance opulent parties and numerous beauty regiments . as she tries to keep her orphaned stepdaughter away from the throne , she sets her sights on marrying prince , whose riches would surely solve her financial problems . the problem , of course , is that is besotted by snow white . the queen orders brighton to murder the young maiden in the forest , but he finds he can not bring himself to do it . she runs away and is soon introduced to the dwarfs , most of whom quickly decide they like her a great deal . snow white , meanwhile , has finally gotten a firsthand look at the villagers , who have been so heavily taxed that they live in a state of dickensian despair . with the help of the dwarfs , who were little more than desperate bandits , she vows to set things right . her mission to stop the queen and win the affections of , now under a puppy-love spell , allows for several exciting and fun action sequences . these would include a training montage , a swordfight with gigantic wooden sketch dolls controlled by puppet strings , and a climactic encounter with a widely dreaded forest beast -- the same one that in all likelihood killed her father , the king , ten years earlier and plunged the world into a never-ending winter . the film has a bright storybook look about it , which is appropriate given its fairytale origins . the main castle , for example , rests impossibly on a precipice jutting up from the middle of a lake . and then there 's the queen 's mirror , which in this case is n't a mirror at all but rather a portal to a hut in the middle of an otherworldly lake . the mood is fittingly set by composer alan menken , who may not have been solely responsible for the disney renaissance but certainly had a big hand in making it happen . the only ill-fitting element of `` mirror mirror '' is a bollywood-style musical sequence played during the end credits -- included , i suspect , as a way for tarsem to get back in touch with his indian roots . but overall , the film is lightweight , pleasant , and exuberant fun . -- chris pandolfi -lrb- www.atatheaternearyou.net -rrb-		7		1
this is a typical french drama , which means you 'll have to wait for the inevitable of course ; but on the other hand , if you 're use to this genre , you may not expect the inevitable to occur . it does . there , i just spoiled it ; you were warned . if you are a jacques audiard fan , as i am , you will not be disappointed . each film directed by the man has rewarded my expectations . carla , played by emmanuelle devos , is a near totally deaf employee at a major construction and development firm where only her supervisor appears to have noticed her talent and dedication , whereas her co-workers see her with a different and biased eye . she manages with a hearing aid and by putting in more work than anyone else . her boss recognizing this assigns her an intern , which she can pick herself . she picks paul , an ex-convict , played by fame international star vincent cassel ; i assumed the character of carla was sympathetic to underdog paul for obvious reasons , but i realized soon enough it was because he took her seriously and felt some degree of gratitude when she goes beyond what he expected and finds him accommodations on top of making sure he keeps his job . paul has a much different outlook on life . when he notices she reads lips , he puts two and two together and sees the potential for spying on a gang of criminals who he wants to rip-off . he convinces her to do this for him and she very reluctantly obliges , having developed for him feelings , not reciprocated until the very end of the movie . the caper does not go all that well and almost fails ; were it not for carla putting herself at risk to get paul what he wanted , he would have not only lost his chance , but also his life . that was all that was needed for him to wake up to the love of the woman meant for him . i 'm just a sucker for those kinds of movies and if you liked my synopsis , you 'll like the movie .		7		1
that sentiment sums up the frustration and disappointment of joan crawford about her love for and obsession with violin virtuoso john garfield in an excellent film blessed with great acting and beautiful music . crawford and garfield are well-matched in this movie , as crawford becomes garfield 's patron and gives his career a financial boost but becomes hopelessly drawn to her protégé as his concert career takes off . the two principals circle each other warily , sizing up the other and lashing out verbally with accusations of ingratitude and selfishness with garfield holding fast to his dedication to his music while crawford begins a slow but steady decline into drinking and depression . garfield 's tunnel vision concerning his instrument does not allow him to appreciate the love a young woman has for him , nor can he grasp his mother 's sage counsel and warning about his involvement with a married woman . the film has generous servings of music by , dvorak , lalo and a brief but excellent recital of franz waxman 's adaptation of `` carmen '' .		7		1
attempting to parody the work of such former as steven segal and chuck norris is , on paper , such a redundant task , since most of those so-bad-they 're - action shoot-em-ups of the late 80s and early 90s were already teetering on the brink of . so how then , does hott fuzz , the new film from the makers of shaun of the dead -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , overcome a potential damp squib ? the story goes like this : dedicated london cop nicholas -lrb- pegg -rrb- , with a near perfect arrest record , is transferred to a small countryside village , where the crime rate is so excruciatingly low , that our hapless hero is reduced to being assigned to arresting the human statue in the town centre for loitering . all appears well , that is , until a series of grisly deaths appear to pile up around town , all of which are strangely linked to business entrepreneur simon skinner -lrb- dalton -rrb- . although continuously suspects the worst , that the town is being stalked by a vicious murderer , the rest of the rather apathetic police force choose to view the incidents as merely coincidences , taking both a blind eye and a lackadaisical approach to police detective work . shaun of the dead managed to work , not so much by parodying the works of such horror auteurs as george a. romero , but rather paying high tribute to the man , and his creations . the patented pegg & wright style of humour was there simply as an added bonus to hoards of zombies who roamed the rather mundane looking streets of suburban london . hot fuzz takes that cue , and pots in the very same way . but my affections for this film greatly outweighed their previous project for three simple reasons . firstly , having a , , gun-blazing shootout in the middle of a somerfield supermarket is funny just passively thinking about it . secondly , simon pegg the hell out of a oap is about the funniest thing you are likely to see all year . but the main reason is much more broad : hot fuzz is in love with the chuck norris ' of this world . the fact that it shows this much passion and unapologetic enthusiasm for the , beefcakes of latter 20th century hollywood , is what provides this film with the icing on the cake . at the same time -- pegg and wright do not let the laughs let up for one second . this is very much a case of if you missed that last gag , do n't worry there will another one along shortly . timothy dalton plays the villainous antagonist with so much evil suavity you kind of wait for him to start cackling and stroking his beard , but seeing him in this just made me realised how long it had been before he did anything actually worth noticing . and there are various cameos from a selection of britain 's finest comedy acts , ranging from bill bailey and steve coogan , to serious thesps like edward woodward , jim broadbent and paddy considine . the final 25 minutes of hot fuzz is kind of what midsummer murders might look like if john woo had directed an episode of it . and the grand old daddy of action cinema would be proud . this is top quality british comedy , and in my opinion , even surpasses the laughter ratio on shaun of the dead .		7		1
arguably better than the norman jewison film it is derived from , definitely director john mctiernan 's last watchable film , `` the thomas crowne affair '' stars pierce brosnan and rene russo as a couple of thrill-seekers on either side of the law . he steals paintings , she chases crooks . pretty soon they 're naked and in each other 's arms . the film is all style , bouncing from sex , to seduction , to smoothly choreographed heist scenes . when we 're not watching pierce and rene shamelessly flirting , we 're getting high off watching pierce 's character get high off the wealth and power he exudes . he 's suave , debonair and perpetually nonchalant . mctiernan adopts an equally slick , relaxed tone , complemented well by a jazzy score by the legendary bill conti . standout scenes include pierce taking rene on a date in a duo discus glider . i bet steve mcqueen , who starred in jewison 's 1968 film , is jealous . this genre 's grand-daddy is alfred hitchcock 's `` to catch a thief '' , another film which invites its audience to salivate over wealth , power and cutesy transgressions . mctiernan would be arrested for wire-tapping in early 2006 . 8/10 -- worth one viewing .		7		1
club dread is a movie that clearly pretends to spoof the slasher movies , in spite of being one of them . i mean , it is a slasher movie -- because in fact it has plenty of blood scenes -lrb- much more than many other movies that are `` serious slashers '' -rrb- -- but it is done in a sarcastic way , and it 's full of subtle and intelligent humour ! it has n't the hilarious sort of humour , that makes you laugh from the beginning until the end , but it is the kind of movie that makes you smile and think : `` yeah , there are really people like that ! '' so , it 's not a traditional spoof movie , kind of scary movie or something , but , on the other hand , a movie that 's inserted in its own genre but jokes with itself ! i guess it has an extra value for that ! the plot is very simple and fits perfectly in the typical slasher type : in a paradisiacal island resort , in costa rica , there 's a killer that is slashing some staff members . some people are dying and the killer can be anyone of the members . everyone is suspected . classic ! but the fun of it all is that 's all done in an ironic way ! about the setting , the island is really fantastic : great resort , full of beautiful beaches and gorgeous women -lrb- there 're some nude and sex scenes too , like in any typical slasher -rrb- ! it would be the paradise if we just forget about the killer ! to sum up , the movie is not excellent but it is funny and entertaining enough .		7		1
lolita -lrb- 1962 -rrb- top 5 - 1962 stanley kubrick 's ` lolita ' is an unusual delight , a sort of sexual comedy/drama , that is both funny and tragic at times . kubrick 's later revisited the subject of sexual obsession in his final masterpiece ` eyes wide shut ' . this early film by one of the masters of cinema , has james mason playing humbert humbert , a european immigrant , who falls for his landlady 's 14 year old daughter , with that lovely , lyrical name ` lolita ' . humbert marries lolita 's mother , so he can keep alive , his perverse sexual obsession . the story evolves from there ... peter sellers , the legendary peter sellers plays a minor role as the playwright who the life of humbert , lolita and her mother . kubrick 's film is a roller-coaster of emotions , laughter and mixed feelings . this is a fine film , , but nowhere near to some of the director 's greatest works -lrb- 2001 , shining , eyes wide shut -rrb- . this film is almost like grand shakespearian tragedy , love betrayal , obsession , told by one of cinema 's most interesting personalities . 7/10		7		1
slightly disturbed and painfully shy angela baker -lrb- felissa rose -rrb- is sent away to summer camp with her cousin . not long after angela 's arrival , things start to go horribly wrong for anyone with sinister or less than honorable intentions . the way i hear it , this film is either loved or hated . i love it . the acting is cheesy , but i presume purposely so . the kills are grisly and nasty , even if not always shown on screen . and the pedophile cook ? oh man ... that 's pushing boundaries that even horror films dare not cross -lrb- freddy krueger can be a child killer , but not a child molester -rrb- . i ca n't vouch for the sequels , but the original stands as a true modern classic , and if you have n't seen it , you 're really missing out on an important piece of horror history .		7		1
although the much loved and touted `` freeway scene '' is almost as good , and certainly not better , than the `` freeway scene '' in terminator 2 -lrb- 1993 -rrb- ten years earlier , it is near suicide , but will put you on life support , for a sequel to have such a standard action vehicle turn as your centerpiece . the premise of the first film was so original and fresh that one wonders how it could run out of creative juice by the middle of the second movie . was that it ? the introduction of a mostly talked about zion was the best new thing they could do . there is a lot of nifty action , but , then again , in such an ambitious and mega-budgeted sequel , the innovation of multiple smiths is not used once , but twice . the low battery light is flashing in this one and as everyone will find out , there will be no `` phone exit '' to get you recharged in the final film of the trilogy . so they mercifully pull the plug .		7		1
this movie was such a sweet heartwarming tale . it had its funny moments its action it really is a perfect movie for the kids . and for the adults the acting was great and it had a very good story very predictable but not when i was a kid . this movie is about a young lion cub `` simba '' who is tricked into thinking he was responsible for his fathers death so ridden with guilt he leaves the pride and goes off on his own . he grows up on his own but meets lifelong friends on the way . this was such an adorable tale . everyone is sure to love this movie exspecially the kids but the adults will find it very sweet and heartwarming as well .		7		1
akiro kurosawa 's most famous film , rashomon , tells the story of a murder from four different perspectives . the first is a bandit who claims he fooled a samurai to follow him on a trail to see some valuable swords there . he tied the guy to a tree and brings a woman to the area and seduces her . she is filled with shame asks the bandit to free her husband for a duel . he unties him and they battle to the death . the samurai 's wife says that she was raped by the bandit and she begged her husband to forgive her , but he refused and she untied him , fainted and woke up with the knife in her hand and her spouse dead on the ground . the samurai 's tale is told through a medium . he says that after his wife was raped , she was asked to travel with the bandit and she agreed and asked her attacker to kill her husband as she did not want to be with two men . the samurai killed himself and a passerby removed the knife . the final version is told by a woodcutter who says that he witnessed the assault . the bandit asked the woman to marry him . the woman asks them to fight for her , and at first they are reluctant . after constant ridicule , they have a duel which results in the death of the samurai . the wife takes off . at a temple , a priest , the woodcutter , and another man hear a baby crying . the child has been abandoned and left in a basket . it concludes with a discussion about the nature of man . much like citizen kane , rashomon is considered a classic of cinema . i found it interesting , but somewhat cold . i 'll watch it again , and maybe it will have a greater impact next time .		7		1
in the first 10 minutes of `` tron : legacy , '' the audience gets a quick briefing of what happened in the original film . by quick briefing , i mean we get the basic overview of what happened to kevin flynn -lrb- jeff bridges -rrb- and when he disappeared . the film then flashes to present time where we meet kevin 's son sam -lrb- garrett hedlund -rrb- who we learn is now 28 years old and still is n't over his father 's disappearance . after his yearly prank on his fathers company encom , sam gets visited by one of his fathers old friends alan -lrb- bruce boxleitner -rrb- who informs sam that he has received a message from his father coming from the flynn arcade . after some convincing on alan 's part , sam makes his way over to the arcade only to find a secret room hidden behind the tron arcade game that could be a portal to his father . a visually stunning film ensues ... for the 45 to 60 minutes of the film , i was extremely involved with `` tron : legacy . '' it was interesting , amazing to look at , and the story was good enough to hold one 's interest . then all of a sudden i found myself bored with the film . the story started feeling a little limp and i did n't really care all that much about the characters either . the film started going downhill when quorra -lrb- olivia wilde -rrb- came into the picture , not saying that she was a bad character because she probably was one of my favorites , but this is when the story started to drag . on top of the lack of details -lrb- poor character development and character background -rrb- , the emotional attachment between sam and kevin seemed to be missing . at first , i did n't know whether to blame bridges and hedlund for that or adam horowitz and edward kitsis for not having a stronger screenplay . but after a few moments of debate , i would honestly have to blame the screenwriters because they are the ones who did n't dig deeper into these characters . the script did n't give them a whole lot of background so they were only working with what they had and they did try their best . the story also was n't that interesting after a while , it 's like ok he 's here to save his dad , i get it but what else ? do n't even get me started on the lack of back story on the actual tron character . they just left that wide open with very little explanation . as for the high points of `` tron : legacy '' well that goes right to the visual effects . the movie looks absolutely stunning . the set designs are amazing , the uniforms are awesome , and the whole entire grid looks brilliant . the design of the grid itself was also believable . you truly believe that this is what the inside of a computer looks like . i give everyone who was involved with the visual elements of the film major kudos points and that includes director joseph kosinski , who really captured the visual aspect of the film . besides the visual aspect of the film , the music is the film is also amazing . the score was by daft punk who has been getting nothing but phrase for their music . i have to agree with everyone else because the music really made the film . i think it was one of the strongest elements of both the trailer and the film itself . besides , the music and visuals , there is a really amazing scene where sam enters into a club , which is extremely well shot and visually appealing . the race scenes are pretty sweet and the background recap in the beginning is also well done . the acting is decent , nothing great but not bad . it 's typical film acting all around . when bridges plays kevin flynn he mixes his character from the original tron in with the dude from `` the big lebowski . '' when bridges plays clu , who is the bad guy in the film , he actually does this extremely well . i think bridges had much more to work with playing clu than with kevin to be fair . he did a good job with both though overall . olivia wilde is good in the film , not to mention easy on the eyes . her character was simple and she played it off well . garrett hedlund , who played sam , was decent in the film . he was probably the weakest of all the acting but than again he is n't as established of an actor as the rest of them . also even though he was n't in the film much , i have to give props to michael sheen , who was just wacky and crazy in the film . his character was by far the most interesting because he was so odd . in the end , `` tron : legacy '' was a a unique movie experience . it was visually appealing with some decent scenes and a killer soundtrack . the problem , however , was what i call the `` avatar '' effect . it was amazing to look at but when it came down to the end , it could have been a lot better with a more solid story . like `` avatar '' the film lacked a complex story as well as great character development . it just was n't as interesting as it should have been . it did n't hold my interest after i got past how cool it looked . i still would recommend the film , however , i just would n't give it as high of marks as i would have liked and that in itself is a shame because the film definitely had the potential to be something great ! moviemanmenzel 's final rating for `` tron : legacy '' is a 7 out of 10 .		7		1
the battle of thermopylae is probably one of the most famous battles in ancient history , as it is often used as a prime example that the size of an army does not decide a battle . the reason for this lays in the fact that in thermopylae , a small army of roughly 7000 greek soldiers managed to defend themselves against the biggest army of its time , the persians , which counted in its ranks more than soldiers . while this is the main reason behind its importance , the battle has reached mythical status because it was also an example of courage , as when the battle seemed lost , most of the greek soldiers retreated with the exception of 300 spartans , who decided to put a tremendous last stand against their enemy . their courage not only inspired 700 thespians to join them , but also has inspired many notable works of art , most recently the 1962 movie `` the 300 spartans '' and frank miller 's 1998 comic book `` 300 '' . now , miller 's graphic novel is the basis of a new movie about thermopylae : zack snyder 's `` 300 '' . `` 300 '' can be summarized as the tale of the battle of thermopylae , as narrated by a spartan soldier named dilios -lrb- david wenham -rrb- to his fellow spartans . the story begins with a brief recounting of king leonidas ' -lrb- gerard butler -rrb- youth , and the events that made him the courageous leader he was . years later , as a spartan king , he receives the news that king xerxes of persia -lrb- rodrigo santoro -rrb- is on his way to europe , and gives the chance to sparta to join him in his quest for conquering the world . prefering to keep his people free instead of paying tribute to xerxes , leonidas refuses , and prepares himself to defend his people . however , the spartan council has been bought by xerxes , and refuses to allow leonidas to go to battle with the full spartan army . knowing that this will be his people 's doom , leonidas decides to take with him only 300 of his best soldiers and goes to battle the enormous asian army alone . adapted by kurt johnstad , michael gordon and snyder himself , the movie is almost a word for word translation of frank miller 's graphic novel , which as well was mainly based on herodotus ' writings on the subject . however , this does n't mean that miller 's work -lrb- and the movie -rrb- is an accurate history lesson , as miller 's art takes enormous artistic liberties with the story , making the battle of thermopylae more mythic than realistic . while this of course may bother purists , it truly works in the context of the story -lrb- being after all the narration of a soldier -rrb- , as an exaltation of the achievements of a country 's army that of course demonizes its enemies . more an action film than a drama about war , the movie delivers good entertainment as the simple plot unfolds nicely despite some severe lack of character development . the film 's highlight is definitely the visual look that director zack snyder uses for his movie . using the same digital technique than robert rodriguez used for `` sin city '' -lrb- another of frank miller 's comic books -rrb- , snyder brings miller 's graphic art to life with an extremely faithful care for details , almost putting every frame of the comic book to screen . this highly stylized visual look not only extends to digital backgrounds and special effects , snyder 's movie uses slow motion , great choreographs and a superb art direction to create an operatic narration that , just like in miller 's comic book , accentuates the mythic traits of the story , showing spartans as super-soldiers and the persian army as a hellish array of monsters . while completely inaccurate historically , it fits the story snyder is trying to tell , although this extreme care for the style often makes him forget to care for the substance . now , `` 300 '' is without a doubt a great technical achievement and visually , a wonderful film to watch , but it has some major problems deep inside , with the performances by the cast being the top of the iceberg . while gerard butler has received a lot of criticism as king leonidas , he is truly one of the best in the film , and does a really good job with what he has to work . the best in the film is david wenham , who truly adds a lot of mood and atmosphere to the movie with his narration . sadly , not everyone in the cast was up to the challenge , and one wonders if they were chosen for the part thanks to their physical looks instead of acting talent . lena headey , michael fassbender and tom wisdom are really the main offenders , who make some of the worse parts of the script look even worst with their poor delivery . personally , i think that the movie 's most serious problem is the lack of characterization in the story , as miller 's simplification of the battle made most of the characters look two dimensional at best . while it is true that miller remained true to herodotus and that some lines came straight from his work , it 's hard to stop noticing how silly some dialogs are . true , it 's an action film , but a little more of care while developing the script would had been enormously beneficial . another problem of the film is definitely snyder 's complete focus on the visual aspect of his movie . do n't get me wrong , i know that a movie like `` 300 '' is n't supposed to be a powerful drama , however , snyder 's visuals tend to get pretty overwhelming , with an excessive use of slow motion that while effective at first , soon becomes a tiring gimmick . while i do consider `` 300 '' to be a flawed film , i must say that it 's pointless to judge it in terms of historical accuracy because it never attempts to be accurate and dwells more in the realms of myth . many have criticized this aspect -lrb- as well as miller 's obvious political subtexts -rrb- without noticing that `` 300 '' is not here to illustrate , but to provide good entertainment , and despite all its problems , it achieves that purpose against all odds . 7/10		7		1
this was part of a series of boy movies that all seemed to come out at the same time . it is very amusing although at times a bit much . vince vaughn and jon favreau are fantastic . pretty run of the mill story but the characters make it very funny and worth watching . great dialogue .		7		1
back in the 70 's john belushi and dan akroyd introduced the characters of jake and elwood blues on the ever popular saturday night live . in 1980 legendary director john landis gave the characters their own feature length film . the blues brothers stars belushi and akroyd as jake and elwood , respectively , and it follows them as they attempt to put their old band back together in order to raise money to save the catholic orphanage home where they were raised . dubbing this quest a mission from god the two set out on a wacky and action packed adventure full of screwball situations and nut job characters . what ensues is a lot of fun . the blues brothers is one of those essential 80 's comedies . it 's worked its way to earning the status of a classic and so these days , no matter how you feel about comedies , it 's just one of those that you have to see . it 's also one of the very few successful films to be made out of snl characters , and that 's always a treat to watch , especially if you know the characters from the tv show . seeing them come to life in a whole new way through the big screen is something really exciting to witness . and with characters as classic as jake and elwood blues , played by their original actors , the ingenious dan akroyd and john belushi , it had to have been a nostalgic experience for 1980 audiences . i did n't get as much of this , however . i know the characters for how iconic they are today and i 've seen some of the blues brothers snl skits , but i ca n't say this movie had the same effect for me as it would have had for audiences back in the day excited to see their favorite snl characters put on the big screen . as far as this just being a good movie , it 's funny and that 's about it . i definitely enjoyed watching this flick , but it 's not much more than just a silly over-the-top comedy . the only thing that makes it better than a lot of the other screwball comedies like it would be it 's great actors and the legendary status behind the characters . all in all , the blues brothers is just a lot of hilarious wackiness with some crazy song and dance numbers thrown in throughout . it 's a lot of fun in a weird , explosive , irreverent way .		7		1

anthony minghella , responsible for such films as the english patient -lrb- which i did not like despite the acclaim -rrb- and the talented mr. ripley -lrb- which i liked -rrb- , returns with another adaptation - cold mountain , which entails the war scenario passed down by the gone with the wind movie gods . jude law and nicole kidman play two people , inman and ada , who 've barely known each other before law goes off to fight in the war , but they write -lrb- kidman contributes voice-overs that more often than not do n't work or are n't needed for the story -rrb- to one another , that is until he witnesses a terrible battle years later . he becomes a deserter , as he travels across wild parts of the south on her way back to her . during this time ada 's father dies , and she 's all alone until a girl from the mountains who 's also lost her father , ruby -lrb- renee zellweger -rrb- , comes down to help on the farm . it does n't take this reviewer to tell where the story is headed , and that 's probably how minghella liked it set up -lrb- from charles frazier 's book -rrb- . there 's much that i liked about cold mountain : the strong , production design by dante ferretti , an entertaining battle sequence near the beginning , and an all-star cast that , though mostly supporting , does it 's job well . and among the oscar nominations the film is bound to receive -lrb- from my perspective this film follows in the tradition that miramax puts out at least one film every year around this time to garner some space in the audience at the show -rrb- , i 'd say that zellweger could perhaps get her 's . what i did n't think was all that great about the movie , and what makes it over-rated , is that it 's a story that makes itself too clear that this will happen now , and this will happen in the next scene , and in a few minutes we can expect this , and so on . the presence of confederate soldiers , always on the look out for traitors around ada 's region , makes it all too by-the-books , so to speak . a couple of minutes could 've been chopped off as well . is it a well made movie ? yes , but maybe it 's too well made for its own good .		7		1
i ought to begin this one with a disclaimer . you see , the title is misleading . yes , there is a tarantula in this . with that said , for a short , 77 minute film , it 's not in it much . if that is what you 're mainly looking for , this may not be your best bet . however , if that fact does not bother you , this is good stuff . for one thing , arnold -lrb- who i 'm growing increasingly interested in the work of , with this and especially the incredible shrinking man -rrb- does a great job at making the `` monster '' sympathetic . there is next to no xenophobia or sexism in this ... not only that , the latter quality is openly mocked in this ! very impressive . like aforementioned other movie by this director , it is also actually * about * something -lrb- instead of merely footage of people running away from creatures that are considerably larger than they are -rrb- ; in this case , the subject is overpopulation and what we will do for food , an issue that enormously important today ; yes , it 's only grown more relevant . the writing is n't bad . we get funny , clever and natural dialog . the characters are credible , well-developed and the two leads have chemistry . fx are nice enough , if they are basic by today 's standards . the make-up is rather well-done . we get beautiful shots of nature , and the editing and cinematography are solid . a bit of tension is built skillfully , and this does n't show anything it should n't . it has a fairly effective opening . there is some mildly graphic violence in this . the dvd comes with a german dub . i recommend this to fans of 50 's sci-fi horror flicks . 7/10		7		1
`` for a good return , you got ta go bettin ' on chance , '' a character says in the coen bros ' `` miller 's crossing '' , `` and then you 're back with anarchy , right back in the jungle . '' his line encapsulates the point of virtually every coen flick : nothing matters , chaos reigns , so just fck it and laugh at some idiots . few filmmakers encapsulate the tenets of postmodernism as purely as the coens . vehemently deny any such thing as absolute truth , revel in nihilism , sarcasm and irony , reject all social and hold words and images to be viciously , all systems of signs only referring to other signs , all language a web of references . as postmodernism is associated with relativism -lrb- anything goes , the era of `` whatever '' -rrb- , such artists believe that no meaning can be derived from text other than whatever subjective meaning the interpreter assigns to it . since there are no absolutes , the very linguistic symbols used by the author to communicate are undermined . with symbols undermined , surface becomes the artist 's primary tool . enter the age of `` that 's so random '' , of incessant pastiche and sampling -lrb- or as andrew moss calls the coens , `` agents of schizophrenia '' -rrb- . gradually postmodernist art evolves to the point at which it starts to mirrors the universe it believes in : total randomness and utter nihilism . the universe of noir . every coen flick is a hybrid of noir and screwball comedy . noir , with its conspiratorial , universe , being the one genre that aligns itself perfectly to the coens ' world-view -lrb- noir is screwball minus comedy -rrb- . hence a filmography which is exclusively about the world being `` about '' nothing other than random , cosmic causality . this is the problem with being too intelligent for your own good . everything either becomes a tongue-in-cheek homage , or you wallow in the dead end of intellectual limits , finding new and clever ways to over the vacuity of existence . woody allen has made a career out of doing just this , both the coens and allen oscillating between `` '' and `` funny '' formalist games about nothingness . early coen films -lrb- `` barton '' , `` o brother '' -rrb- even went so far as to deride socially conscious artists altogether . `` fck it , dude , '' is the coen motto , as a title card in the coens ' `` a serious man '' essentially reads . of course everything is a bit `` meaningless '' -- but one should question the productivity of not taking the next step and asking , `` so what now ? '' if the pointlessness of life exists only to be talked about and converted into art , then that talking and that art are just as pointless as life . better , perhaps , to break through the wall , creating some meaning or finding some that has evaded you thus far . which is why the mantra of cinema 's late modernists was always `` nothing matters , so everything does '' . aesthetically , all coen flicks are genre mash-ups , thematically , a form of designer nihilism . with `` man '' they take bergman 's existential movies and replace christian iconography with jewish iconography . the film begins in early 20th century poland , where a jewish couple battle over the identity of an elderly man . is he a dead spirit , or is he simply flesh ? this metaphysical enquiry runs across the entire film , in which a middle class jew called larry gopnik finds himself caught in a noir plot in which all manners of cosmic and comic misfortunes befall him . seeking a spiritual answer for his woes -lrb- is all chaos and chance ? does god exist ? -rrb- , and unable to face the temptations and immoralities he falsely believes a godless life to entail , larry turns to various religious figures . he is a serious man , you see , a physics teacher with a savant brother likewise obsessed with finding signs . through serious investigation he will surely get to the root of his troubles . a reason will be found ! and so larry climbs his roof and surveys suburbia , searching for answers . `` look for god in the parking lot , '' one rabbi advises . later , prophetically , a car crash the chaos of larry 's life . but is this proof of a guiding hand ? an unseen order ? `` who cares , '' a wise rabbi who brushes aside the reading of all signs tells our hero , before recommending : `` helping others ? could n't hurt . '' `` man '' ends with larry 's life derailing further -lrb- a tornado , the threat of illness -rrb- , whilst simultaneously reassembling itself -lrb- job promotion , reconciliation with wife -rrb- . in other words , the good and the bad are both entirely unpredictable and inextricable , a fact which serious larry should have long realised , as he spends the first half of the film -lrb- as characters in the coens ' `` the man who was n't there '' do -rrb- literally lecturing his classroom on both the uncertainty principle and schrodinger 's cat . while larry frets , his son , like the dude lebowski , simply abides . interested only in music and tv , the kid coasts through life whilst listening to abraxas , an album by santana . with this album comes the film 's philosophy . throughout the film larry rejects the abraxas album - abraxas being a gnostic term for god - refuses to listen to it , whilst his son `` gets god '' by doing nothing . end result : bobby mcferrin 's `` do n't worry be happy '' meets `` forrest gump '' -lrb- all coen flicks are rifts on `` forrest gump '' , where action is denigrated and inaction and idiocy are rewarded -rrb- meets `` et 's '' `` be good '' . the year `` serious '' was released , woody allen was serving up the same message with `` whatever works '' : stop being serious , do n't think , do whatever , find someone you love and fck everything else . of course the coens are atheists , so they 're not advocating the son 's chilled out path to spirituality . perpetually with a direct line to the heavens -lrb- shots of tunnels , funnels and headphones -rrb- and always listening to jefferson airplane -lrb- `` when the truth 's found to be lies , find somebody to love '' -rrb- , the kid is a stand in for the coens and their one love . cinema is their divinity , self-absorption is their art , each film retreating further away from a world they 've long deemed both pointless and hostile . 7.9 / 10 -- worth two viewings .		7		1
a man named arkin needs quick cash . lucky for him , he recently began work at a home with a safe that he can break into . not so lucky for him , on the night he decides to do this , a serial killer known as the collector has decided to target the same house . arkin is now both predator and prey . i feel this film was simply under-appreciated and misunderstood . lots of fans have complained of the lack of plot and senseless violence . one reviewer even says , `` kevin set up better traps in home alone '' -lrb- which may be true -rrb- . but the lack of plot is more because of the confusing nature of the story than any real lack of substance . i spoke with patrick melton , the writer , and while i already enjoyed the film -lrb- in many ways it beats the `` saw '' series melton also developed -rrb- his explanation of the collector 's motives made it more enjoyable . some viewers do not understand why the traps exist ... well , you have to understand that the collector plays with his victims -- his goal is not to kill them , necessarily . others have been more favorable , referring to the film 's cinematography and `` 80s aesthetic '' . i agree . you can tell many instances where marcus dunstan was meticulous with his shots . pay attention to how many quick half-second shots were probably added in later , filmed a dozen times to be perfect . a casual viewer will not see this , but the critic will appreciate the art . if you missed `` the collector '' in theaters , get the dvd or blu-ray . i have a suspicion that when `` collector 2 '' appears , there will be a new-found appreciation for this original conception -- thrills , blood , gore , mystery ... much deeper than it first appears .		7		1
regarded as kurosawa 's masterpiece , this is a visually opulent film about a rape and a murder told from multiple viewpoints . while kurosawa displays his cinematic genius with the camera , the acting is more suited to the theater , with exaggerated gestures and emotional displays . mifune is a compelling presence , but he , like most of the cast , overacts wildly at times . the story is interesting but becomes too melodramatic and the plot element concerning the baby seems to be tacked on as an afterthought . the score seems to be based on ravel 's `` bolero . '' a very open-ended film , leaving much to interpretation , which is fine , but it could have benefited from some subtlety .		7		1
war-time film noir has small-time promoter frankie -lrb- mature -rrb- accused of murdering a young client -lrb- landis -rrb- just as she is leaving him for hollywood . a brutish police inspector -lrb- cregar -rrb- is convinced frankie did the dastardly deed , and hounds him . the dead woman 's sister -lrb- grable -rrb- , at first skeptical of frankie , comes to believe him and helps him as the police tighten their net . it will be evident who the real murderer is from the moment he appears on screen , but the fun here is in following the tense cat and mouse game between frankie and the obsessive inspector . cregar steals every scene he is in . and pinup queen grable ai n't half-bad as the conflicted sister . colorful supporting cast includes alan mowbray as a washed-up actor , william gargan as a society columnist , charles lane as a florist , morris ankrum as an assistant da and elisha cook jr. as a front desk man . well worth a look .		7		1
this title from frank miller 's sin city is a good pick because this movie is also a film noir . as its director wanted it , it 's about characters that are `` lost , lonely and lethal '' -lrb- another sin city 's title -rrb- . it 's funny to see what happens to al because i 'm also a city loner , a bird of the night and a worker that have been seduced in his work . all this tension makes us sometimes a bit overreact but it gives us our originality as well . the only difference between al and me is that i do n't go to bars . maybe i should . i always heard about it as the comeback of al after the disaster of `` revolution '' thus it has been 5 years without him at his prime age . imagine all the good movies that could have happened ! except shania twain , i do n't know any other artist that run away so long from the stage . in all cases , he brought a lot of new fresh faces here : goodman , jackson , rooker ! if watching `` frankie and johnny '' made me watching a romance changing into a drama , this one is about a cop movie changing into a romance .		7		1
once cusack has that key in his hand , the audience is in for the duration . though `` 1408 '' is a much more a scary movie -- than a horror film -- it maintains a certain geniality with regard to its audience . director mikael hafstrom -lrb- `` derailed '' -rrb- never resorts to the cheap device of trying to shock us with disgusting visuals -- or scare us by threatening to disgust us . from start to finish , it remains a pleasure to watch our hero get tortured , and the movie 's frights are well-earned : `` 1408 '' gets underneath the viewer 's skin in a psychological way . there are n't many stephen king stories that have translated to quality films . so when one comes along it 's worth acknowledging . john cusack delivers as a skeptical writer investigating paranormal events . while investigating theses events , he insists on staying in the reportedly haunted room 1408 at the dolphin hotel against all warnings from hotel manager -lrb- samuel l. jackson -rrb- . he discovers the room 's deadly secret -- an evil so powerful , no one has ever survived an hour within it 's puts in motion an irresistibly watchable situation -- and then delivers by giving us more than just the clever setup . this is john cusack 's vehicle and he delivers a fine performance . cusack 's character is instantly fascinating : the cynical , hard-drinking writer who we just know is about to have a terrifying experience . there 's humor in his slightly surreal exchange with the hotel manager , gerald olin -lrb- samuel l jackson -rrb- , as olin tries to warn -- and then bribe mike not to stay in the famously `` evil '' room . suspense mixes with more sharp humor as mike checks in and very gradually starts to notice some weird goings-on , that escalate into full-blown horror . the film engages and holds our attention through its complexity . the room is a room of tangible horror . but it 's also a chamber of hallucination -- a space outside time -- a place where the unconscious is eventual ending is certainly thought - provoking , its ambiguity -- both laudable and frustrating . it 's still a slight story , but cusack 's charisma keeps the build-up watchable , and the denouement just the right side of far-fetched . jackson 's character is disappointingly underused , but fans of cusack -- stephen king , and psychological horror will want to check out `` 1408 '' as much as mike does .		7		1
let 's make one thing perfectly clear . i am not an adam sandler fan . if it is within my power to avoid seeing adam sandler on the big screen , small screen , or on the cover of people magazine , then i do so at all costs . the problem is that i have this girlfriend . she loves to watch adam sandler movies . then again , my girlfriend will watch just about any film slapped onto a dvd and put into a case . she truly believes that if it says on the cover ` hilarious and uproarious ' it must be so because they would n't print false advertisement since the manufacturer could be sued . okay , so i 'm exaggerating a bit but only a little bit . anyway , the first adam sandler film i saw was the waterboy , a film many found to be ` hilarious and uproarious ' i found it to be ` stupid and idiotic cinematic crapola . ' from that point in time , i vowed to cleanse my soul by making it my life 's mission to never occupy the same room if there was even a whiff of adam sandler strutting across the tv screen . until last night , except for one bout with mr. deeds , i had pretty much succeeded in that regard , but then my world caved in again . having been to the theater three times this week without her -lrb- she was working so do n't blast me -rrb- , the aforementioned girlfriend insisted i sit and watch a film of her choosing . her choosing was 50 first dates , a film she had borrowed from a co-worker . catastrophe ! and worst yet , co-starring rob schneider ! yech ! well maybe i could fall asleep and she would n't notice . then again , drew barrymore was also in it and i loved her in e.t. and loved her in firestarter when she was doing that really cool fire trick with her brain so maybe i would n't suffer too much . true to form , the early part of 50 first dates is typical adam schneider shtick . henry roth -lrb- adam sandler -rrb- is a hawaii veterinarian who talks to his animals like dr. doolittle , and is heavy into one night stands with female tourists . to avoid having them become attached and want to stay in hawaii with him he tells them stuff like he 's a secret agent getting ready to go on a mission . so supposedly every female tourist that vacations in hawaii is a dumb bimbo which they would have to be to fall for such nonsense . it was n't funny and i was suffering already . henry 's best friend and hanger on , ula -lrb- rob schneider -rrb- comes to see henry whenever he needs stitched up after having had a shark take a bite out of him . he also comes to see henry hoping that henry will relate every detail of his one night stands to him , because ula 's wife just does n't do it for him anymore . ula also brings along his brood of kids . as it turns out , the kids are cute , ula is surprisingly funny , so are the kids , and my pain eases a bit . then there 's henry 's assistant alexa -lrb- lusia strus -rrb- . she looks like cloris leachman had just made a wrong turn from the set of young frankenstein and ended up in the wrong movie . her jokes are bad , we 've seen the ugly assistant bit before and done much better , and then a walrus pukes on her and i 'm back wallowing in my misery once again . soon henry is having breakfast in a diner that specializes in spam and eggs so that later on we can have a few spam jokes thrown our way . it is then that he spots lucy whitmore -lrb- drew barrymore -rrb- making a house out of her waffles . he puts the moves on her , they have a nice conversation , henry is attracted to her as a person and not as a bimbo , there 's a funny guy sitting at the counter , the people that run the restaurant are kind of funny , and it looks like things are back on track . it 's only a temporary reprieve though because when henry goes back to the diner to meet her the next morning he finds out that she wakes up every day not remembering what happened the day before . this time when he tries to make hay with her , he fails and once again the film goes astray as we get scene after scene after scene of henry meeting lucy in the diner or down the road trying to get her to notice him so that they can have another first date . the sequences are totally done for slapstick , not remotely funny , and although we can sympathize with henry 's motives the low brow comedy just does n't fit in with what he is trying to achieve or what the story is really about . eventually henry meets lucy 's father marlin -lrb- blake clark -rrb- and her brother doug -lrb- sean astin -rrb- . there is a funny yet touching sequence where we see lucy coming home and marlin and doug have to relive the same day over and over again because if lucy finds out she loses her memory everyday , she becomes traumatized . as you can tell the film is all over the place . there are times when it 's a very well done sweet romantic comedy , with a lot of heart . at other times , it seems to want to sink back into the usual ineptness of low-brow films like the waterboy . eventually , in the latter part of fifty first dates , the comedy do subside for the most part and the film seems to get on track . a lot of this can be attributed to drew barrymore who gives a very sensitive portrayal of a woman trapped by circumstances beyond her control . whenever she is on the screen , the film lifts itself up about ten notches . despite my earlier comments , i have always felt barrymore was often underrated in the acting department . her problem is she picks some lousy scripts with which to display that talent . sandler however eventually tones down his shtick quite a bit , leaving the lowbrow comedy up to schneider which is where it should have stayed in the first place because most of his lines are the funniest in the film . likewise , astin and the rest of the supporting cast are good also , but there 's a running joke about body building concerning doug that continues on way too long and was n't really necessary at all . this is the kind of film i find infuriating . there 's a wonderfully romantic story , so why did writer george wing not take that and run with it ? why sink to the idiotic antics that are so unnecessary especially when we 've seen that kind of thing from sandler so many times ? when halfway through the film sandler begins to show how much he does care for lucy and the steps he takes to help her overcome her desperate plight , it 's a side of sandler we seldom see . he still ca n't act , as evidenced by his stupidly awful crying scene -lrb- at one point he does a fake crying bit , later he cries for real and both are the same -rrb- , but lucy and henry 's romance was good enough that we could easily have overlooked his failings . there was much about 50 first dates that i enjoyed . there was a large amount of it that i did n't . in the end , i 'd have to say that the last half of the film is so good that it 's just enough for me to give it a recommendation . those who love the usual sandler films will enjoy the first half , and those like me who do n't will fall for the second half of the film . and most of all it has a very nicely well done ending , that kind of touched me and when a film does that i have no choice but to give it my grade . i should probably just give it a c and leave it at that , but since it 's an adam sandler film i have to grade on the curve and give it a b - but only because the romantic story was so well done , and i 'm just a romantic kind of guy . ca n't you tell ?		7		1
the film is correctly based on true events and interviews with witness . the picture is excellently played by a magnificent though unknown plethora of german actors as julia jentsch -lrb- the downfall -rrb- , fabian hinrichs and alexander held -lrb- the list -rrb- . it 's one of the films that nowadays deal to describe the nazi time from a german point of sight , such as : and the downfall . the motion picture was nominated for academy award to the best film in language no obtained prize in berlin to the best actress -lrb- jentsch -rrb- and the best director -lrb- marc rothemund -rrb- and european academy prize to the best actress and the best director . the real deeds are the following : the brothers sophie -lrb- julia jentsch -rrb- and hans scholl -lrb- fabian hinrichs -rrb- were a martyrs of the anti-nazi became students at the university of munich , where the movement for a revolt against hitler was especially was a medical student and sophie majored in by dr kurt huber , a teacher of philosophy , they were instrumental in organizing a resistance group known as the ¨ white rose ¨ , a organization of students oppose to hitler and the nazi propose ¨ to knock down the iron wall of fear and terror ¨ and ¨ to strive for the renewal of the mortally wounded german spirit ¨ . they kept in close touch with similar groups of students at other small duplicating machines , the students -lrb- among others florian stetter played by christoph probst -rrb- defied an enormously powerful state password white rose was designed to symbolize a christian spirit which love everything that was beautiful and noble and opposed the dictatorship of evil in national socialist , the brothers , helped by others students , took part in a demonstration on the streets of munich , the first protest of its also dropped leaflets from balcony of the university 's inner professor kurt huber drafted a leaflet that was scattered and said : ¨ in the name of german youth we demand of hitler that he return to us the personal freedom which is the most valuable possession of each german , and of which he has cheated us in the lowest possible manner ¨ . the scholls were reported to the gestapo about the by a building were arrested , along with four others , and brought before the people 's a hasty trial the scholls were sentenced to death . sophie appeared in court with a broken leg , resulting from her interrogation by gestapo agents -lrb- an inquisitive inspector well interpreted by alexander held -rrb- . she hobbled to her death on the scaffold , his brother hans was executed the same day.the brothers along with the professor kurt huber were beheaded .		7		1
for her first feature length directorial picture , helen hunt adapts from elinor lipman 's best selling novel of the same name . casting herself along side colin firth , bette midler and matthew broderick , hunt 's film follows the uneasy emotional path to fulfilment of april epner -lcb- hunt -rcb- . shortly after separating from her husband sam -lcb- broderick -rcb- , april 's world is further shaken by the death of her adoptive mother . yet solace is in the offering in the form of divorced single parent frank -lcb- firth -rcb- , but things start to get complicated by the sudden appearance of bernice -lcb- midler -rcb- . a bold showy talk show host who just happens to claim to be april 's birth mother ! all that and now sam is having second thoughts about letting their marriage go ... ... then she found me achieves that rare bittersweet thing of managing to blend its humour comfortably with its warm and intelligent core . also boosted by having its fine cast performing well with the material , it 's a film just waiting to be discovered by more people than it evidently has thus far . that 's not to say new viewers will instantly become fans of it , because for sure there are problems in the screenplay . but being tagged , as it has in some quarters , as the female bedfellow to sideways is possibly about right . which ultimately makes for an interesting viewing experience at the very least . hunt 's picture , as light as it is in the main , has a touch of sadness to it , certainly the characters are rather difficult to like , not because they are defined by who they are , but by what they do . it 's an oddity in the film that surprisingly helps the film along . apparently different from the source novel in terms of dialogue and the axis , the film has much to say about the foibles of a woman approaching middle age . a woman who suddenly finds herself at the crossroads of her life , to which it 's being influenced by other sources . the direction is steady and hunt manages to garner fine turns from her cast . there is nothing tricksy or technically brilliant within the piece . but it is a notable humanistic film that is content to let its earthiness see it home . not a comedy to split your sides with , and not a drama to shake you to your very core . it 's a sweet , intelligent picture that is worth the time of day if you be interested in this type of human story . 7/10		7		1
this movie has so much and if you can make the chemistry thing the sparking between bing and fred and ignore the sidebar romances that do n't quite grab you , then you will truly enjoy it . `` white christmas '' - the first performance of the standard and it always grabs me . and i must have seen it fifty plus times . the dancing scene with fred and the firecrackers , stupendous , incredible , how did he do it ?? forget the blackface bits , slightly offensive , even considering the era . and the for ww2 . evocative of 1942 and fdr . everything comes together beautifully down to the encore of `` white christmas '' and bing in the best of voice all through . story is just about zero and no credibility - imagine an inn open fifteen days of the year with an enormous cast for the floor show -lrb- with full orchestra , no less -rrb- . bankrupt after the payroll for one holiday would be my guess : > -rrb- . but lovely and nostalgic and worth watching over and over , just for the boys , fred and bing . 7 out of 10 .		7		1
every action movie needs a hero , and in the raid , it is rama -lrb- iko uwais -rrb- who at the beginning is seen doing pull ups , sit ups and punching a bag all in an early morning work out before waking his pregnant wife before leaving for work ; which will not be a nine to five job at a desk . he is next inside an armored truck with fellow heavily armed swat team members , on their way to a building controlled by a powerful mobster . once they gain entry , all hell breaks loose . as the team advances floor by floor , they encounter residents with automatic rifles , and are killed off like fish in a bowl , except for the leader and two other cops , including rama , who exhibits bruce lee style fighting skills , repeatedly in several well done battles . we know that it will lead up to a final confrontation with the best opponent at the end . the violence is over the top and the story fairly typical , with competent acting and good camera work . i do n't agree with the 8 + rating here , but i will give it a 7 .		7		1
a man , his girlfriend and their two wealthy friends get caught in a storm off the coast of spain . the man is forced to go to shore to seek help , but stumbles across a town with a legacy both dark and treacherous . as i 've said before , stuart gordon is the undisputed master of h. p. lovecraft adaptations , this one coming from the short story `` dagon '' and one other tale -lrb- to flesh it out -rrb- . he captures the imagery perfectly -- the storms , the fear of the water , the importance of an arcane faith -lrb- without making it cheesy -rrb- and of course the tentacles . the acting is quite good , especially from the star -lrb- who was also the star of `` dreams in the witch house '' -rrb- ... ezra godden , i believe his name is -lrb- forgive me if i 'm wrong -rrb- . he plays a much nerdier character than in `` dreams '' , so much so that i might not have even noticed it was the same actor . the other characters are also good . all of them . the bum , the girlfriend , the townsfolk ... i have no complaints . the scenery was very drab , and i mean that in a good way . it was a dirty , isolated town that really portrayed the feeling of helplessness . i read in another review that gordon moved the story from new england to spain to capture this feeling , as modern america really has no such place left . spain seemed natural , and fit the theme perfectly . besides , an ancient cult does tend to have more of a `` european '' rather than `` american '' flavor to it -lrb- unlike witches , which are right at home in america -rrb- . i really have to protest about the cgi in this film , though . some scenes use amateur computer graphics , which come across looking cartoonish . this upsets me any time i see it in a film , but even more so with stuart gordon . i have seen what he can do with old fashioned makeup and special effects . i 've been impressed . why has he resorted to this technique ? while i would say this is the least of the films i 've seen , it 's still a fine job . it 's probably the only film you 'll ever watch where you find a fish attractive . well , besides `` the little mermaid '' , of course . ariel 's pretty dang sexy .		7		1
based on the popular stage play , god of carnage , by yasmina reza , roman polanski directs and co-writes this film adaptation ` slash ' black comedy , featuring one of the best casting ensembles in a motion picture , from john c. reilly , jodie foster , christoph waltz , to kate winslet . even if `` carnage '' has major side effects , this is still one of the more better films of the previous year . when two pairs of parents have a cordial meeting , after their two sons were involved in a fight , their time progresses , causing them to be stuck in one room , when their childish behavior increases , causing the night to go haywire . john c. reilly and jodie foster play the parents of the boy struck by a stick , and this couple may seem friendly , but this will lead to some major differences . christoph waltz and kate winslet play the parents of the boy carrying the stick , and winslet has a major sickness problem , while waltz is too obsessed with using his cellphone . all of these parents are stuck together in one room , and this is our movie . but this one of the problems with this movie , the whole idea of staying in one space for the entire 76 minutes is kind of boring , and we are left with long conversations between the characters . it 's perfectly well-written , but there 's too much of it . also , when the movie tries to be funny , it proves that this is not the type of comedy that makes you laugh minute by minute , instead it just makes you laugh at the occurring situations . roman polanski 's directing is really used in such a unique perspective , and knows how to make a movie that 's brilliantly executed in a way that will test the patience of audiences . the performances are awesome , and they make the 76 minutes of being in one place awesome . john c. reilly is hilarious , jodie foster was superb , christoph waltz is awesome , and kate winslet was just perfect . also , when the ending happens , i was amazed at how polanski wraps up the movie right at a perfect time , and it puts an end to an enjoyable motion picture . yes , since this movie was based on a stage play , this movie sort of feels like a stage play , when there 's no plot and character development necessary . but everything from the well-written script , the masterful directing by roman polanski , and the terrific cast , `` carnage '' is a winner at a different level . out of all the well-made movies of 2011 , `` carnage '' is one of those movies that `` takes the cake '' . this is an entertaining , well-acted , and `` tour de force '' movie that i have ever seen . `` carnage '' , in my review , `` a refreshing well-made flick , but emotionally stuck '' .		7		1
okay , just so you know ... the scariest thing about skeleton key is that in the opening narration , if you close your eyes for just a moment , then open them real quick , you could swear that was goldie hawn on the screen , years ago in a movie that was never before released until now . that is how much kate resembles her mom in this movie . it is downright eerie . now for the part ... which is the rest of the movie . it 's kind of ironic that i saw this not long after reviewing burnt offerings , because both films do have a lot in common , though in many ways key most resembles a , more americanized version of the grudge . the biggest difference between all three pictures , is that key 's production values are a lot more evident , and having new orleans as a backdrop makes it about ten times spookier . not to mention that it has a sad , nostalgic feel about it , showing the city and its surroundings in all its dissipated glamour , pre-katrina . you 've probably heard this one before : career caretaker caroline -lrb- kate -rrb- is tired of working in places where basically the patients are just treated like corpses that are n't quite dead yet rather than people . fed up after the passing of her latest patient , she decides to go freelance and work for an elderly couple who live out in a rotting mansion in the swamps of parish , a location where you could just about do a hush , hush sweet charlotte remake without having to build a set , it 's that good and ghoulish . so caroline meets the suspicious and cantankerous violet devereaux , -lrb- gena rowlands -rrb- and her husband , ben -lrb- john hurt , in a good , nearly dialogue-free performance , very similar to grace zabriskie 's in the grudge -rrb- . lots of strange things are apparent from the first moment she arrives : the lack of mirrors in the house , strange noises and of course , the titular key given to her by violet , which opens each and every room in the house save one : `` the room in the attic . '' oh , hell , not that again ! but wait ... there 's more . if you 've seen enough of these kinds of movies , you will figure out the entire plot from a couple of clues that crop up right after caroline 's arrival , and i wo n't tell you which . but the first thing i thought when i saw them was : `` you 've got to be frickin ' kidding me ! '' also : there 's the casting . besides gena , who can still work a camera with the best of them , there 's peter sarsgaard as luke marshall , the devereaux family ` lawyer . ' if you know anything about casting , then you know by now that seeing peter pop up as a `` good guy '' is about as suspicious as having alan rickman pop up as a `` good guy '' in a movie that is not a british comedy . well , of course the house has a history , and everyone concerned has a part in that history repeating itself , involving old southern rules of segregation , race and class and an american offshoot of voodoo called ` hoodoo ' , not to mention the usual secrets and lies , twists and turns , and that 's all i want to say . this is n't a terrible little suspense thriller , but if you 've seen as many as i have , you 'll know not to expect too much . just think of this as a great compromise to make with a fellow viewer , family member or good friend , whose idea of extreme gore is walt disney 's old yeller , and who would probably die of a heart attack if you showed them anything stronger than the original psycho . so pop this into the dvd player instead for their sake , and save that copy of the hills have eyes remake for later . the skeleton key is not the worst movie you could end up watching , and hey , it 's a couple of hours spent with kate hudson ! some good deeds do get rewarded instead of punished .		7		1
a minimum of action and a strong sense of realism help raise this corporate melodrama above the pile . when the treadway corporation 's president dies in the streets of new york , a power scramble ensues which tests the integrity , morality , and manhood of everyone on the executive board -lrb- and yes , i think in this movie even stanwyck has a manhood !!! -rrb- . the really central issue , as bill holden makes clear in his rousing final speech , is pride -- what motivates a man to raise himself above the competition but also isolates him from his dreams and the ones he loves . paul douglas distinguishes himself as a sales executive who 's being blackmailed -lrb- along with corporate playboy calhern -rrb- by march into giving his vote over to him . is the company founder 's daughter , who has given up hope for living but finds it somewhere in holden 's speechifying . touches on issues close to the post-war american heart -- how profit motives have replaced pride in workmanship , how an individual can live with his decision to make sacrifices that destroy his dreams . worthy of notice .		7		1
a wealthy widow , mrs. laura henderson -lrb- judi dench -rrb- buys an old london theater and comes up with the brilliant idea to turn it in a performance hall with the non-stop shows featuring nude girls during world war ii . bob hoskins plays vivian van damm , her business partner , who is as stubborn and opinionated as she is but somehow they manage to stay friends and to maintain the respect and admiration for each other . i liked this little movie very much . it 's a well crafted dramedy with nice musical numbers , nudity , touching story , and it is based on the real events . dench and hoskins are marvelous together . 7.5 / 10		7		1
true story of a british attempt to trick the enemy into weakening sicily 's defenses before the 1943 attack , using a dead man with faked papers . i had heard of operation mincemeat , but did not really know much about it . how much is covered here is uncertain , and of course some elements are fictionalized -lrb- the father of the corpse , for example , is a completely invented figure -rrb- . but this is just a fascinating story , and even when told in a semi-fictional sense , it demands a level of curiosity . i feel like the film is not well-known , and that is not surprising : it is devoid of any known actors , and the director is also unknown to me . peter sellers provides a voice , but without being credited , so that hardly counts .		7		1
every now and then a movie about innocents being pursued by evil while on a mission for the good of all comes out and we all have to accept it as what it is : a kid movie . this one is about kids , aliens , alien kids , dogs , the rock and evil cardboard government agents and alien clone assassins . i thought it was fun enough . completely predictable , of course , but also fun , which is what these movies are all about . i like dwayne johnson and i really think he could do better as an actor . he does play well in this movie , though the emotional range of his character is epsilon . bottom line : nice family adventure movie , with aliens and kids . and dogs . not alien dogs , though .		7		1
this drama starts from a similar premise of a missing dog , unlike in wendy and lucy -lrb- 2008 -rrb- , instead of looking for her dog , michelle williams is unenthusiastically to make her last effort to rescue her marriage with ryan gosling , this time , what is missing here is her flickering affection to him , which once literally existed . close-up shots , the palette , rookie director derek cianfrance upgrades his documentary backdrops and confidently spreads into - energy realm with an incisive assessment , the aspiration to polarity between the weary couple causes anguish not only to the characters but also to the audience . the incessant before/after marriage texture turns out well operated , yet all the inconsequential conversations saps all my initial exuberant verve . in this case , i would rather prefer 500 days of summer -lrb- 2009 -rrb- with my clarification that i am not trying to eschew from the of life , but simply the latter suits me better both spiritually and mentally . the two-hander performance is unquestionably oscar-worthy , especially michelle , her intrepid interpretation of a mundane girl who is desperately to escape the marriage plight which is strangling her entire life . with regard to ryan , selfishly i think he is some sort of too smug and appealing for his role as an `` underestimated '' mover . both actors ' transitions from lovers to couple were honed to near-perfection , their roles are trite but more visceral and earthly in an audience 's eyes . the film is distressful for any lovebirds who are still in the status and once again evinces the complexities of human being 's deep consciousness , we never know the exact moment when we lost or will lose that feeling , which makes me most dispirited , as anyhow i still bear a scientific heart inside .		7		1
many years ago -lrb- well , 30-odd -rrb- charles bronson , then one of the major box-office draws in the world , made a movie called the mechanic in which he was a paid assassin training up an enthusiastic wannabe , played by jan-michael vincent . for bronson , read jason statham and for vincent , read ben foster . apart from a couple of wrinkles the story stays more or less the same , including -lrb- more or less -rrb- the ending . but expect a lot more violence , blood , and bad language . in fact , it is so sadistically violent -lrb- though not excessively graphically so -rrb- that i am surprised that it retained a 15 certificate in the uk , especially when you consider that there is also a nude sex scene in it . i suppose , in fairness , i should report that this is an absolutely bog-standard action crime thriller - it does exactly what it says on the tin , and adds another entry to his list of hard-man protagonists -lrb- he does one thing , and he does it well -rrb- . my big problem is with ben foster , who seems to be aiming to make a career out of men protagonists . i 'm afraid i ca n't take him seriously . not only is he of diminutive stature -lrb- which , i accept , never stopped tom cruise -rrb- but , without the facial hair which he sports throughout the mechanic , he looks uncannily like nicholas lyndhurst , a british character actor whose long-running character is a gormless twit . here we have a gormless twit , and it just does n't work for me , i 'm afraid .		7		1
end of days is a good movie with a very different storyline and a good cast , with a very strong performance from the always brilliant arnold expected this movie to be an action packed movie with an armageddon type of theme to it , and i was n't disappointed , but i really did n't expect it to be scary , there are actually some very frightening scenes in this movie , mainly any of gabriel byrne 's scenes , and its a lot scarier than some of the ridiculous horror movie you would see today that are n't at all movie is very unpredictable , and i was surprised it got such bad reviews , i really enjoyed it , it certainly was n't perfect , but it did n't deserve any razzie schwarzenegger did a fantastic performance , gabriel byrne was very creepy and believable , and peter hyams did a great job directing this movie , it looked beautiful , none of them deserved razzie certainly not arnold schwarzenegger 's finest film , but fans of the actor will get a great kick out of this movie . as the world reaches the year 2000 , the devil -lrb- gabriel byrne -rrb- is in search of christine york -lrb- robin tunney -rrb- to make her his bride , its not up to police officer jericho cane -lrb- arnold schwarzengger -rrb- to keep her safe .		7		1
this movie , shock , is noted by one thing : it 's vincent price 's first starring role after years in compelling supporting parts for 20th century fox . here , he plays a psychiatrist whose murder of his wife is witnessed by a young woman -lrb- anabel shaw -rrb- across another hotel window as she waits for her returning soldier husband to come soon . the woman fainted from shock when the killing happened so when price becomes her doctor , he and his mistress nurse -lrb- lynn bari -rrb- , try to fix it so everyone would be convinced she 's crazy . i 'll stop there and just say this is such a subtle suspense thriller that anyone expecting the kind of shocks today 's horror/suspense fans get would be very disappointed in this one . since this was made early in price 's career , his character has something of a conscience here . in fact , ms. bari steals her scenes from him as something of a lady character . ms. shaw is also good in her constant frightfulness as she struggles to be heard and believed . by comparison , frank latimore as shaw 's husband is simply adequate as someone constantly trying to see his wife . price himself handles his part capably . also worth mentioning are john davidson -lrb- not to be confused with the singer who once co-hosted `` that 's incredible '' -rrb- as crazy mental patient , mr. edwards , -lrb- loved the lightning sequence that involves him -rrb- and reed hadley as d.a. o'neill who 's questioning of price 's dr. richard cross threatens to drive cross over the edge . i 'd also like to note that the voice of mrs. cross , ruth clifford , was also that of minnie mouse at this time . while she 's not noted on the dvd audio track by john stanley , many of the leading and supporting players are of their lives , interests , and other roles . not great but pretty good for anyone who 's a fan of vincent price .		7		1
harry potter and the chamber of secrets is a worthy sequel . like any good sequel , it takes what made the original entertaining , but does n't rely purely on those things , and instead adds some new ideas to the mix . the result is a fun , fantasy film , that 's even better than the original -lrb- though not by too much -rrb- . once again living with with his cranky foster parents , harry is met by a strange creature named dobby that warns him not to go back to hogwarts . not listening to dobby , harry leaves his house with help from ron weasley -lrb- and two of his brothers -rrb- , and they all go back to hogwarts . though things start going wrong , just as dobby had warned , and by through a terrible tragedy , it is revealed that the feared chamber of secrets have been opened . the most notable flaws in harry potter and the chamber of secrets is its start . the first half hour is fairly week , and a couple notches down from that of the original . the film takes a while to get going , and we also have a most annoying scene with dobby , who - by the way - is one of the most annoying film characters in recent memory . similar to gollum , but without the redeeming psychological aspect , dobby is a short , irritable , havoc causing creature that causes a lot of trouble for harry . and yet , at the same time , we are asked to feel sympathy for the character . impossible ! still , once things pick up , harry potter and the chamber of secrets is a clearly better film than the sorcerer 's stone . the characters are becoming more defined , the harry potter universe continues to develop and expand , and the special effects -lrb- while still sketchy at times -rrb- , are a dramatic improvement over the original . that 's not to say there are n't problems . many new characters are hardly given more than a brief mention and exist purely for fan service . i would 've liked to see more of characters like pomona sprout and colin creevey , and yet , after their introduction , they 're hardly seen from again . one could argue that they were not necessary to the plot , but then why do they need to be here at all ? the acting is good , like in the first , though daniel radcliffe is significantly better in the role of harry potter as opposed to that of the original . rupert grint 's role as ron , on the other hand , seems limited to looking frightened all the time , and he 's completely ignored during the climatic battle -lrb- hermione granger decrease in screen presence is even more extreme -rrb- . newcomer kenneth branagh portrays gilderoy lockhart in one of the more humorous roles in the film . also , special kudos to shirley henderson , who delivers a pitch perfect performance as moaning myrtle . john williams ' score is once again , excellent , though perhaps a bit less so than the original . the themes do n't stand out as much as they did in the first film , but the score is still delightful . harry potter and the chamber of secrets is an improvement over the commendable original . despite the nearly 3 hour run time , the film is n't often dull -lrb- in fact , i found myself more consistently entertained in this outing than in the shorter predecessor -rrb- . it 's funnier , darker , better acted , and more technically proficient than the first film , and the plot is far more unique and intriguing . this is indeed a successful sequel .		7		1

the final film in ` the hangover ' series , ` the hangover part iii ' is a funny third part ! its entertaining , crude & nostalgic . surely , it does n't conquer greatness , but it still delivers an ample of good laughs ! ` the hangover part iii ' synopsis : when one of their own is kidnapped by an angry gangster , the wolf pack must track down mr. chow , who has escaped from prison and is on the lam . ` the hangover part iii ' works , because the screenplay written by todd phillips & craig mazin , is interesting & humorous . there are some nice twists & turns in the narrative & some jokes , through crass & utterly rude , are laugh out loud funny . only glitch lies in its slow-pacing in the first-hour . the pace needed to be more faster ! todd phillips has directed the film , he captures the wildness & absurdity of the film , very well . cinematography is top-notch . editing is sharp . performance-wise : the wolfpack of bradley cooper , ed helms & zach galifianakis are back & they deliver superbly , yet again ! ken jeong is given a lot of importance this time , but he 's very over-the-top . the always excellent john goodman rocks in his portrayal . justin bartha supports well . heather graham & jeffrey tambor are fair . melissa mccarthy is hilarious in a bit role . on the whole , ` the hangover part iii ' is one good laugh !		7		1
this is a well-acted drama about a female senator who is selected to replace the vice president and which focuses on the confirmation hearing in congress . the snag centers around the fact that she is a woman and that she allegedly participated in a frat house orgy in college . joan allen plays senator laine hanson , the chameleon-like gary oldman plays the hostile congressman running the hearings , and jeff bridges plays the president . christian slater , sam elliott , william peterson all play secondary characters . it 's a fine cast . ** spoilers ** my only real complaint with the movie concerns the plot and how we 're given a muddled message about the role of women 's lib . the senator is attacked at the hearings over photos taken of a frat house orgy where it appears she was the main attraction . her defense is to refuse to talk about her personal life . she takes this position in the committee room and on a television talk show . she claims it 's nobody 's business and that the issue would never have come up if she were a man who 'd had sex with multiple female partners . fine , this is a perfectly understandable position to take , if you 're guilty as charged . politics should n't focus on personal issues and there should n't be a dual standard for men and women . but the problem for me was that it turned out she was innocent , that the woman in the photographs was someone who looked like her - she could prove it because she has a birthmark on her thigh and the woman in the pictures does n't . the people who testified against her were relying on faulty memory ; they were remembering the rumors that had gone around and not the facts . the senator could have really slammed the door on her opposition by letting them crawl out on a limb and chopping it off . instead , she refuses to talk about it and gets pummelled . the defense is left up to the president , who finds out the truth after a heart-to-heart talk with her . she withdraws her name from consideration and asks that he not reveal why . the president addresses congress and tears into gary oldman 's character . he laments that politics has gotten too personal and has strayed from the real business of governance , and then announces he wo n't accept the senator 's offer to withdraw . standing ovation . cut to scene of joan allen gleefully throwing herself into her husband 's arms . the female senator did n't save herself or even fight very much in her defense . it was up to the male president to do that , and that 's what i mean by this movie presenting a mixed message on women 's lib . they had the opportunity to make joan allen a much stronger character , and they took the easy way out . a minor point to some since the story is still interesting , but an annoying flaw nonetheless .		7		1
okay , i must admit that this movie was incredibly stupid , offensive and awful ... but somehow i still laughed and enjoyed myself . maybe it was because the film had no pretenses -- it never even tried to be deep or intelligent -- just appeal to our baser instincts . the reason i watched this film is because i loved talladega nights so much . another will c. reilly film sure sounded great -- even if it did n't match the quality or laughs of this earlier film . the film is about two total losers who still live at home with their parent , even though they are 39 and 40 years old . on top of this , they both have the common sense and maturity of 7 year-olds -- very , very slow 7 year-olds ! and in both roles , ferrell and reilly both sounded like little boys in adult bodies -- and this provided a lot of laughs . when both their parents met and married , however , both ferrell and reilly handed it like most immature children -- they sulked and threw tantrums . then , in a strange twist , the two losers realized how much they had in common and became fast friends . the problem , however , is that as friends they both had a lot of crazy and destructive energy -- and perhaps it was better when they were fighting and arguing all the time ! the film manages to entertain because it is well-written , plus the actors seemed to have a lot of fun acting like total idiots . this fun translated to fun for the audience as well . however , i should warn you that the movie is very , very crude -- with lots of colorful language , a pair of fake testicles and lots of sexual references . while kids love will ferrell movies , i do n't recommend this except for older and more mature audiences -lrb- that 's ironic , is n't it ? -rrb- . overall , lots of primitive and crude humor that manages to make you laugh throughout . it ai n't pretty , but it is fun and worth seeing .		7		1
he wrote , directed , and stared in this hilarious film `` high anxiety '' that is based on most of alfred hitchcock 's films . from psycho to the birds , from north by northwest to vertigo , the laughs just never stop in this film . with some terrific actors we also recognize from mel 's best film ever , young frankenstein , you can tell the cast really enjoyed themselves and had fun with this movie . my favorite scene would definitely have to be the imitation of the famous shower scene from psycho , i almost died laughing at the bell boy and his high pitched voice . he was just great . i would highly recommend high anxiety for any mel brooks fan , it 's a funny movie to watch and a guaranteed laugh . this is true mel brooks humor ! 7/10		7		1
i watched this film without knowing too much about it beforehand , which is the best way to get hit by its surprise revelations - so , as another reviewer suggested , do n't read any reviews before seeing it , they 'll probably spoil it one way or the other . it is fueled by the same fear that pervaded the `` invasion of the body snatchers '' films - the loss of one 's individuality . the director 's careful , methodical pacing and his attention to detail may make the film seem slow to impatient viewers , but they pay off in some really chilling moments . katharine ross is extremely engaging in the lead ... and -lrb- not to give anything away but -rrb- i 'll never forget the image of the woman with no eyes . -lrb- *** -rrb-		7		1
two hobbies that i enjoy above most others are going to the movies and puzzles . as long as the latter is n't more tricky and complicated than it really needs to be , and focuses on a point where an average person can ponder over it and figure it out without losing the enjoyment of solving a problem , i am always looking forward to a good brain-teaser . so , as you can imagine , i was very eagerly looking forward to `` memento '' one of the early films of the much-lauded christopher nolan , whom i also have great admiration for . now `` memento '' could be considered more of an avant-garde narrative puzzle than a groundbreaking film and it probably works better on a first viewing than a second , but it had me enveloped from the word go . director nolan and his brother , co-screenwriter jon nolan , took the conventional narrative movement and essentially played it in reverse . the movie 's timeline starts at the end , with an amnesiac -lrb- guy pearce -rrb- murdering another man -lrb- joe pantoliano -rrb- and then photographing his handiwork . may not seem all that extraordinary or new , except that it 's played in reverse , so the polaroid we see in extreme close-up goes from developed to black and the blood on the walls runs upwards instead of down . from there , the picture plays its narrative backwards in section , with black-and-white prologues and epilogues , if you will , providing the groundwork for what will come in between . the story is that mr. pearce is an amnesiac for anything that happened in the past few minutes . yet he 's on a mission to murder the man who raped and killed his wife . could it be the fellow from the beginning ? how would a man with this condition maintain such a task without being conned , used , or targeting the wrong guy ? well , that is one of the great things about `` memento . '' the imaginative if information that it supplies in suggesting how a person with this handicap could accomplish -lrb- or try to , at least -rrb- something of this nature . for instance , mr. pearce photographs his current residencies -lrb- motels , usually -rrb- and the people he 's helping or help , and down notes . they 're notes for the audience as well as him , and that 's another thing that makes this so much fun : audience involvement . it 's up to us to help solve the mystery as well . played in a regular , `` memento '' might have been a neo-noir . to some extent , it might still be , with its elements of a misguided , vulnerable man , a femme fatale -lrb- or is she ? -rrb- , and a mission to murder . but overall , it 's more or less a film of its own kind . one of the best things about christopher nolan the director as well as the storyteller is that he 's like stanley kubrick in this regard : he 's . he makes his movies in a way that is distinctly his own and unlike others , probably part of the reason why he 's admired by some and absolutely despised by others . he 's got an aggressive style that is mostly foolproof -lrb- although i would prefer he learns to frame action in wider shots and ease up on the quick cuts -rrb- and very engaging . it 's always fun to see something new , and so his radically unique style is perfectly matched to this radically unique form of storytelling . the picture is like your favorite jigsaw puzzle , if that 's your thing . it 's most exciting the first time around and still plenty enjoyable once you 've done it a few times and gotten a pretty good handle on which pieces go where and when . it is also very well-acted , with an especially good performance from joe pantoliano as the murdered man , who turns out to have played a big part in the amnesiac man 's life before . as the amnesiac , mr. pearce does a phenomenal job acknowledging one fact and then seeming to forget it a minute later . a picture like this requires a star who can work well with the audience and he succeeds on all levels . carrie-anne moss , as a woman who might not -lrb- or just might -rrb- be helping mr. pearce along is in good form as well , providing flesh and blood to a fascinating supporting character . it 's no wonder why christopher nolan has become one of the more filmmakers of the twenty-first century . again , to compare him to kubrick , he 's and engaging in his own unique way . but it 's more than unique that makes his films , `` memento '' included such a treat . it 's the way he engages the audience . granted , his style is not for everyone . folks who dislike puzzles and mind tricks , beware .		7		1
the great jack lemmon is john gustafson , an ice fishing minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend max goldman -lrb- walter matthau -rrb- for years and years . the battle of wills between john and max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes . max is unaware that john is having serious problems , chiefly that his daughter melanie -lrb- daryl hannah -rrb- is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an irs agent -lrb- buck henry -rrb- . when it seems that john and max may finally put aside their childish rivalry , however , sexy new neighbor ariel -lrb- ann-margret -rrb- arrives and dates both men , pitting them against each other even more fiercely than before . despite their mutual loathing , the death of a friend , john 's problems , and a budding romance between max 's son jacob -lrb- kevin pollak -rrb- and melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile . lemmon and matthau really made grumpy old men great , i hope i am not like max and john when i get old .		7		1
i have n't read the novel behind this , or any other book by ludlum , i 'm sorry to say . you 've probably already heard about the hand-held camera ... yes , it 's pretty much constant in this , even in quiet portions of it , and yes , it can be headache-inducing and straining . the worst is when it makes it downright difficult to make out what exactly is going on . i get that paul was going for a , and trying to make it seem true to life , but dialing it back a tad might have been better . the plot goes beyond what the first one did , and it requires a little more of the audience to follow . in general , this tends to race , without always slowing down to let the viewer catch up . the pace is fast , though not necessarily excessive . this supplements the story of identity well . the new additions are all good . every acting performance is spot-on . the characters are well-written , credible and consistent . dialog is sharp and well-delivered . the action is bigger , the sequences longer and they get messier and less `` controlled '' , without abandoning the special training of bourne . it 's made clear early on that this will be unpredictable and relentless . this is darker than the 2002 film . the score is excellent , again . this takes us to several locations around the world , like liman 's effort . i do prefer his take on the titular icon to greengrass ' , though they both have a lot going for their respective versions . this has some bloody violence and brief strong language . the dvd comes with deleted scenes sans explanation to them , nine concise featurettes , four trailers and a director 's commentary track that is very worth listening through , highly informative and gets into a nice amount of subjects . i recommend this to fans of those who were involved in making it , realistic spy thrillers and/or the franchise . 7/10		7		1
las vegas showroom magician cris johnson has a secret which torments him : he can see a few minutes into the future . sick of the examinations he underwent as a child and the interest of the government and medical establishment in his power , he lies low under an assumed name in vegas , performing cheap tricks and living off small-time gambling `` winnings . '' but when a terrorist group threatens to detonate a nuclear device in los angeles , government agent callie ferris must use all her wiles to capture cris and convince him to help her stop the cataclysm ... cage churns out another movie with no real publicity apart from his hair , but his does have a lot going for it . for one , he puts in a good performance -lrb- which is a rarity now , as he is mostly on autopilot these days -rrb- and secondly , the story is n't as complicated as you would expect it to be . moore and biel provide good support , but this is the nicolas cage show , putting in a little charm into an otherwise lonely man . the set pieces can sometimes be surprising or annoying , depending on how it affects the flow of the film , and there are some amusing moments , especially when cage first meets biel . if the makers had taken the phillip k. dick element from the proceedings , then this could have been more successful , but they had to make it appear to be a serious sci-fi , rather than the hokey ride it is . see it , without rational thought , and you will enjoy the cleverness of it all .		7		1
a moderately effective thriller featuring a capable performance by leelee sobieski as a teenage girl who , along with her younger brother , is taken in by a couple of old family friends after the mysterious deaths of her parents . the story is fairly predictable as thrillers go , but sobieski delivers a performance that has enough spark to keep the audience interested and the production design and the look of the ` glass house ' that they live in are impressive . grade : b		7		1
just had my first viewing of this film and going into it having no idea about it 's content i feel i 've been well rewarded . a splice of genres from director richard donner backed up by two central performances from two of the biggest names of the 90s . i think the overriding thing i take from the film is the story itself , it 's whole conspiracy theme and dark shadowy shenanigans make the film never less than interesting and it compels you to stay with it no matter what contrivances come your way . starting out with a first reel leading you to believe that it 's a comedy first and foremost the film then shifts to such a high gear it kind of submarines you to the point that you feel you have to rewind to see if you are not watching a double bill ! , the pace is up and down and twists pop up at set point markers , but it works well because the story is an engrossing one and i feel donner has done pretty much a perfect job with the material at hand . julia roberts is a safe choice as alice sutton , the role calls for a safe approach , say your lines with credibility and feed off the leading man , she does this with no problems at all , but she really is playing second fiddle to mel gibson 's ball of energy performance as main protagonist jerry fletcher , it 's a twitchy and potent turn from gibson that i feel is vastly under praised in view of his career output . the supporting cast do not fare so well with patrick stewart particularly robotic as the ... is he the bad guy , is n't he the bad guy role , but the film culminates with a good ending to seal the deal and i really think this film is one that will get better with further viewings , 7/10 .		7		1

the story is set in 1944 in spain after general franco 's forces have taken over the country following the spanish civil war . captain vidal -lrb- sergi lópez -rrb- is a brutal , sadistic commander of a garrison of soldiers that has commandeered an old estate in the mountains of northern spain that serves as a headquarters to fight rebel guerrillas and as a supply depot for local villagers to get rationed food . vidal has sent for his pregnant new wife carmen -lrb- ariadna gil -rrb- to join him against her doctor 's advice because vidal believes he should be present went the child is born and is determined it will be a boy . carmen had been a widow and has a 12 year old daughter ofelia -lrb- ivana baquero -rrb- . ofelia is a bookish girl who loves reading and making up fantasy stories . upon her arrival she discovers a stone and instinct draws her to an ancient stone monument in the forest and she replaces the stone to where it once belonged . this sets the stage of the world of the labyrinth that she will become an integral part of to preserve it 's existence . this film is receiving rave reviews from critics and film goers world wide and has been nominated for six academy awards in art direction , cinematography , make up , original score , original screenplay and best foreign film . this is the favorite as best foreign film and could also win an oscar for art direction and make up . guillermo de toro wrote the screenplay from his own story and directs this dark , gloomy blend of fantasy and reality that is also extremely violent . the story is imaginative but fairly weak and full of holes , flaws and inconsistencies . vidal is so perpetually scary and one dimensionally sinister and sadistic with not even a false or pretentious good side to give the character the element of unknown surprise that would make for superb movie villain . although carmen is a central character because of her importance to the story , she is almost incidental . mercedes -lrb- maribel verdú -rrb- is the housekeeper in charge of the estate staff and has a brother who is one of the rebel guerrillas . verdú probably provides the best acting in this cast . álex angulo is dr. ferreiro , carmen 's doctor who is also sympathetic with the rebels in a good supporting role . doug jones in makeup and costume plays the dual role of pan the satyr who dwells in the ancient labyrinth that has three tasks for ofelia to perform and of the pale man , one of the creepiest creatures to haunt a silver screen in some time . pablo adan provides the theatrical commanding voice of pan in one of the great voice-overs of film since james earl jones ' interpretation of darth vader . del toro has woven a tim film here but this would work better as a fantasy film with less violence . i felt the film unraveled at the end and i did n't buy it 's ending . i would like to see more from director del toro but maybe less brothers grimm and lewis carroll in influence . if you want to do a war film do a war film . if you want to do a fantasy film do a fantasy film . some images in this film are overstressed as if to say pay attention because this is going to play a key role later on . okay , okay i get it . get on with it . because of gratuitous , disturbing graphic violence i would not recommend this to anyone . i do n't see the cinematic achievement that warrants the praise this film is getting . it has a lot going for it but it 's not a great film . i would give this 7.5 out of 10 .		7		1
i guess i 've seen enough of jimmy stewart 's ` normal citizen ' movies -lrb- `` it 's a wonderful life '' , `` the story '' , `` you ca n't take it with you '' -rrb- to make it seem unlikely that he could play a strong lead as a western hero . but he made a number of them , and i have to say that his performance here is every bit as professional and workmanlike as some of his better known roles . the story of `` broken arrow '' is somewhat based in historical fact , but as with many , if not most hollywood treatments , there 's also a fair amount of poetic license taken with the characters and situations . a little bit of quick research reveals that cochise was fifty five in 1870 when the story took place , making him somewhat older than the real tom jeffords , who would have been thirty eight , approximating jimmy stewart 's age at the time of filming . what 's fairly accurate is the role jeffords played in bringing about a negotiated peace between the u.s. government and the chiricahua apaches in 1872 , at least for three short years before the treaty was broken , leading to a decade long hostility that ended with geronimo 's surrender in 1886 . while it appears that geronimo and were both part of the same apache tribe in the movie , geronimo was actually born to the apaches . his association with cochise occurred when his chief mangas sent geronimo to get help from cochise to fight the mexicans ; mangas -lrb- red sleeves -rrb- was the father-in-law of cochise . i was quite surprised to see how closely jeff chandler resembled the real cochise in a photograph from the era . in the film , he had that regal kind of bearing that one associates with great chiefs , as attributed by jeffords ' apache language teacher - `` his eyes will see into your heart , he is greater than other men '' . i was also surprised to learn after the fact , that jeffords became a blood brother to cochise , and wondered why it was n't mentioned in the film . as for geronimo , i 'd have to say that this was the strongest acting role i 've seen yet for jay silverheels , completely eclipsing the ` me tonto ' treatment reserved for the lone ranger 's sidekick . his speech to cochise defying peace with the whites was exceptionally well done and convincing . historically , geronimo never considered himself a chief , though he was highly regarded as a military and spiritual leader of the apaches . obviously , i ca n't finish without mentioning the exquisite appearance and performance of the white painted lady , morningstar sonseeahray , as portrayed by debra paget . i wonder how stewart felt performing opposite a sixteen year old actress ? her poise reminded me of audrey 's own somewhat miscast appearance as an indian woman in 1960 's `` the unforgiven '' . `` broken arrow '' has earned it 's reputation as one of the first , if not the first western to treat native americans with humanity . it does so credibly , and is particularly revealing in jimmy stewart 's voice over narrative following the early encounter with the wounded apache boy . stewart 's character is a stand up guy all the way , even in the face of fierce opposition from neighbors and friends . it was with careful consideration that cochise was able to guage the measure of jeffords ' character with the words - `` this white man is my friend '' .		7		1
the gates of hell -lrb- 1980 -rrb- was the version of this film that i saw . it was a gore fest with very little or no plot . when i have seen the original version of this film i will do a review on that . but this is the grind house version of said movie . loosely based upon the writings of h.p. lovecraft -lrb- and the films of this era -rrb- , fulci made a career out of making lovecraftian horror . this one even takes place in the new england area . he switched back and forth from zombie films and lovecraft horror -lrb- probably whichever one was more marketable at the time -rrb- . the story is about an evil priest who 's spirit has returned to wreck havoc on the living and bring hell on earth . a group of nosy people travel to the god forsaken soil of the evil priest and try their best to close the `` gates '' of hell before they are even opened . what happens next ? do they even come close ? what about the chain smoking chris george ? how does he factor in this flick ? what about the attractive catriona ? why did she do several more fulci films ? what about the freaky and bloody set pieces are they cool ? you 'll have to find out for yourself . watch the gates of hell !!! recommended for italian horror films .		7		1
no wonder this a-list movie went direct to dvd with an awful title butterfly on a wheel . good grief ! anyway , mel gibson 's icon productions has made the most interesting kidnapping movie in recent memory . the acting , continuity , photography -lrb- chicago -rrb- are all first rate . the only problem is that after saying the movie is worth your time , any additional comment will spoil it . please find out as little as possible because anything you read will really spoil it . maria bello . oh ! my ! please stop by any time !		7		1
if you 've enjoyed movies like the machinist , then you 'll probably enjoy a movie like stay . it 's one of those well-designed mystery suspense thrillers that leave you guessing for the most parts until its revelation , where things begin to fall nicely into place after bewildering your mind as the movie progressed and strange , unexplainable things start to happen . ewan mcgregor plays psychiatrist dr. sam foster , who takes over a case from fellow psychiatrist friend beth . he inherited a patient named henry letham -lrb- ryan gosling -rrb- who 's on the road to self destruction and to end his life by committing suicide to ape his favourite artist , and telling sam when he 's going to do it . exactly what his motivation is , becomes sam 's obsession and a race against time to prevent it from happening . what strikes you in its presentation from the onset is the ultra-slick editing used for transitional scenes . it 's extremely fluid and blends together disparate scenes so perfectly . but despite looking good , the film got bogged down by its narrative in wanting to dwell unnecessarily on the romantic aspect between sam and his girlfriend lila , played by naomi watts , who seemed a bit too pedestrian in her role as a flower vase type character . upping the ante on the creepiness , the soundtrack is an eclectic mix of dark sounding tunes , and again i do agree with the use of massive attack 's angel to highlight the general mood of strangely calming state of confusion . director marc forster -lrb- monster 's ball , finding neverland -rrb- and writer david benioff -lrb- who wrote the screenplay for 25th hour -rrb- managed to throw some red herrings and caught me offguard a couple of times as i was made comfortably smug at what i thought were plenty of deja vu moments , but not quite . i was waiting for the finale , but it did n't treat its audience as silly folks and did n't resort to spelling out everything in verbatim . every strange thing that you spotted had a reason behind it , and they all come together in a satisfying resolution . even the title has a meaning when you reached this point .		7		1
die hard 2 picks up two years after the first film . john mcclane is back with his wife after moving to los angeles and transferring to the lapd , and now they 're in washington visiting her parents during christmas . mcclane is at the airport to meet his wife 's plane when a group of american terrorists take control and refuse to let any planes land , including the one carrying his wife . once again out of his jurisdiction and facing an incompetent airport police captain , john mcclane finds he 's the only one willing to do anything about the situation , and he sets out to save his wife along with hundreds of other people . die hard 2 is a good follow-up to the first film . die hard 2 takes much of the same awesome action sequences and plot devices and moves it from an office building to an airport , adding some new twists and turns along the way . john mcclane continues to be an everyman type of hero that 's easy to like . he 's fast talking , funny , and he gets the job done . the supporting characters in this movie prove to be awesome allies to mcclane or huge pains in the ass , which is fun to watch . the humour in this movie is just as hilarious as the first film , keeping you laughing between all of the explosions . the only problems that i really have for die hard 2 , though minor , are that some of the action scenes are a little more unbelievable this time around , and the main villain in this film , though really rotten , is n't as exciting as hans gruber from the first film . these two minor problems do n't really effect the enjoyment of the movie though . the acting is still great . bruce willis does just as well in this film as john mcclane . dennis franz is good as the headstrong airport police captain who does n't think he needs mcclane 's help . william sadler is good as the american soldier turned terrorist that mcclane must stop . overall , die hard 2 is an awesome sequel to an equally awesome film . 7.5 / 10		7		1
the informant ! is based on the true story of mark whitacre and adapted from the book written by kurt eichenwald . matt damon is cast as whitacre , a biologist who was placed in the business aspect of adm -lrb- archer daniels midland -rrb- , a corporation that focused on products such as grains and corn . due to the loss of finances in the company there is a suspected mole that may have developed a virus affecting production . the fbi is contacted by the company to investigate the matter . mark , who reluctantly communicates with them over the case , is encouraged by his wife to explain the misgivings of adm itself . he becomes a mole against his own company and is wired up to uncover and record a price fixing scandal that adm has been organising with its competitors . mark servers as a spy for over two years , but it is revealed that he has not been entirely honest with his wife or the fbi . the trailer for steven soderbergh 's film , rather misleadingly reveals many of the informants funniest moments , portraying it as an all-out comedy and a complete spoof of spy films . it is neither of these . instead it feels more like a corporate film , peppered lightly with humorous touches throughout . the weakest elements belong to the opening quarter , dealing with the business aspect of adm. rather shakily the exposition towards the functioning of the company is revealed , but a lot of this is likely to be lost on those who are not familiar with this form of corporate talk . the way that these details are rushed leaves them neither particularly interesting nor satisfying . fortunately , the film improves over its duration , most noticeably when it focuses more on the rather odd character of mark . his funniest moments are undoubtedly those from the trailer where he seems to enjoy playing the role of the spy , like something from all the spy movies he must have seen . he seems to be wrapped in the fantasy of the situation . he shows off his recording gadget to a friend , describing himself as 0014 because he is ` twice as smart as 007 . ' entering into the building he states he has breached the building by talking into his long overcoat and greets everyone by their name and their position as a means of informing the listening fbi . these scenes are very clever with their deadpan humour , resisting the urge to fall into a sense of caricature so as to not the authenticity of the business aspects of the film . mark 's voice over throughout the film is also an interesting access point to this man even if it is not always consistent . at times he comes off as distracted when random thoughts emerge in his head as someone is talking to him . these thoughts portray him as sometimes observant but at other moments purely rambling . more intelligently , his voice over is used to project his fears about the security of his family , revealing the values he holds for his job in having assured support for his family . his sheer naivety in believing he will keep his exact same job , despite ratting out on the company , is one of the real comic touches of the film . as too is the last third of the film , where it becomes increasingly clear about just how deceptive mark has been to not only the fbi but his own family as well . there are a number of very funny twists and turns in the plot for both the characters and the audience . by the end mark comes off as an incredibly deceptive , attention-seeking and a downright sneaky character , more than anything he initially appeared to be . damon is very competent here , quite funny at times and convincing with his rather hilarious naivety . he is almost parodying himself with his now famous role as the super spy in the bourne films . this is not an outstanding film as it is never as funny or brilliant as one would like it to be . there are too many confusing moments in the first half and too much corporate talk for it to be satisfying . yet it is still worth seeing for when it eventually reveals the true colours of its terribly flawed protagonist . the surprises and the humour generated from just how deceptive mark is eventually make this quite an edgy and somewhat enjoyable film about corporate fraud .		7		1
oh nicolas sparks how you make me hate myself , lol . against my better judgement i always find myself getting suckered into one of his books when the trailers for the adaptations come out . and i always throughly enjoy them . he started me off with film versions of walk to remember and the notebook which i surprisingly loved . and than we moved onto the drab , lifeless nights in followed by solid by the solid but flawed last song which made for a good book and movie and dear john which made for a better movie than the book . than came the lucky one and it was just so atrocious i decided to swear off all other nicolas sparks adaptations to come after despite having enjoyed the book . so when the trailers dropped for safe haven i avoided them at all costs and than i was sitting in the movies and i saw one . damn . i fought it for a little while but i eventually ran out and got the book , read it in 2 days and than got excited for the movie expectations in mid to low range . than the reviews dropped wow 11 % positive , yikes . i felt a little discouraged but still intended on seeing it . well i 'm happy i did because despite some huge flawless safe haven was a really good flick . it tells the story of a young woman named erin who flees a troubled past hinted at in the films intense opening and comes to a new town for a new start . she changes her identity appearance and name and goes by katie . she than falls for the widowed shop owner who has 2 kids and than finds out that her past is coming to haunt her . i 'm not sure i should say much more in that . in the book there is one big test and it does n't really work but it 's in the books last chapter so it 's forgivable enough . in the film there are two big twists so i do n't wan na spoil either for you . now i 've read a lot of people who have complained about these twists and i can understand why . however i 'd like to say that the last one is handled much better in the film and the first one despite a slight declaration of faith from the audience does in fact make complete sense if you think about it . i think especially in this film it 's better to not assume and to instead try and think through it . those were not the flaws for me in fact i think they gave the proceedings which could have been rather generic a unique fresh feel . the major flaws for me lie in the films screenplay . it 's a little bit of a lapse to believe that erin 's character could fall for him so quickly especially with the recent things that have happened . there is also not a real solid feel for how much time has passed which makes it all the more unbelievable . on the technical side the editing is pretty hideous skipping wildly from scene to scene leaving many moments unfinished . the cinematography is also a mixed bag there are some shots that are so gorgeous with the lighting , the way they are framed capturing smoke rising from the ground and such giving the film a real feel of realism and than there are some shaky jumbled shots that just feel cheap and rushed . as for the performances julianne hough is better than i expected in the lead but she tends to overact a little but for the most part keeps it reeled in . josh duhamel is well enough but lacks an emotional depth that would have given his character more girth . david lyons is rather good as her psycho ex and mimi kirkland is very cute as lexi and it 's just better not to mention smulders at all . the two leads chemistry is decent but feels more friendly than passionate but the elements mainly work because of the confident direction from lasse halstrom very successful with the cider house rules and dear john and also it 's been a while since we 've seen a sort of romantic thriller in the vein of sleeping with the enemy even though this is a bit more of a drama . not to say it does n't have some suspense i jumped like three times . all in all the film may be far from flawless but it 's a good flick regardless .		7		1
i enjoyed `` kung fu panda '' and am happy to report that the sequel is nearly as funny and smart as the original . the animation is again top class , with bright colours and brilliant facial expressions bringing the characters to life . the story is about the po 's search for how he was separated from his family as a cub and is quite touching and sad at times . shen , the evil character that broke up his family , has returned and is trying to take over china this time . as in the first film there are some spectacular action sequences to keep the kids happy . perhaps there is n't as much smart humour for the benefit of the adults as in the first movie but this is still a great movie for all the family . jack black is perfect as the voice of po and the surprisingly stellar supporting cast -lrb- angelina hoffman -rrb- again do a great job . the ending leaves the viewer almost certain that there will be a third movie , so i 'll look forward to that also .		7		1
i 'm guessing that the world has been screaming out for silent , black and white movies this year in the wake of slow and plodding cinema releases recently like `` hugo '' and `` tinker , tailor , soldier , spy '' . this movie deals with the historical transition from silent movies to `` talkies '' , in the late 1920s , and the effects that this has on an established star of the silent movie era -lrb- george valentin , played by jean dujardin -rrb- . even though this movie is in black and white and is , for the most part , silent , it 's entertaining enough , in its own way . dujardin must be a good actor , because in one scene , in front of a mirror with an attractive woman , he is actually looking at the woman 's reflection and not himself in the mirror ... the narcissistic nature of the acting profession means that that sight is as rare as hen 's teeth . he is also amusing in the moments where he readies himself to be filmed for a scene . the cast do tend to recreate the acting styles of the silent era and one could say , perhaps , that dujardin 's eyebrows are more expressive than laurence olivier 's ever were ... that 's a joke ... not in the sense that olivier 's eyebrows were peerless ... never mind ... dujardin 's face is quite ye olde expressive , even if his eyebrows may not be ... which i do n't remember in any case ! i did enjoy the scene where rising star peppy miller -lrb- played by bérénice bejo -rrb- has a moment with valentin 's coat . nice . the film does lightly touch on some significant moments of the era , like the other event of 1929 . some people just seem born for this era of filmmaking ... can you imagine how big a star fran drescher could have been at that time ? anyway , this movie has some good physical comedy and `` lines '' . many critics are mentioning the dog as being a star of this movie . did manage to predict things in this movie ... e.g. the kind of thing to happen when the feather dropped ... what was in that locked box in valentin 's house . if there is actual sound recording of the cast of this movie acting , that might be fun as a dvd extra for this movie ... i would definitely give that a burl !		7		1
so basically the movie took one theme from the book and ignored just about everything else . they brought in a few events and characters from the book to help flesh out the relationships , but for the most part it resembled the book in so few ways i wish they just made the movie and called it something else . the reason that i did give it a 7 was because of james dean . what an engaging performance . there are so few films of his and this is the only one of his i have seen and i have to say that i am extremely impressed . just based on this one movie i have never seen anyone else attempt to act like this except maybe brando in on the waterfront . i have scene hints of it in joseph gordon levitt in brick , but there are very few instances where an actor just throws himself into the role with such physicality . the rest of the cast did not blow me away , but julie harris was pretty engaging . i respect kazan for not attempting to put too much of the book in the movie and he actually did a pretty good job of only putting what was needed . the main problem is that this is one of my favorite books and i know all of the characters so well . dean 's cal was the only character that lived up to expectations and he completely blew me away . i know this type of acting is dead , but i do enjoying seeing it done well . not a great movie , but i enjoyed it . i think i was engaged with the movie so much because i was interested in seeing how kazan -lrb- and the screenwriter -rrb- would approach the material and specific scenes . one thing i do want to mention that i liked was the scene when cal tells aaron about their mother . it is wonderfully directed scene and is actually a very long shot with some intense acting from everyone . it was well lit and the camera moved perfectly . the framing of the shot where all you can is aaron 's back and hear cal talking was really nice i loved how the scene was executed overall .		7		1
... would never have a family like this , mom , pop , siblings , nephews , and not a single dysfunction between them . this is the waltons and little house on the prairie combined . that being said the central storyline involving binoche and carrell comes off thanks to the writing and acting . probably if you go on the wrong day you could find it a tad cloying overall but again the core is sound and there are just enough one-lines sprinkled throughout to take the edge off the hokey family . juliette binoche does this kind of thing sparingly having got her feet wet in danielle thompson 's opposite jean reno and it 's great to see her letting her hair down . not a but a pleasant diversion .		7		1
the story itself is not thoroughly interesting or deeply engaging . but it 's well directed , well paced and the focus is really well thought . in fact there was much worse to be feared as a vehicle for eminem . people living and craving for hope in gloomy suburbs will find it even more engaging but for the others it will simply sound true as nothing seems to be too obviously cinematographically challenged . anyway if the comparison makes sense to you let 's say eminem 's albums are much better than 8 mile alone .		7		1
if you believe in urban legends , there are some pretty nifty ones out there regarding hotel rooms . you know , the ones about not requesting for a room with a double bed when you 're alone , or to check under the bed , cupboards for erm , extras , or the golden rule to knock before entering . pah ! you may say , but some deem them standard operating procedures as you just do not know the history behind the strange room you 're going to spend the night in . based on a short story by horror maestro stephen king , 1408 is a horror tale about an evil hotel room . it 's so evil , that the entire movie for the most parts is devoted in that single room itself . you can say that the room is the star of the movie , but i 'd rather give that kudos to one of my favourite character actors , john cusack . cusack plays writer mike enslin , whose popular works include his accounts in checking out supposedly haunted hotel rooms , with scientific equipment in tow and a cynical mind , to live and tell the story . he 's a non-believer , but in order to get that regular paycheck , he writes what his audience wants to read . until he got an anonymous invitation to visit the dolphin hotel 's room 1408 , whose notorious history has a series of bizarre murders taking place within the confines of the room . picking up the challenge much against the wishes of hotel manager gerald olin -lrb- samuel l. jackson -rrb- , here 's when things start to really go bump in the night . touted as the room where you wo n't last an hour in , we follow mike enslin as he tries to uncover just what is the mystery behind this evil force is , but like the cynic in him , we start to cast that suspecting eye on mike himself - is he going insane , letting his dark history catch up with him , or is the room truly hell in luxurious settings ? it 's basically jumanji within four walls , as wave after wave of spooky events hit mike , and tests the limits of his sanity . and there are some genuinely spooky moments in 1408 , so credit goes to the film-making team in setting everything up for little climaxes in the narrative . but too much of a good thing tends to make it seem like being stuck in a repetitive loop , and before long , you 'll be crying out loud for the entire episode to end , just like how mike just wants to get out . for a small set , 1408 unleashed total mayhem onto itself , so much so that you suspect it does n't know how to end , falling prey to the multiple ending syndrome , and at one point i was cringing that it could go along the same direction as that nicolas cage stinker next . thankfully , it did n't , but it after too much ingredients stuffed into it , the outcome was really quite bland , that its ending , with great promise , just does n't wow , after the fatigued long drawn route to conclusion . in actuality , what made this movie engaging is that john cusack essentially does a one man show here . fear , despair , desperation , hope , we see it all as his mike battles with the unknown with great aplomb . he does n't disappoint , and one of the highlights is his sparring with samuel l jackson as the hotel manager with an attitude . but do n't hold your breaths for many scenes where they appear together . despite having shared top billing with cusack , jackson got nothing more than a supporting role here , showing shades of his mo-fo attitude , before having the spotlight centered firmly on cusack again . great buildup , effective spooky moments , but overall a rather dull affair if you piece them all together . and one thing 's for sure , you 'll never listen to the carpenter 's `` we 've only just begun '' , in the same light ever again .		7		1
the term `` kiss kiss , bang bang '' was first coined in the 1960s by the japanese press as a nickname for james bond . director shane black loved the term and chose it as the movie 's title because , `` it so clearly represented what this film is . '' and what exactly is this film ? good question . for starters , it 's original . it 's a nice change of pace from all of the sequels and remakes we 've been inundated with recently . i needed this breath of fresh air after being blind-sided by the news that a remake of robocop might be on its way . it 's also funny and action-packed . the pace comes at us almost as quickly as the clever dialogue , making it nearly impossible for the average viewer to get bored . you may be offended , you may not appreciate the dark humor , and you may not get the style , but i would predict the majority of you wo n't get bored . will i refund your ticket money if you * do * get bored ? no , absolutely not . do n't be silly . i 'll just say , `` oh well , i guess you 're just in the minority on this one ! '' what i like most about kiss kiss , bang bang is it 's so hard to `` genre-lize . '' see what i did there ? add that term to the movie mark dictionary . when you ca n't `` genre-lize '' something then you ca n't easily force it into any one specific genre . clever , huh ? that 's what makes kiss kiss , bang bang so fun . is there action ? yes ! after all , it 's by the same guy who wrote the lethal weapon movies . but it 's not an action movie . is there humor ? indeed . the laughs mostly come from the chemistry between val kilmer and robert downey jr. and some of the crazy situations they find themselves in . this is my kind of dark humor . i love to be caught off guard by unexpected moments that make me laugh at things that might not be so funny if they were witnessed in the real world . but this is n't a comedy . the humor is never forced and does n't have to resort to slapstick or flatulent puppies just to get cheap laughs . sure , there 's a scene that involves peeing on a corpse , but it has to be seen in its context to be appreciated . if i were forced to affix a label to this then i suppose i 'd say it 's a darkly comedic murder mystery . it takes itself just seriously enough to keep you in suspense , but it 's irreverent enough to simply be fun and entertaining . it works well enough as a farce without ever coming off as a pure parody . my main complaint is that the story does get a little too confusing . i admit that i openly mocked other reviews that called the story `` needlessly complex , '' but now that i have seen it i totally understand what these reviews are talking about . you 'll want to pay careful attention or you 'll get lost pretty quickly . i 'd even suggest taking notes . if you 're not careful you 'll become so immersed with keeping up with the rapid-fire dialogue that you could lose focus on the plot details . it 's not mind-blowing , but there are just so many characters and minutiae to keep up with that it 's easy to lose track of what exactly is going on . if your friends call you `` ol' goldfish attention span '' then you could be in trouble . i 'm not going to lie to you and tell you that this movie is for everybody . the language gets pretty rough , there is strong sexual content , val kilmer is a detective who just happens to be gay and jokes are made at his expense , there 's a decent amount of gunplay , and some people just might not appreciate the unconventionality on display . but i loved the fact that this was n't formulaic and that the look and style was different than the norm . black admits to the colors in post-production to give the film a crude , rough look . perhaps some might like their movies a little more bright , but i thought it was quite effective at giving the film the pulp detective story vibe that black was going for . i would n't recommend this to my mother , so i wo n't pretend to know whether this fits * your * taste either . it all depends on how you view these kinds of things . is it gratuitous or knowingly over-the-top ? clever or too clever for its own good ? cheesy or comfortable in its self-awareness ? ask yourself what it takes to offend your senses and let that be your guide .		7		1

back in 2007 , a little indie flick rises from the ashes of obscurity and finds its way into the underground pop culture . a small yet charming little story about a 16-year-old giving away the baby still inside her womb won the hearts of audiences and critics across the entire globe . even the story behind the making of the story was something else , as diablo cody , an ex-stripper works her way up from humble beginnings as a well-known blogger . but , with every grand film that makes a surprising amount of money , comes the backlash . the screams of `` overrated , '' `` not that great , '' `` propaganda , '' among other lashes have been hitting this film , and hard . so is juno a film that was riding a wave of praise that suddenly crashes after the hype is gone ? or is it actually a decent film ? i 've had my share of being in the backlash end of highly-praised and lower-budgeted independent movies like sideways , little miss sunshine , and especially -lrb- especially -rrb- napoleon dynamite . however , juno does n't quite fit the mold with the other movies previously mentioned . the story is indeed unique , the characters and their reactions are definitely different , and the script -lrb- despite unrealistic dialogue -rrb- is spectacular in its ability to blind you from what 's happening next . while the morality , themes , and decisions are definitely up for debate and may find you cursing the screen , juno is one of those little movies that can actually deliver . few times can a movie run on purely amazing acting , but juno has easily the best acting ensemble of 2007 and among the best this decade . you should all know the story by now : juno -lrb- ellen page -rrb- sleeps with her best friend -lrb- michael cera -rrb- and of course , winds up pregnant . however , the story twists in another direction because juno decides to give up the baby to a couple -lrb- jennifer garner and jason bateman -rrb- the second it is born , no questions asked . the rest of the movie deals with the struggles -lrb- emotional mostly , rarely do we see the physical side effects -rrb- juno and her closest people face as the baby is one step closer to arriving in the real world . while juno pursues the right ending to the ordeal , the conflict complicates itself , and emotions start running on overdrive at all the wrong moments . one major complaint is about how easy juno treats her pregnancy . to the observant eye , you can see that juno hides her emotional stress underneath her sarcasm and bitter tone . this is the strongest and weakest point of juno : the writing . the script itself contains layers upon layers of great dialogue , subtle themes , smart surprises , and wraps up the whole piece nicely by the end . however , there is such thing as a script being too smart and trying too hard , and diablo cody wrote herself into a corner . juno herself is interesting , spunky , smart , but too smart for her own good . it is almost impossible for a 16-year-old to be able to have any sort of knowledge of the first punk movement in 1979 , especially when it seems like she is the only one in her social circle that even knows of this . her constant pop culture references are to things that existed way before she was born ; her usage of words is much too strong for someone her age . everyone else in the movie is believable , but juno herself is sometimes too over-the-top . while juno is unbelievable , ellen page is not . ellen page does a great job portraying the sly main character , as she can also shed layers of emotion much like the script . however , we can not forget the incredible performances of j.k. simmons , allison janney , michael cera , and best of all jennifer garner . the persistence of vanessa in the movie is perfectly done by garner , who should at least have gotten some sort of oscar nod . the acting carries this movie , and gives it a heavy dosage of realism and gritty passion that you will not find in the typical hollywood flick . the movie tugs at your heart as the final act rolls around and we see everyone trying to be at their strongest spiritually . bottom line : the backlash comes mostly from those who do n't truly understand juno . juno is n't trying to beat a message about abortion over your head , its trying to give you a charming and distinctive tale about having to face maturity several years too soon . juno was forced to `` grow up , '' albeit temporarily , because an `` adult '' event is occurring in her teenage life . yes , her decisions may seem a bit strange , right from the getgo , but that 's who juno is . if we can accept a man killing people while wearing a mask resembling a clown , why ca n't we accept a teenager that enjoys moving furniture from inside her home to the front yard of someone else 's ? with that said , its not the best script in years , like the hollywood underground was saying . the movie was too smart , juno was too smart , and relied a bit too much on pop culture . it 's like family guy , except with actual heart and no randomness whatsoever . diablo cody obviously has the talent , now she has to tweak upon her mistakes made here . juno is entertaining , will deliver laughs , is , and has a delightful little ending . you just want to hug this movie with all its cuteness . this movie is a bit on the overrated end , but is n't disappointing , unlike the average indie flick riding praise waves . if you want a different motion picture experience , i recommend juno .		7		1
going into christopher nolan 's latest film `` batman begins '' , i asserted that my favorite batman film thus far was tim burton 's original `` batman '' , featuring michael keaton and jack nicholson . after walking out of `` batman begins '' , my opinion did not change , but i was left with a lot of hope for this franchise . `` batman begins '' basically takes the story of bruce wayne -lrb- bale -rrb- and starts from scratch ; pretending that the other batman films did n't exist -lrb- which , after seeing the third film , is probably a wise thing to convince yourself of -rrb- . taking cues from the original bob kane story , our new batman still has some of the same background as the burton/schumacher offerings , -lrb- the essentials , like how wayne 's parents die , etc. -rrb- but we now have a truly dark knight . the guilt with which wayne is wracked regarding his parents ' death is so pervasive that he puts himself through grueling and potentially life-threatening events . while in an asian prison , he meets ducard -lrb- neeson -rrb- who works for ra 's al ghul -lrb- watanabe -rrb- . ducard convinces him to join their cult , which teaches him the way of the ninja , only their motives and honor are questionable . returning to gotham city , wayne begins to seek his revenge on the mob boss who runs the city , and was behind the killing of his parents . while doing this , he discovers that there is another dangerous villain , dr. jonathan `` scarecrow '' crane , who drugs his patients and eventually , his enemies , with a hallucinogen that turns them psychotic . helping wayne are his trusty friend and butler alfred -lrb- caine -rrb- and lucius fox -lrb- freeman -rrb- , a former employee of his father who creates wayne 's weapons and gear . since there inherently has to be a love interest , wayne 's childhood friend rachel dawes -lrb- holmes -rrb- acts as both the object of his affection and a source of grounding . it was unfortunate that i went into this film having read a lot of reviews , something i generally do n't do , because pretty much every review i read or heard was a rave , and called it the best batman film ever made , and even one of the greatest movies of all time , period . therefore , i had high expectations going into this film , but came out of it feeling slightly under whelmed . i think i was expecting to do what i did after seeing `` kill bill '' on opening night , and was jumping around , i could n't contain my delight over the film , whereas i walked out of this one and said , `` it was a good movie , but i still liked the first tim burton film better . '' perhaps it 's bad taste or something on my part , but i really liked the art deco and gothic setting of that film , but more importantly , i relished the character of the joker . i have always been one to root for the villain -lrb- a recent example of my hero worship of the bad guy is my assertion that the coolest character in robert rodriguez 's `` sin city '' was kevin , a guy who had maybe five minutes of screen time -rrb- and ra 's al ghul and particularly scarecrow just did n't do it for me . cillian murphy is a great actor , and it was fun to see him chewing up scenery after having only witnessed him in `` 28 days later ... '' , but overall i was pretty disappointed in the villains of this film . having said that , i think that the character development of bruce wayne and his cohorts was definitely superb . by now , it 's cliché to say that this was the vision that bob kane had of the character of batman , but it really is appropriate to reassert this . i was a casual reader of the comic as a child and in my teens , so while i really like burton 's style , i can really appreciate nolan 's creation and bale 's depiction . christian bale is the best batman we 've had so far , hands-down -lrb- sorry adam west -rrb- . he brought believability to the tortured and conflicted wayne , as well as a sense that this could be a real guy . there was nothing cartoonish about his performance ; rather at times i was reminded of an earlier role of his , patrick bateman of `` american psycho '' in his understated ness in certain situations . rachel dawes notwithstanding -lrb- sorry , katie holmes may be cute and all i guess , but she ca n't act her way out of a paper bag -rrb- nolan creates an excellent supporting cast of characters that will serve the franchise well , including gary oldman as a not-yet commissioner jim gordon . caine and freeman are both as good as they usually are , and it is great that they are lending their talents and some class to the series . understanding that one of the main themes of the film was to create groundwork for future endeavors , `` batman begins '' is a very good film . if you look at it from the perspective of a stand-alone film , it could be lacking some key elements -lrb- like the aforementioned villain thing -rrb- . then again , i could just be completely picky and i rely too much on certain things to make a film fantastic . i just know that if there were a bit more dynamism in our bad guys i probably would have given the film an additional point on the ratings scale . but in the film , it really is a good movie and it makes me look forward to the next installment , which means that the film did for me exactly what it probably intended . 7/10 -- shelly		7		1
nick and nora 's infinite playlist - two kids in the various stages of bad relationships , nick and nora -lrb- michael cera and kat dennings -rrb- , meet each other at a concert . they have a night of hi-jinx involving taking care of / searching for nora 's drunken friend and an elusive cult band . this is directed by newbie director peter sollet and written by newbie writer lorene scafaria . this move is cute and at times delightful . the target audience , based on the trailers that preceded it , is definitely girls -lrb- and , judging by who the mass majority of the audience was , they succeeded -rrb- . the studios have hit on the fact that the girls like this michael cera kid . i have mixed feelings about him overall . he 's not an actor . he 's a star . the difference is that actors can play a multitude of different characters , often with the audience forgetting it 's the actor . cera has awkwardness down to a finely tuned craft , but he 's only as good as who he is paired with . and therefore i 'd say the bigger credit goes to kat dennings , who is a fine young actress and i expect big things from her in the future . i did not come out of this hating aaron yoo , a fact that surprised me . kudos to the makers for including gay men in the main cast . this is the 21st century . gay men can and should do more in movies than be bffs to the leading female -lrb- that this movie breaks that mold depends on your opinions of michael cera 's masculinity -rrb- and fashion designers telling anne hathaway how fat and unattractive she is . aaron yoo , rafi gavron and jonathan b. wright provide able comedic support in what i hope is not a career ending move for the latter two . as i said , it 's a cute movie . there are a few moments of lag or predictability and others of questionable character motivations , but it is a teen comedy after all . there is one moment near the end at the recording studio that left me roaring . i would have paid extra for a scene after the credits between nora and her father regarding what happens in that scene . you 'll know what i 'm talking about when you see it . ah it 's probably best to leave it to the imagination . most of the soundtrack to the movie is forgettable , but i 'd take it in a heartbeat over the juno soundtrack . all in all it does n't matter what i say . this movie is going to steamroll everything else in theater . girls are going to see it mostly , but boys who are dragged along will find they had a good time as well . hooray to michael cera scoring another girl way out of his league , thanks to the magic of cinema . good but not great , nick and nora 's infinite playlist gets a b.		7		1
in this historical recreation , a wealthy widow opens england 's first theater to feature nude performers . dench is wonderful as the eccentric widow who hires a temperamental manager -lrb- hoskins -rrb- to run the theater but constantly clashes with him . in fact , the friction between the two feels somewhat contrived and overdone . the early parts of the film work best , marked by humor and playfulness , including a funny scene where dench tries to make a case for the bare market to a conservative government official -lrb- guest -rrb- . then comes world war ii and the mood darkens , causing the middle of the film to drag a bit . the film is rated r for scenes of horror -lrb- war violence and hoskins naked -rrb- .		7		1
a cia agent goes on the run after a defector accuses her of being a russian spy . i really enjoy flicks like these . and salt does have it 's part in these enjoyable movies . salt is a very cat-and-mouse chase type movie where everyone is accusing the woman of being a russian spy and throughout , you see her escaping from them . the action scenes are pretty well-done from fast moving chase to run-and-gun shoot downs . salt is the last name of the woman in the movie for those wondering why such a weird title . salt also has a pretty stupid twist in my opinion , and in some ways , does n't even make sense . but for what this movie is , i 'm guessing i could say it worked . so not much else to really say about this , salt is a highly-entertaining experience and a very well done action movie . although the film is n't groundbreaking and considered to be the best of the year , the film is still worthy of seeing . 7/10 .		7		1
chevy chase , beverly d'angelo , anthony michael hall , dana barron , john candy and randy quaid star in this 1983 harold ramis comedy . clark griswold is a business exec who works in food preserves . he has a wife , ellen -lrb- d'angelo -rrb- and 2 kids , rusty -lrb- hall -rrb- and audrey -lrb- barron -rrb- . he decides to take his family on a cross country trip to amusement park , walley world and gets into mishaps along the way . quaid plays ellen 's cousin , eddie , the late great , candy plays a security guard and christie brinkley also makes an unforgettable appearance . this is definitely one of chevy 's best , he and beverly are great together and i recommend this .		7		1
i still liked it though . warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero . what saves this movie is the set , the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script . i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action , or plot but i got very little . the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film . the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna . she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad . the movie at some points just stood still . you expected something more and you got nothing . al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good . he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy . it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman , and warren beatty in a film other than . i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things . the thing about this movie is it is good , but it could have been so much better . i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool , and visually the movie is amazing , the sets are incredible , the writing is only fair , and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway . spoiler i especially thought the finale was not big enough . it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang . the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere . the movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway . the costumes and makeup were flawless as well . the facial makeup for the villains was great . beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character . still , this is a good movie that could have been much much more . it is to me better than batman , the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time . of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross .		7		1
public enemies . i enjoyed it . i have been wanting to see this for a while now . i am a johnny depp fan and a christian bale fan . the movie is about a notorious bank robber named john dillinger , played by johnny depp . there are only 2 things he loves , his girlfriend billie , and robbing banks . christian bale plays an fbi agent who is determined to catch dillinger . the movie has some really good action scenes in it . i love the bank robberies and i also love the scenes where he tries to escape from prison . this movie is set in the 30s and has that old fashioned feel to it . it is not johnny depps best film in my opinion , i prefer the ones where he is made up not to look like himself ... but it does make a nice change to actually see his face on the screen . i thought christian bale could have been in it more . he does not have anywhere as much screen time as i had hoped . also , he is speaking in a strong accent and i struggled to understand some of the lines he said . but this does not ruin the movie too much . i remember thinking while watching public enemies how in a small way it has a similarity to natural born killers . mickey & malory knox were murderers on the run but the general public grew to love them anyway and were cheering for them to escape the police . the same thing happens here ... dillinger was robbing banks and shooting his gun all over town , but he was loved by most of the public . they protected him . i give this film a 7 out of 10 . great movie , but like all bio pics , how much of it is true ? for more of my reviews please like my facebook page : http://www.facebook.com/pages/ordinary-person-movie - reviews/456572047728204 ? = ts		7		1
like `` wall street '' , which came out the previous year , `` working girl '' is set in the world of world of high finance , but whereas `` wall street '' is a satire on greed and corruption -lrb- it famously invented the phrase `` greed is good '' -rrb- , `` working girl '' - a romantic comedy set in a big wall street corporation - takes a more positive view of the capitalist system . the main character is tess mcgill , one of the corporation 's employees . tess works as a secretary , but is ambitious to rise higher within the corporate hierarchy , especially as she has just turned thirty and has realised that her boss , katharine parker , is slightly younger than her . -lrb- in reality , sigourney weaver is eight years older than melanie griffith , but she looks attractive enough to make this plausible -rrb- . tess , however , is held back by her lack of formal qualifications and by her working-class origins , which are betrayed by her accent , by her clothes and most of all by her hairstyle . -lrb- to say that tess has big hair would be an understatement ; make that enormous hair -rrb- . at first tess 's relationship with katharine is a friendly one . encouraged by her boss , tess even starts suggesting possible deals on behalf of the firm 's clients . things change , however , when katharine breaks her leg on a skiing holiday and is forced to take time off work . during katharine 's absence , tess discovers that her boss has stolen one of her ideas - involving the takeover of a radio network by a client company - and is trying to pass it off as her own . outraged , tess decides to try a deception of her own . with the aid of a new hairstyle and katharine 's smart business suits she passes herself off as an executive in the firm and tries to put the deal together . -lrb- tess ca n't do much about her staten island accent , but no-one seems to notice -rrb- . in the process she meets , and falls for , jack , a handsome executive with the client company - who just happens to be katharine 's fiancé . i must admit that melanie griffith has not always been my favourite actress . her breathless , little-girl voice served her well as a teenager in films like `` the drowning pool '' , but can sound irritating for a woman in her thirties . `` working girl '' , however , is one of her best performances . -lrb- it deservedly brought her only oscar nomination -rrb- . the plot has some similarities with another griffith film from a few years later , `` born yesterday '' . in both films griffith plays a working-class girl who is assumed to be dumb , but who proves to be a lot more intelligent and resourceful than anyone gave her credit for . the film also showed us a new facet to harrison ford 's talents , as he played the hero of a romantic comedy for the first time . this was not only his first venture into this particular genre , but also probably his best - i was never too impressed by his attempt to re-create the humphrey bogart role in `` sabrina '' or by `` six days , seven nights '' . his steady , dependable and decent screen persona , however , serves him well in `` working girl '' . weaver makes a suitably detestable - if desirable - villainess as the devious katharine , and joan cusack gives a good performance as tess 's friend and confidante . there are also some similarities with `` pretty woman '' , another romantic comedy from two years later with a wall street background . neither film might please a strict moralist ; indeed , many moralists took great exception to `` pretty woman '' on the grounds that the julia roberts character is a `` working girl '' in the other sense of the term . in the case of this film , the moralists would insist that two wrongs do not make a right and ask why tess is treated as the heroine when she is just as guilty of deception as katharine is . such moralists would miss the point of both films , which give new twists to old stories . `` pretty woman '' is a modern dress version of the cinderella legend about the poor girl who falls in love with a prince . `` working girl '' casts the heroine in a less passive role - one who achieves success through her own efforts rather than through winning the love of a powerful man . the working class girl ends up on top , while the ivy yuppie is cast as the villainess . it is essentially the dick whittington story with a modern setting and a woman in the leading role , a poor girl rather than boy making good . i also liked carly simon 's theme song , `` let the river run '' , even though it did not seem to have much connection with the story . 7/10		7		1
a crime boss has all the city politicians on his payroll , but must contend with an honest police captain . saddled with an extended and talky exposition , this film takes a while to get going , but then turns into a solid crime drama . as the crime boss , ryan is a mean , sneering , and intimidating figure , a type of role he could have played in his sleep . mitchum is fine as the cop who has the guts to take on ryan . as a nightclub singer , scott not only looks like lauren bacall but also displays the toughness typical of bacall in her films with humphrey bogart , including `` dead reckoning , '' which was also directed by cromwell . it is helped by a good supporting cast .		7		1
in the final dirty harry movie , inspector callahan -lrb- clint eastwood -rrb- is annoyed by his new-found fame , caused by his court testimony against an important mob figure . his next case is a real winner : an obnoxious british director -lrb- liam neeson -rrb- has a `` dead pool '' on the set of his new horror flick . each crew member picks ten celebrities they believe will die , and the one with the most dead celebs on their list at the end of the game is the big winner . just one problem with this - the people on the director 's list start dying at an alarming rate and mysteriously , including his leading man . and guess whose name is on the list as well - yeah , harry 's . if this is n't enough , a tv reporter -lrb- patricia clarkson -rrb- wants to do a big story on him . directed by buddy van horn , `` the dead pool '' is a spoof of a sort , killing a movie critic as part of the story -lrb- ouch -rrb- , and the story actually concerns movie-making . it also has a car chase that 's a take-off on `` bullitt . '' the stereotypical characters found in this type of film are played by some excellent actors , and there 's plenty of sexual innuendo to go around . someone mentioned that eastwood seems a little old here for dirty harry . he seems old for just about every role he plays , frankly , but he keeps playing them . it 's always amazing how men are able to do this with no problem , but give the man his due . he 's a great presence , and in 1988 , his best work as both a director and an actor was yet to come ! very entertaining and well-acted . if you can get the joke , you 'll enjoy it all the more .		7		1
i 've just recently finished michael palin 's second set of diaries taking in the 1980 - 1988 period , which includes some interesting behind the scenes stuff on the making of his python mate john cleese 's most successful film `` a fish called wanda '' . i 'm a big python / palin / cleese fan and knowing the film had a good reputation -lrb- as evidenced by its high average mark here -rrb- knew i was onto a good thing . with old-time ealing director charles crichton also on board as co-writer and director it could n't really fail and so we get a fun frothy sex-farce , where the world 's most eccentric criminal band , - the thief , his stuttering mate , double-crossing american sex-bomb girlfriend and her philosophically stupid lover -lrb- with thanks to peter greenaway -rrb- , inveigle barrister john cleese his archie leach character tellingly named after the real name of the actor who so often played the innocent man swept up by events , the incomparable cary grant , in their attempts to get their hands on a . the plot goes into several different comic vignettes , mostly successful and highly amusing before we get to the happy ending as cleese gets the girl and her the diamond , while stuttering michael palin loses his stammer and kevin kline his body under a steamroller . cleese and palin stand out , the latter in particular in a part , forever the butt of psychotically jealous kline 's scorn and as the plot thickens , a most unusual torture involving fish and chips but not as you 'd think . kline is acrobatic and well out-there pretty much all of the time - for my taste he occasionally overdoes it , while the statuesque jamie lee curtis as usual gets to her underwear and gets to play the hard-boiled tough-talking brainy american female pulling all the strings . she 's effective but cleese calling her the most beautiful thing he 's ever seen is pushing it a bit , plus her costumes throughout just tend to highlight how dated the `` laura ashley '' look has become . the rest of the cast is filled with staples from british stage and screen , tom georgeson -lrb- playing a wittily named character george thomason -rrb- , patricia hayes as a doomed oap witness , geoffrey palmer , maria aitken and even stephen fry in a brief scene near the end . it 's all good lively fun and there are several scenes you 'll remember with a smile . little bits are over-written and overplayed , palin is right in his diary when he asserts that kline 's return outside the plane window is wrong , plus the awful 1980 's soundtrack and fashions date it a little but this is still an entertaining romp peopled by familiar faces having fun with a crazy knockabout plot at which cary himself would n't turned up his nose .		7		1
the idea behind 1408 is actually kind of cute ; a sort of ` what if ' scenario based on what might happen if an inanimate object was given life . we 've all seen child 's play and perhaps the less than desired sequels but here , the inanimate object given life and then forced to fall into the horror genre is a motel room -- a neat and effective idea . following on from other such stephen king adaptations , 1408 adopts the approach of putting someone in an individual location and then allowing events to unfold around them without ever letting them leave : it can be a prisoner in the shawshank redemption in a prison ; a crippled author trapped in a lodge in misery or a haunted motel room you can not escape from as seen here . 1408 begins with an immediacy ; a false immediacy that caught me off guard and worked really well . we get john cusack 's character mike enslin driving in the rain , at night and clearly lost -- an easy , easy set up for a horror film but what follows is him finding the motel he was looking for , staying the night and leaving the next day in some disappointment -- it is an anticlimax , for the character as well as for us as we have been led down a route of suspecting the film will begin its scares from the very off with a familiar set up before having everything cancelled and having the film cut to some bright , colourful shots of people surfing . but the subject matter and choice of editing is the secret here and it mirrors the idea the director has for the anti-climax . a dark , wet and ` spooky ' for the genre night is juxtaposed for shots of the sea and surfers going about their business in bright sunshine . in fact the film goes on and has its ghost hunting author of the lead role state that he has n't ever actually even seen a ghost , which further adds to the now dead and unsuspecting atmosphere the film has decided to lay onto us . it 's these early mind-games and cancelling out what we take for granted that kicks the film off wonderfully well , setting up things to come . but mike is drawn to a hotel called the dolphin , and its infamous room 1408 from which the film gets its title . 1408 is a doomed , cursed room that keeps its inhabitants and renders them insane over time by basically erasing them from the face of the earth ; either that or erasing the face of the earth around them so that the room and the individual are the only things that seem to exist . but while the film is not flawless , the exchanges and that initial thirty to forty minute trip once inside the room has more than enough ammunition to label this a successful horror film . the pleasantries and the introductions are done in a very urgent and dismissive manner ; hotel hot-shot gerald olin -lrb- jackson -rrb- does n't build the room up prior to entry in a ` be careful ' or a ` it 's dangerous ' mannerism but goes the whole hog and simply tells mike it 's a death trap and he will not survive , period . the funny thing is that we have no reason to believe anything that initially happens in room 1408 is really all that bad . the film has given us a series of scenes prior to the main course of a night in 1408 that do not have anything to do with the horror genre , at least not conventionally : they consist of a beach scene where people surf ; a public book signing and a scene in which the lead character checks their mail -- how many horror films would usually have their lead check their mail before heading off for the film 's main plot strand ? but this is what 's clever about 1408 , the ` scares ' at the early stage consist of window 's accidentally shutting on the individual 's hand ; taps breaking off and spraying water everywhere and the alarm radio randomly coming on to the tune of the carpenters . so these events could just be coincidence , indeed even mike comes to the conclusion he has been drugged through the whiskey and complimentary mint after all the fancy build up and is imagining it all , he and us have good reason to believe it could all be fake . one of the other reasons 1408 works is because of its protagonist and how strong and independent they are -- the hero here is not some teenager whose reason to exist is so that they can be chased by a knife wielding maniac , mike is a smart man who seeks these sorts of situations down and indeed uses several methods to calm himself down when everything feels a little too real -- he is rational and realistic . although the best bit about 1408 is what you might come to realise afterwards in the sense it could be a metaphorical journey for mike given what revelations and problems arise , to do with domestic issues , later on . 1408 is his purgatory where he is forced to confront his past demons ; it 's a metaphor for coming to terms with what happened and who he is , especially after so many monotonous in this job as an author . 1408 is a creepy and unnerving film that also comes across as quite smart . in my view , a success .		7		1
watching never cry werewolf again today made me think back to this far superior werewolf movie . it is hard to pull off an effective vampire or werewolf movie . often the creature comes across as silly rather than scary . the best werewolf movies , like the howling , keep the creature in the shadows as long as possible , and allow it to be menacing without throwing it in our face every 10 minutes . sb is an example of a scary -lrb- and fun -rrb- werewolf flick . in fact , the scariest moment in this movie comes when the minister shows up wearing an eyepatch the morning after the werewolf has been shot in one eye with a or firecracker . it also pays to have a terrific cast , as this one does . everett mcgill of the under the stairs and under siege fame makes a great villain , while gary busey and corey haim as uncle and nephew make a great team against evil . the fact that haim 's character is in a wheelchair throughout adds immensely to the suspense and terror . some gore , but no worse than the gore in a film like fright night . older kids can certainly watch this .		7		1
`` the 7th voyage of sinbad '' is n't great art . but -lrb- and this is huge -rrb- , it is great entertainment . pauline kael 's famous quote about appreciating great trash certainly applies here . if you view your films as escapist entertainment -lrb- something we all need once in a while -rrb- , these classic adventure films will certainly please you . before the genre became synonymous with bloated blockbusters or dull cgi medieval fantasies , they were grand costume flicks that wanted nothing but to bewilder their audiences . there 's a certain inescapable charm to these films that manage to still delight audiences -lrb- myself included -rrb- today . many feel this film 's appeal lies in the amazing stop-motion work from ray harryhausen . this is certainly true , because while they may appear outdated to audiences nowadays , harryhausen 's creations have a certain magic that simply ca n't be replicated through cgi . also , the adventure story is romantic and even campy , but is engrossing once you accept it on its own terms . the leads are rather wooden and the characters undeveloped , but who cares ? those were never the reasons people watch these kinds of films . `` the 7th voyage of sinbad '' is one of those films that i can always depend on to cheer me up when i 'm down . -lrb- 7/10 -rrb-		7		1
i 'm not particularly a fan of horror movies and i could n't fix an ailing automobile if my life depended on it so the workings of cars do n't fascinate me ... but this movie fascinated me . the '58 plymouth fury , alias `` christine , '' is absolutely gorgeous . what a piece of machinery ! this is a horror story but there are no ghosts or monsters nor is there any gore . a car is the star of the film , a very jealous and vengeful one at that . man , that sounds silly but , if you 're reading this you have probably watched the movie so no sense going into details . it 's hard to describe the story in a paragraph without it sounding stupid ... but it 's not . maybe the quickest way to explain it is that it is about a car that is alive , like a human , and you mess with it , you pay ! it is definitely one creepy , well-made , unique and always-entertaining film . the car is a lot better than any of the people , sad to say . no , i did n't like any of the kids in this film -lrb- high schoolers who all look 30 years old ! -rrb- and the language is a little too rough in spots , but that can be filtered out . the car , the '50s music , the unique story , the satisfying revenge angle all make this very watchable .		7		1
johnny eager is a model parolee by day and a ruthless gangster by night , doing whatever it takes to get his dog racing track up and running ... including seducing his prosecutor 's daughter . at first this felt like a competent but mediocre picture , but eventually comes into its own , making for an above average experience on the whole . robert taylor is good in the title role , charming and snappy . lana turner has a smaller role than you would imagine and for the first half kinda seems like a non-entity , but has a couple of great scenes towards the end . overshadowing them both is van heflin as eager 's literate lush of a right-hand man , a marvelous performance . although it takes a while for the film to develop interesting angles , johnny 's various deceptions are entertaining , and later on his character shows faint glimmers of humanity . techincally the film is solid but lacking in impressive shots . worth sticking through the lackluster beginning to get to the good stuff .		7		1
criticising pirates of the caribbean is a bit like criticising christmas . it is one of those sacred institutions whereby daring to even utter a word against it leaves one branded a miser and a scrooge with no sense of fun , but the downside is sometimes it is quite apt . now the original pirates movie was terrific , an energetic romp through the high seas that has become one of the classic blockbusters of the decade , but the sequel sadly is n't quite as good . like trying to recreate the childhood magic of the holiday season as an adult , it just is n't as rewarding . not that dead man 's chest is n't a good film , far from it . in fact it 's another highly entertaining ride with enough one liners , set pieces , `` matey '' shenanigans and sea monsters to keep the multiplexes packed for months , but unfortunately it does n't have the zest of it 's predecessor . the main reason for this appears to be a case of over-ambition on the producers part as they have crafted an epic film with multiple plot strands and have sadly succumbed to the same that blighted the matrix sequels . the storyline here involves captain jack sparrow 's -lrb- johnny depp -rrb- attempts to pay off a blood debt to davy jones -lrb- bill nighy -rrb- , commander of a fearsome crew of sea monsters and captain of the fabled flying dutchman . will turner -lrb- orlando bloom -rrb- meanwhile is hired by the east india trading company to retrieve a key that sparrow is searching for in return for pardons for his crimes in the first film . inevitably , turner 's fiancée elizabeth swann -lrb- keira knightley -rrb- becomes involved as well and all three characters set off on their own individual plot lines as they race towards a reunion in the latter half of the film . this may sound exciting on paper , but sadly what it translates to is increasing the running time to a length and the premise . worse , each character is afforded an equal amount of attention and as they all become separated , johnny depp is given less screen time . bad move . jack sparrow was the best thing about the first film and once again , every second he is on screen is a joy to behold . unfortunately , turner and swann are considerably less interesting characters and whenever the storyline returns to them , you find yourself tapping your fingers and waiting for the pirate rogue to reappear . the pacing suffers because of this and there 's a continual sense that much of the fat could have been trimmed to make this as sleek a vessel as the first : an escape from an island populated by cannibals at the start for instance is riotously enjoyable but in all truthfulness , is n't that essential to the rest of the film . that said , dead man 's chest is still a rewarding experience despite it 's faults . alongside depp 's vibrant charisma there are some terrific performances including the return of the ever bickering pintel and ragetti -lrb- lee arenberg and mackenzie crook -rrb- who provide a lot of laughs , plus the foreboding sight of davy jones -lrb- bill nighy -rrb- . his is a villain that easily matches that of captain barbosa from curse of the black pearl , a abomination with horrific arachnid legs and a beard composed of a slimy wriggling mass of tentacles . but the real breakout is from jack davenport , who returns to play the commodore norrington . where once was a man of honour is a drunken , brawling , back-stabbing villain and one of the biggest surprises is that he quite effectively steals every scene he 's in . furthermore , the studio has n't held back on some big budget set pieces . a three way sword fight inside a spinning waterwheel is perhaps the standout as director gore verbinski makes the players throw in a really rough and tumble ride that looks so dangerous it 's amazing nobody was hurt . added to this are plenty of with the kraken , a vast sea monster sent by davy jones to drag sparrow to the bottom of the ocean and numerous clashes with all kind of villains . additionally , they should be praised for making dead man 's chest a significantly darker proposition . there 's an ever lingering sense of foreboding hanging over it and the moody lighting , grim score , themes of damnation and the sight of men having their eyeballs pecked out by crows leave no doubts that the waters are far more turbulent this time around . and let 's not even get into the sub-textual references of jack sparrow falling into an open grave ... in a nutshell then , dead man 's chest is a film all set to divide audiences . the over-indulgence in the running time and the sometimes convoluted storyline do it no favours but these grievances aside , it still makes for a glorious evening 's entertainment with plenty of giddy thrills to remind us all why we love jack so much . just bare in mind that it is the first part of a two part story and come the jaw-dropping cliffhanger ending , you 'll be counting the days till pirates 3 sets sail .		7		1
in new jersey , when dante -lrb- brian o'halloran -rrb- arrives to open the convenience store `` quick stop groceries '' for another labor day , he finds the place on fire . the losers dante and his friend randal -lrb- jeff anderson -rrb- find another job position in the fast food restaurant mooby 's , managed by becky -lrb- rosario dawson -rrb- , and working with the christian employee elias -lrb- trevor fehrman -rrb- . the new and improved potheads and drug dealers jay -lrb- jason mewes -rrb- and silent bob -lrb- kevin smith -rrb- also move their traffic spot to the new location . dante is planning a new life in florida getting married with his fiancée emma -lrb- jennifer schwalbach -rrb- while his friend becky is a woman that does not believe in romantic love . on the eve of dante 's departure to florida , randal decides to promote a farewell and bachelor party to his best friend , and he invites kelly and the sexy stud -lrb- zak knutson -rrb- from tijuana to heat the celebration . however , things go wrong and dante rethinks his future . `` clerks ii '' is a hilarious sequel of the cult `` clerks '' that was the debut of kevin smith . the story follows the usual politically incorrect style of this director , with racist and sexist jokes blended with drugs , gross situations and a romance . however , what else can a viewer expect from a kevin smith 's movie ? rosario dawson is extremely charming in the role of becky , and the witty lines with double sense meanings are very funny . the conventional conclusion fits well to the story . my vote is seven . title -lrb- brazil -rrb- : `` o 2 '' -lrb- `` the clerk 2 '' -rrb-		7		1
virginia wainwright is a new student at crawford academy and she 's part of a wealthy group of close friends that are known as the top 10 . there 's one secret that these friends do n't know about virginia and that 's she survived an accident , which her mother died . after trying resume a normal happy life she starts getting flashbacks of her ordeal and also spells of unconsciousness . while , this is suddenly happening the number of her friends in the group are getter smaller , as they disappear one by one . the authorities are clueless and virginia starts to suspect herself being involved . , what a bluff ! well , now this film does leave you with a lot on mind , i guarantee you . maybe it was too clever and overdone for it owns good , because i was quite liking up until it came to its dawdling final half-an-hour which gets the better of it by catering an climax that 's all bit too silly . it 's more than surprising and ominous , but hardly plausible . the sudden , sombre ending was nicely staged , though . but that in mind , `` happy birthday to me '' is an satisfying and well accomplished slasher that has a lot more going for it than most in its rancid field . director j. lee thompson succeeds in giving the film a magnified touch of slickness , but also amongst the panache is some depth . sure , it does n't make sense at times and there are lapses aplenty , but they try for a little more detail around the mystery instead of a simple stalk and slash vehicle . even the pacing is n't that tedious in the first hour , with enough going on in the sub-plots to keep your interest before the next brutal murder . these nasty murders are shockingly enterprising with a real cruel streak that takes effect in the dying stages of the story . they 're rather blood soaked deaths with some red paint here and there . but obviously it 's been cut down to brief glimpses , but still it has its unpleasant moments within the decent body count . it may not cop out on the frequent violence , but nudity , there is n't ounce of it . the story by john saxon provides enough twists and turns , by throwing the usual red herrings around -lrb- which are rather effectively done -rrb- and providing some psychological edge -lrb- which does n't always come off -rrb- . it does play around with idea that the main lead might have more to do with it then she knows with the latter half of the flick filled with meaningful flashbacks and a change in personality that we see , but her friends do n't . but really underneath that irregular subtext is just another systematic pattern we see in most slashers with obnoxious teens that fit the same old sitting ducks , ah i mean stereotypes , but here it 's handled better . though , the conclusion is totally bananas with a motive that 's pure hokum . you 'll think you got it figured and boom ! there you go . the lead girl might be confused to what 's going on but also the viewer is in the same boat too . also surprisingly the script is efficiently stable with pinch of peculiar humour and the performances are more than adequate . melissa sue anderson shines as virginia and glenn ford adds a touch class as her doctor . on show is a nice looking teen cast too . director thompson orchestrates some well-rounded tension in certain sections and paints a forbidding atmosphere to proceedings . he knows how to work in some great visual jabs and some extensively staged stunt action , but there was some pointless dragging in third act . it became rather laboured where the running time should 've been cut down . the feature nearly runs for two hours , but here there was n't enough in the material to hold for that long . the editing was swift , but it could 've done without certain scenes . if so it could have been an incredibly taut piece throughout , rather than in blotches . the compact camera-work has some neat fixes in building on the mood and disorientating nature of it all . like many of its kind you got the killer cam . backing it up is a strong soundtrack and a rather haunting theme song . some recent slashers owe a lot to this flicks format and i reasonably enjoyed this slasher that i would rank it as one of the better ones , especially from the flooded 80s . above-average slasher that does n't set the world on fire , but delivers a ludicrous outing with more depth and style to boot .		7		1
to tell you the truth , i was n't expecting much when i first saw this movie . i 'm a big arnold fan , but for some reason this was n't on my `` must-see '' list . but after i did see `` end of days '' on its opening weekend , i said to myself `` i have to buy this movie when it comes out on video ! '' well , i did , and i still think it 's a blast . of course , the plot holes become more and more obvious in repeat viewings , but the fun 's still there . this is more serious than arnold 's usual work -lrb- which , despite gratuitous action , borders on comedy -rrb- , but he still manages to squelch out a few funny one-liners . and best of all , he 's paired off with the hilarious comedian kevin pollak . so whenever we do n't have arnold to provide us with comic relief , we have kevin . wow , we lucked out ! there 's one really funny scene , where arnold makes a breakfast shake out of everything he finds in his kitchen -- including a pizza that fell on the floor -- and takes a sip , saying `` they say breakfast in the most important meal of the day . '' he asks kevin if he wants some and kevin replies , `` i 'm good . '' the two of them make a spectacular team , and i hope to see them paired off again in upcoming movies -- even if they have to do one of those tired buddy cop flicks . just watching those two on screen is a delight . and of course , gabriel byrne could n't have played a better satan . there is a memorable scene where arnold comes face-to-face with satan , who 's begging arnold to sell his soul to him . he says , `` he 's -lrb- referring to god -rrb- not going to help you . he just has a good publicist . whenever something good happens , it 's his will . whenever something bad happens , he works in mysterious ways . '' that scene alone is worth the price of a rental . i guess you can say it 's a guy flick . it 's certainly not a date movie ! there 's intense , graphic violence , gore , disgusting images , foul language and one explicit sex scene . so ... be prepared ! you 're not about to watch `` mary poppins . '' as i mentioned there are plot holes -- some subtle , some you can drive a truck through -- but the film moves at such a fast pace that you do n't give a damn ! you 're here for the ride , and what a wild ride it is ! lots of action , some cool music , great one-liners , a creative premise . not an oscar winner , but there 's not much more i can ask for . my score : 7 -lrb- out of 10 -rrb-		7		1
this major theatrical adaptation by disney of the lion , the witch and the wardrobe is not only faithful to the book , but an entertaining adventure film in its own right . it stands right up there with lord of the rings and the harry potter films . four siblings are shipped off during wartime to a distant relative in the country , and quickly discover a wardrobe that opens onto an alternate world , called narnia , populated by talking animals and mythical creatures like griffins , centaurs and mermaids . the ruler of narnia , a wise and compassionate lion named aslan and voiced by liam neeson , is being challenged by the evil white witch , played by veteran british actress tilda swinton , who may be a new face to many viewers here . after various adventures involving a helpful faun , fox and beaver family , a pack of extremely vicious wolves and old st. nick himself , the children join aslan 's army and do battle with the witch and her gruesome minions . the final battle may remind you of the final battle in lord , but keep in mind lion was written before lord . the actors playing the children are adorable and believable as siblings , the actors voicing the animals are for the most part ok , the special effects are seamless , and the music works 90 percent of the time . my only real complaint is the night scenes were much too dark , to the point i literally could not see what was going on in some scenes . i wonder what the director could have been thinking . anyhow , see lion . this big-budget version -lrb- there are two previous tv adaptations and a wonderful cartoon -rrb- would not exist if it were not for harry potter , but lion is head and shoulders above the potter films .		7		1
the world is a pretty awful place if one sees only the bad which is usually all around us . occasionally when there is a disaster , people from all walks of life , suddenly forget who they are and step forward to help out and for a moment , the world becomes a place where all mankind can share in that one brief pause , called humanity . this is one such film . it 's called '' pay it forward . '' the name strikes an immediate note of confusion at first , until one thinks about it . too often when someone does a good deed , most of us feel we should try and pay it back . this is the original concept , except in the film a young student named trevor mckinney -lrb- haley joel osment -rrb- designed it so a person who receives a favor , is then told to pay it forwards to three other people . the idea first began as a school assignment given by his teacher eugene simonet -lrb- kevin spacey -rrb- and encouraged by the boy 's mother arlene . -lrb- helen hunt -rrb- it is not that often when such a simple idea can have such a profound effect and reminds the rest of us , that simplicity is the key to our basic nature . with two academy award winners in the forefront of this film , i fail to see how it was not nominated for an award of some magnitude . ****		7		1
this part 5 of a -lrb- if that is indeed a word and means series of seven or something like that -rrb- . you could n't tell by it 's title -lrb- at least i could n't -rrb- , if you 're not an avid reader of the books . which i 'm certainly not -lrb- guilty as charged , for not having read any of the potter books -rrb- . this one continues the story from the previous movies , also having a short intro in the `` real '' -lrb- human ? -rrb- world -lrb- as the other installments had , always in the beginning -rrb- . this one does have some powerful theme running throughout and yes harry potter begins to grow into adulthood -lrb- one would/could say -rrb- . still not breaking any family friendly rules overall , i 'd say . it 's a good movie and if you 've watched the other four movies , you 'll watch this one too -lrb- there 's no doubt about it ... 3 more years and two more potter movies to come -rrb-		7		1
i have not seen the original from the 1980ies and vampire stuff is not totally for me , but the names colin farrell and anton yelchin did invite me to spend this 1 hour 40 minutes among zombie-like vampires and stuff related to their extermination . i was right about the two above mentioned actors , they are really great , but the plot , directing and another actors -lrb- well , tony collette had too small part to play , she is usually brilliant -rrb- were just above average . there was some kind of tension , but some illogical events and peculiar turns gave the movie shallow undertones . i assume it must be okay for those fond of vampire sagas but when the credits appeared i just shrugged my shoulders - without a desire to see the first movie and to compare .		7		1
i 've been reading previews and articles on legacy for at least a year , possibly 18 months . terms such as ` revolutionary ' , ` landmark ' and ` ' were bandied around in regards to the cutting-edge cgi that was being employed for this belated sequel to the 1982 tron . now after seeing disney 's $ 300m sci-fi epic i can confirm that the 3d special effects are breath-taking for sure and the best i 've seen since james cameron 's game-changer last year , but at `` avatar ¬ - esque '' levels of ground breaking they are not . to even consider attempting to portray a full-bodied character , clu 2.0 , that is meant to be jeff bridges circa the mid 80 's was excitingly ambitious to start with , that director joseph kosinski and his computer effects team very nearly succeeded is enough to make any cineaste giddy with joy . however , as mind-blowingly stimulating as the potential for de-aging actors is , we 'll have to keep on waiting -lrb- and my guess would be for a long time -rrb- for it to be seen without faults . if clu 2.0 never fully succeeds , the other visual feats certainly do . the entirely computerised habitat that sam occupies for majority of the film is marvellous , the light-cycle race sequence worth the price of admission alone . long gone are the days of the original tron where real-life and digital elements clashed , now the line where actors and props start and cgi ends is completely seamless . as fantastic as the effects may be , their bedazzlement does n't reach the next level as the narrative is n't as captivating . screenwriters edward kitsis and adam horowitz noticeably put in the hard yards to achieve a radically unique story . i ca n't find a flaw in their concept , it 's intriguing and worthy of discussion , it 's their execution that leaves a lot to be desired . they unwisely give bridges -- as the weary kevin flynn , not clu -- annoyingly overt zen-like dialogue , lazily coasting on bridges ' own laid-back persona . they also get struck by the matrix reloaded virus and get bogged down in trying to explain everything in the final act . director kosinski cops part of the blame too ; his decision to constantly halt the action with extended segments of character exposé is commendable but they only serve as speed humps . there are a few scenes which should 've been snipped heavily during the editing process that would have allowed the proceedings to be as free-flowing as they deserve to be . where kosinski undeniably gains points though is in his drafting of french musicians daft punk to create a distinctive soundtrack . they concoct a score that can only be described as brilliant and , in a fashion rarely witnessed within movies , their electrifying tunes often hold superior emotional sway than the visuals . in front of the screen there 's a capable , if not overly memorable cast to eke out the diverse players in the tron universe . the suitably good-looking garrett hedlund and olivia wilde provide the gen y component that is necessary in all hollywood blockbusters , with wilde proving she is one to watch for the future . british thesp michael sheen offers up an amusingly , if pointlessly camp performance in what is basically an extended cameo , whilst bruce boxleitner will please the diehards in his reprised role as alan bradley . but it 's jeff bridges everyone will be expecting great things from and as both clu 2.0 and kevin flynn his seemingly effortless awesomeness is evident as always , though neither performance will win him any oscars . a mixed bag that does n't have the all round oomph it should have , but ultimately still deserves to be seen on the big screen thanks to the cgi feast and mesmerizing soundtrack on offer . 3.5 out of 5 -lrb- 1 - rubbish , 2 - fine , 3 - good , 4 - great , 5 - brilliant -rrb-		7		1
i 'm not sure whether or not i like this film . on the one hand , i enjoyed watching it and i respect the fact that it 's tried to be a little different ; but on the other hand , kiss kiss bang bang reminds me too much of the guy at the buffet who fills his plate and does n't end up eating it all . the film is a comedy , a thriller , a murder mystery , an action flick ; a character study and a crime film , all rolled into one . it would be hard for any film to take this cocktail and spin it into a coherent piece , but to it 's credit ; kiss kiss bang bang almost succeeds ; but cracks begin to show where the story is concerned , as the film clearly makes the conglomeration of genres it 's central point , and it 's too easy to get confused . the film is based on a collection of stories by brett halliday , and it follows a petty thief who stumbles into the top flight of hollywood by chance , and soon finds himself part of a murder investigation after witnessing a car speeding into a lake . the investigation includes a gay detective named ` gay perry ' , and his former childhood sweetheart , harmony . the cast is one of the film 's main assets . director shane black is always happy to show off his main star , who has finally made his way back into ` a ' class movies after some ... errr ... time out . downey is a talented actor , and it 's through him that the film gains most of its vitality . he is joined by val kilmer , who is a lot better than i thought he would be in the role of the gay detective . michelle monaghan rounds off the cast , and holds her own against the two bigger name male leads . shane black is most famous for his action films , including credits for the lethal weapon series and arnie vehicle ; the last action hero , but like the film 's main lead ; black has had some time off recently , and this film marks his comeback . some people were relieved to see the predator co-star back in action ... i cant say i share the sentiment , but all in all ; i 'm glad that he has finally made his directorial debut with this film . on the whole , this will appeal to people who like their films to be quirky and offbeat . the style bodes well with downey 's witty performance , and the film is constantly entertaining ; even if it does n't always hit the mark dead on .		7		1
when news first reached me about a new planet of the apes film i was mildly intrigued . after seeing the trailer confusion sort of took over that intrigue . i could n't see the purpose in making an origin story to a franchise that i thought died a horrible death with tim burton 's remake from 2001 . as the release of the film became more and more imminent my skepticism grew . i eventually reached the conclusion that this was n't going to be a great film , but i 'd probably see it anyways . upon its release the film began receiving rave reviews and a glint of hope was then restored in me . and now that i 've finally gotten around to seeing it i 'm very glad i did . rise of the planet of the apes tells the story of the apes first rise to power which , after years of evolution , would eventually lead to the events of the original film . james franco stars as will rodman , a young scientist who is searching for the cure to alzheimer 's . he and his colleagues are testing the serum will has come up with on apes and , due to a mishap in the lab , will is forced to take home a baby ape that has been received the alzheimer 's antidote genetically through its mother . this chimp eventually grows up to be caesar , the highly intelligent ape that will one day rise up to overthrow the humans and take over the world . this film is the account of just how he got there , and wow is it exciting ! this is a film that ripens over time . it starts out fairly slow with a sort of clichéd scientist versus corporation hitch . then caesar is introduced and he starts to grow up and we see his progression over time as he becomes smarter , and therefore more aware of the situation he is in . the script in rise of the planet of the apes leads something to be desired , so a lot of this setup , albeit necessary , gets old . the film really kicks off after an incident which gets caesar put into a prison like ape facility . after this the film spends its time switching between the apes and the humans . as should be the case , i quickly began to care less and less about what the humans were doing with their lackluster dialogue and dull subplots , and i cared a lot more about what the apes were doing . honestly , that 's the way it should be . rise of the planet of the apes does raise one very important question , however . can someone win an oscar for a motion capture performance ? i 'm talking , of course , about the magnificent andy serkis who plays caesar in the film . his portrayal of the defiant ape is possibly the greatest thing about the entire movie . for one , the technical feat of creating such a realistic looking ape through motion capture is astounding , but andy serkis makes it all the more convincing with his fluidly brilliant movement and fantastic facial features which make caesar into more human of a character than the actual humans , who are n't exactly the most developed of characters . the third act of this film is wicked as it kicks off the ape uprising in all its destructive glory . the movie takes off and becomes a truly awesome summer blockbuster . i love being surprised by a movie , and that 's why i so thoroughly enjoyed rise of the planet of the apes . it was so much better than expected , with some really incredible technical feats and gripping action for the last third of the film . there are humans in this film but they are more in the way than anything . it 's all about the apes , and this film certainly delivers in that department . this is definitely a must see for the summer .		7		1
i liked this movie for the most part , but have to say had there been anyone else besides bill murray in the lead role it would not have been as good . he brings an energy to the role that steps this film up a notch than it would have been otherwise . i mainly enjoyed the pranks pulled on the one counselor and there are other humorous things in this movie too such as the hot dog eating contest . this movie would also set the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end . nearly every camp movie has either this or the unruly or troubled kids plot , or a combination of both . this series also would take a rather strange shift in tone as this one and two are both family friendly movies while part three and four are more adult oriented , more like the old teen sex comedies of the time . it kind of did the opposite of the police academy movies that went from r to pg-13 to pg movies . this series goes from the opposite to r. still this first one and only good one is worth some chuckles largely due to bill murray .		7		1
it seems as time rolls on , more and more comedic actors decide to take on a serious roll . most people think this is a trend that has only started within the past couple of years , mainly with adam sandler , ben stiller , or will ferrell . but this has actually be occurring for a very long time . cagney did it , lemmon did it , and even chaplin did it . and in my opinion , i think comedic actors do really great in serious rolls . hopefully the new up and comer jonah hill can do the same . i would n't say that i am a major fan of dark comedy , but i do like it a lot . then again , i think you have to be if you enjoy any of the cohen brother movies . now im not comparing this film to anything the cohen has made , im just using a clear example , because it 's humor does lie within the darkest scenes . what starts out as a typical independent comedy , slowly turns into a serious film . but while maintaining the serious tone , it still manages to hybrid small comedic portions into the dialogue , much like last years `` funny people '' , but in my opinion , this was way better . however , the mood of the movie was kind of conflicting . one moment your really into the seriousness of the plot , and then it takes a slight comedic turn . and it would do this throughout the majority of the film ... . so you are kind of experiencing opposite emotions at the same time , which came off as somewhat confusing because by the end of the film , when they would deliver a punch line , you did n't know if it was trying to be funny or serious , so it made you a little uncomfortable to watch . but , i think there in lies the humor . watching this movie , and seeing the delivery that it was told in , it 's breed of dark humor was packed inside of these tiny little sequences that made you feel uncomfortable . yes it can be both a good and bad thing , but this movie did a pretty good job telling it in the right fashion . as far as acting , john c. reiley in my opinion , is a very underrated actor . he has done nothing but impress me over the years , and he just added another good performance to his resume ' . and jonah hill , did n't give a knockout performance , but still did a good job of presenting himself in a very serious , yet humorous tone . bottom line ... ... it 's a pretty good independent comedy . it 's not laugh out loud hilarious ... in fact , it barely has you chuckling to yourself . and it 's serious side is nothing to rave about . but the combination of both the comedy and the drama , makes this a pretty entertaining movie .		7		1
`` a single man '' was heralded last year as one of the most exquisite films of the year . i would not single it out to that echelon , but nevertheless it 's still a recommended watch for no better reason than the lavish performances from colin firth and julianne moore . firth stars as george falconer , a british college professor who is in a dismal state due to the recent death of his romantic partner jim . george 's best friend is the gabby socialite charley , who also has had her share of heartbreak & melancholy , and constantly relies on george for companionship . one could say mr. falconer is charley 's angel . charley however craves for george to be more like clooney and less like michael by still feeling a magnetic romantic attraction towards him and craves for that feeling to be reciprocated from george . give it up charley , he is not exactly curious george . `` a single man '' is set in one day which george plans to commit suicide . firth is deserving of all the acclaim and awards he received for his leading performance here , even though his stale depressive gaze proclaimed him as the antithesis of the sally hawkins character of `` happy-go-lucky '' , another british film . moore was top notch , and what moore can this woman do to finally get her well-deserved oscar . writer-director tom ford , a novice director who is an acclaimed fashion designer , does fit the part more of an astute writer than a stylish movie director with his effort here ; loved the screenplay , mixed feelings on his direction . i was fond of how he developed the comradery between george and charley . and the flashbacks of george and jim together did provide some foundation to george 's grief . however , ford was out of auteur fashion by highlighting the attraction that george 's college student kenny porter has towards him . porter was portrayed more as a creepy stalker than a young man thirsting for knowledge and guidance . matthew goode was not bad but not too good as jim , and nicholas hoult could have halted a bit his thespian delivery in his portrayal as kenny . the film 's score , art direction , costume design , and cinematography were done elegantly by more than just a single man and woman . so i tip my hat to those involved . it is not a sin to single out `` a single man '' to your `` must see '' list , but i would not exactly go `` ga ga '' in cinematically meeting `` a single man '' . *** average		7		1
phantasm ii sees mike -lrb- james legros -rrb- now residing in ` morningside psychiatric clinic ' after his tales of the tall man -lrb- angus scrimm -rrb- & mutant midgets fail to explain & convince the authorities why his friend reggie 's -lrb- reggie bannister -rrb- house was blown to pieces during the opening sequence . after 7 long years & lots of lying to the doctors mike is set free & immediately heads for the nearest graveyard where he discovers that all the bodies have been dug up & stolen & the prime suspect is the tall man . mike also meets back up with reggie who then invites mike back to his -lrb- new -rrb- house to meet his family , unfortunately as they approach reggie 's house explodes , again . since mike is a bit of a psychic he knows that the tall man was responsible so he teams up with reggie to track him down & put an end to his corpse stealing , mutant slave midget creating & murdering ways . oh , & they would probably like to stop him blowing anymore of reggie 's homes & family members up too . they eventually track him down to a small town in oregon called where he is in the middle of wiping out the entire town , together with a hitchhiker named alchemy -lrb- samantha phillips -rrb- & an attractive woman named liz -lrb- paula irvine -rrb- who both feature heavily in mike 's psychic visions he sets out for a final showdown to the death ... written & directed by don coscarelli this , the second of four phantasm films so far , is probably as good as the series gets . the script is fast paced -lrb- not one but two house 's are blown up within the first 15 minutes -rrb- , never boring or dull & does n't seem to treat itself too seriously which considering the overall silliness of it is a good thing . the character 's are n't developed that much & are a little one-dimensional but they just about come across as likable enough for us to care about them . phantasm ii feels very 80 's with everything done to excess , the car they drive around in , the over-the-top weapons they construct like the home made flamethrower & the double double barrelled -lrb- or maybe that should be quadruple barrelled -rrb- sawn off shotgun -lrb- would n't the recoil alone break your arm ? -rrb- , a chainsaw fight , lots more make-up effects than the original & , of course , the hairdo 's . i 'm not sure about the psychic stuff & if the tall man can make a house explode why ca n't he just , for example , make the car that reggie & mike are driving in explode ? i liked the idea that the tall man travels across america robbing small town 's of the contents of their graveyard 's & as a whole the film worked well & has a certain engaging narrative . director coscarelli piles on the atmosphere & manages to film some cool horror sequences , the death of father meyers -lrb- kenneth tigar -rrb- by the series trademark silver sphere is memorable as it slices his ear off then drills into his forehead & there is a creepy scene when a worm like creature emerges from someones back & starts to talk . the girls look nice & even nicer without their tops on as we get a fair amount of nudity , in terms of gore there is the aforementioned death of father meyers , a sphere impales someones hand forcing them to chop it off with an axe & one works itself into someone 's back & semi exit through their mouth , people are burned alive , embalmed with acid , a rat is blown to pieces & some unlucky guy has a chainsaw shoved between his legs , ouch . made for about $ 3,000,000 phantasm ii easily has the biggest budget of the series , technically it shows with a very well made solid film throughout with some neat special effects , nice cinematography , good music & better than expected production values . the acting is ok but then again look at what these people had to work with , on a side note apparently according to the imdb 's ` trivia ' section brad pitt auditioned for the role of mike ... i liked phantasm ii , sure it 's silly & ultimately is n't going to change anyone 's life but it is entertaining & fun & as far as i 'm concerned that 's the only reasons i watch films , to have fun & be entertained . there are much worse ways to spend 90 odd minutes , definitely worth a watch .		7		1
this remake of the original 1958 horror movie `` the blob '' is a very different one than the original . this movie is much much much gorier than the original . there 's more blood , more violence , more gross scenes , more death , you name it . this movie does not take as long to get to the point as the blob begins to absorb the entire town . some scenes really shocked me . some made me nearly gag . i liked kevin dillon and shawnee smith 's characters . they were n't the typical `` struggling teenager with a complicated life with problems to overcome '' . they were : a teenager on the run who has already lost everything , and a cheerleader with everything she wants . i liked this movie , but it got over-the-top at times . 7/10		7		1
i try to imagine going to the cinema back when `` killer 's kiss '' -lrb- about a boxer reminiscing on unpleasant events while waiting for a train -rrb- was released back in 1955 . certainly , it was a mind-blowing movie - especially the chase sequence - but even so , it probably would have been hard to guess that the director would go on to direct some of the greatest movies of all time . no matter , watching the movie today , one can see shades of what stanley kubrick -lrb- who would have turned 79 today -rrb- later brought to `` dr. strangelove '' , `` 2001 '' and `` a clockwork orange '' . does this one count solidly as a film noir ? that might be a matter of debate . but you ca n't deny that this movie is an important part of cinema history , affirming kubrick as an indelible name on the silver screen . starring frank silvera and irene kane .		7		1
actually , i know many people did n't enjoy the in-laws , but for some reason , i found it to be hilarious ! i am in love with michael douglas , i think he is a very under rated actor and for the most part , his best characters go into comedies . i just loved it when he comes up to albert and says `` you lying to me ? cause if you are ... '' in the scariest voice like he 's going to kill you and he 'll know if you are lying , albert of course comes to his lying defense and says `` no '' ... `` oh , ok ! '' in the happiest response from michael . i feel that you should definitely give the in-laws a chance , it 's a fun movie . if you enjoyed `` meet the fockers '' , then come on ! you definitely will enjoy the in-laws ! 7/10		7		1
star trek 3 : the search for spock is a pretty good movie with a decent storyline but a very strong cast.it 's definitely not the worst in the star trek film series , but it 's not the best either.it does n't live up to it 's predecessor , star trek 2 : the wrath of khan , but it 's still a lot better than star trek : the motion picture.the search for spock still has a lot of great action sequences and although it 's missing leonard nimoy for most of the movie , it 's still delivers very strong performances from the other cast members , william shatner is as good as ever in this movie as james t. i feel huge star trek fans will be disappointed with the search for , they will still get a good kick out of him and wont be entirely unimpressed . captain kirk -lrb- william shatner -rrb- heads off with his crew on the enterprise to the genesis planet to save spock -lrb- leonard nimoy , who also directs -rrb- , who may still be alive .		7		1
after h bomb testing in the pacific , ships start to go missing and a remote island is apparently under attack from a prehistoric monster . japanese scientists hasten to find out just what is going on , what they find is gojira , and he is mightily hell bent on destruction ... . next stop tokyo . gojira is such an influential film , it has spawned many sequels , remakes , , and numerous homages , and of course there is two versions of this film for the viewer to choose from . the american version is a decent enough watch , it has integrated raymond burr into this original versions plot , and although it 's unintentionally funny at times , it holds up pretty well as a no brainer piece of fluff . but it fails to compare to this original honda classic because this has a wonderful ambiance of fear at its heart , coming some 10 years after the hiroshima bomb , the japanese audiences of the time would surely of noted the heavy aura of destruction seaming thru the picture . watching it today , now that it 's restored in all its original glory , is still a memorable and exhilarating experience , the build up is perfect , we are practically on the edge of our seats waiting to glimpse the giant atomic creature , and when shows up for the first time , it gives us a truly memorable classic piece of cinema . sadly the film is hampered a touch by a meandering romantic sub-plot , but the performances -lcb- notably takeshi shimura -rcb- are very engaging , and akira 's score is poignantly perfect . as man in a rubber suit movies go , gojira has no peers , it 's smart , fun , and above all else , memorable , 8/10 .		7		1

bruce willis returns as john mcclane who this time faces off against mercenaries who have taken over an airport and are threatening to have all the plane crashes , mcclane 's wife holly -lrb- bonnie bedelia -rrb- is on one such plane and so it 's mcclane back in action as he ponders how the same thing can happen to the same guy twice . die hard 2 to tell you the truth was a mixed bag . on one hand it had lots of action and a brutal edge to the action but also lacks the suspense of the first . in either case though die hard 2 is not bad as sequels go . indeed even though it 's directed by renny harlin , die hard 2 works in-spite of itself . the only flaw is that the movie is feels too much like a carbon copy of the first film only with a bigger is better approach to the stunts . that being said this is a minor flaw to behold and one really does n't understand the mixed reaction to this film , when the movie is overall very entertaining . * * * out of 4 - -lrb- good -rrb-		7		1
`` the pianist '' is doubtless well crafted and technically and artistically sound albeit naive and conventional . the film into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the nazi reign over the warsaw ghetto , where every german soldier is more evil than satan and every jew a pathetic victim , and one hour of brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the warsaw ruination . only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto -lrb- families torn apart , summary executions , etc. -rrb- . brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film 's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette . overall , the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those polish jews who died in the conflict . `` the pianist '' will play best with those who have not yet had their fill of warsaw ghetto films . -lrb- b -rrb-		7		1
i 'm from the generation that only knew this as the movie that inspired `` against all odds . '' i tried to sit through that just once , but it felt endless and the characters were all really slimy & offputting ; none more-so than james woods . . so eventually i got around to this , and i 'm writing this long after seeing it . i seem to remember it being deeper than movies of it 's era ; just as intricate as you 'd expect from noir ; and long but satisfying . cathy is an amazing character and the phases of her deception play out over generous spans of time . she 's just awful . i do n't think i 've ever been more agitated watching a movie , as when robert mitchum is about to let down his guard in their final car ride . i was shouting at the screen , `` shoot her ! shoot her now ! '' and laughing in the same instant at the movies ability to induce such a frenzy . i love a movie that can draw more than one emotion at once , and other films i admire accomplish something similar . in rear window a second after a laugh , hitchcock supplies the most startling scene in the movie , terms of endearment audaciously mixes bathos with humor , and david lynch 's wild at heart takes the cake with ... well , just see it . unfortunately mitchum could n't hear me yelling . the character of joe is a big closet case . happily following witt around like a lapdog and being his booster . some of the looks he gives witt are lovestruck . very strange .		7		1
i like this movie . it 's fun , cool , and if you 're under ten , its almost scary . the incomparable talent of raul julia penetrates the screen with his charm , audacity , and wit . christina ricci is the unusual daughter , with a sadistic fondness of torturing others . christopher lloyd also has that enigmatic radiance that helps compose this film into a surreal , gothic adventure .		7		1
nothing like a good & indian movie . no john wayne here , but we have charleton heston in this sam peckinpah -lrb- the getaway , the osterman weekend -rrb- film with lots of action as a union army unit and prisoners go after an apache that kidnapped some children . heading into mexico they also come up against french lancers . richard harris -lrb- to walk with lions , cry , the beloved country -rrb- played the confederate captain ; james coburn from the magnificent seven was also included . this film has aspects of the magnificent seven as well as the searchers , and probably many other westerns . check this one out .		7		1
jonathan -lrb- john cusack -rrb- works as a news photographer for a major station in manhattan . one day , near christmas , he reaches for a pair of black gloves in a department store and finds someone else is intent on grabbing them , also . sarah -lrb- kate beckinsale -rrb- , a pretty psychology student , has chosen them for a gift but is willing to concede them to jonathan , as there are no other pairs available . but , jonathan insists that she buy them and they part company . but , a short while later , they meet again on the same spot , mainly because jonathan has left his scarf behind and sara is still shopping . now , declares jonathan , this is fate throwing them together and they should go get a cup of coffee together . they end up at an ice cream shop called serendipity , a favorite of sarah 's and then they head over to the local ice rink . jonathan wants sarah 's digits , despite the fact that both he and sarah are involved with others . but , after writing down her telephone number , the wind wrestles the slip of paper out of jon 's hands . sarah says she believes in fate , too , and that the timing must not be right . so , jon goes his way and sarah goes hers . now , close to seven years later , jon is about to marry beautiful halley -lrb- bridget moynahan -rrb- and sarah is just becoming engaged to lars -lrb- john corbett -rrb- . yet , jonathan suddenly longs to find sarah and see if what they felt for a few brief hours was real . how do you spell complications ? this is a lovely film for those romantic dreamers of the world . perhaps there is only one soulmate for each of us and , if we search long enough , he or she will be found . as the star-crossed lovers , cusack and beckinsale are terrific , touching and sincere . the rest of the cast , including the marvelous jeremy piven , the equally marvelous eugene levy , moynahan , corbett , molly shannon and others , is great , too . the script is imaginative and sweet while the costuming , scenery , and production values are extremely nice . if you have skipped over this one , do not let days or weeks go by before locating it at the video store . it is an excellent choice for those blustery evenings , where tea and a serendipitous movie can make the world 's problems go away .		7		1
- the plot -lrb- and almost everything else -rrb- of ju-on is almost identical to that of the american remake , the grudge . when one of the other social workers does n't show-up for work , one of the newest workers goes to take his place . when the new social worker arrives at the house , she immediately realizes that something is not quite right . what she does n't realize is that the house is possessed by spirits who will kill anyone they come into contact with . - comparisons between the japanese ju-on and the american the grudge are inevitable . overall , i 'm one of the seemingly few who enjoyed the american version more than the original japanese version . maybe it 's just because i watched the grudge first , but i really think it goes a little deeper than that . as i mentioned previously , the plots are almost identical so there 's really no point in trying to pick a favorite . - things i preferred about the grudge - 1 . make-up - i found the more stylized make-up very effective . 2 . flow - as far as non-linear story 's go , the grudge is one of the best examples i 've ever seen . - things i preferred about ju-on - 1 . simplicity - the lack of a lot of extraneous details makes for a tighter movie . 2 . cast - the fact that sarah michelle gellar is n't in ju-on is a big plus for me . - overall , while i may have preferred the american remake , the two movies are actually very close in my mind as far as vehicles of entertainment go .		7		1
`` the hearse '' , is a horror movie is n't quite taken lightly , but it has an interesting storyline to it . here you got a woman -lrb- trish van devere -rrb- who going through a divorce , gets a house in the country whose late aunt used to live . however , when she got there , the people in town give her a cold reception . when they find out who her aunt was , they act very hostile towards her . only the son of the hardware store owner and the preacher of a local church has been kind to her . the reason for the hostility is obvious , the aunt who lived in the house practiced witchcraft . all because of the man she met years earlier before her death . what 's worse is a strange , black hearse that roams the highway at night . and the woman nearly loses it when it comes st her . they said that the hearse crashed off the bridge , and exploded before hitting the bottom . she meets a third kind person in town . but he has a big secret of his own . the house was apparently haunted by the ghost of her aunt , and the highway by the hearse . she was the verge of a serious breakdown . with an relative with a dark secret , you would not honor them for their dark deeds . you cut them out of your life , forever ! this could have used more detail to it , but it was mildly interesting . 2 out of 5 stars .		7		1
hard target is such a blast of a midnight movie that i can almost forgive it for being at times , most times , so warped and awful . it 's got some dialog that will have you ripping your hair out ala dr. scratch 'n' sniff on animaniacs and may have you doing a mst3k even if you 're just watching it by yourself . it 's a surprise that a major studio would let anyone direct a movie like this , but it 's a credit then that not only john woo had the back-up from his catalog of bad-ass hong-kong flicks but that he had the back-up of sam raimi and robert tapert to go on and just go totally bonkers with . it 's an american debut that just flips the bird and does what it wants , and for those looking for a completely tasteless action movie that sometimes makes no sense and at best it will make any guy remotely fans of action movies giddy as hell and occasionally slack-jawed . i should repeat it : this is not a good movie . some of the dialog is just so ... it 's hard to say it exactly , so here 's a quote : '' if you understand me , just grunt . '' actually , that 's one of the better lines ; just wait until villain lance henrikson is going completely *** in the last fifteen minutes of the movie and just spewing out whatever comes into his head ! but hey , let 's face it , if you come to john woo 's film of a jean-claude van damme vehicle you 're bound to just want to get blood , lots of it , and enough explosions and intentional dove shots to make even die-hard fans of the hk flicks go nuts . but even as it gets ridiculous , and there are some real moments like that -lrb- punching out a snake , synchronized explosions including the french uncle 's own house , any given motorcycle stunt -rrb- it 's never less than totally entertaining . indeed , compared to a more serious effort like windtalkers or something , john woo is having a lot of fun as a filmmaker , finding new ways to explode and have his stunt and fx crew waste a perfectly good set to smithereens as his actors make out what is a totally bonkers live-action comic-book . van damme is about as bad-ass as possible throughout , whether doing an inane and illogical stunt or reciting his lines of `` dialog '' -lrb- `` nat , like a bug ? '' -rrb- , and it shows signs of promise that he did n't live up to in the 90s . and there 's even a small chunk of time , the sequence where the black veteran is being chased through the graveyard and through the new orleans streets , that woo gets a solid , non guilty pleasure scene that works totally on its terms . the rest of the time though , hard target is violent in such a way that has now become something of an over-used standard with violent productions ; you can see its influence most directly recently in wanted and in snyder 's direction in 300 and watchmen -lrb- the latter quite out of place with the woo touch -rrb- . but at the same time woo is already such a pro at his own way of doing a stylized action movie , loaded with cranes and dollies in the `` small '' scenes alone , that it 's no wonder when we see the first slow-motion dove go across the screen van damme comments simply , `` yeah . '' hard target is like taking three or four beer bongs in a row surrounded by hordes of drunken buddies and maybe some naked women - it 's not something you would make a habit of , but you got to try it once , just once , depending on the frame of mind and age and excitement of the scene .		7		1
very well made with some very funny comic moments throughout . if i 'm honest , i have to admit i found it did lose a little momentum in the middle third . some nice musical numbers with the stand-out being ` man or muppet ' , i 'm sure those who have seen it will agree . all the performances were very good and the puppeteering top notch , as we 've come to expect from the guys behind the muppets . i must also give credit to the voice talents of ; steve whitmire , eric jacobson , dave goelz , bill barretta , david rudman & matt vogel who provided the voices of all the major muppet characters . there were also quite a few cameos featured -lrb- i 'll leave you to figure those out for yourselves -rrb- . over all i found this quite enjoyable , if a little schmaltzy here and there , but still well worth a look . steelmonster 's verdict : recommended my score : 7.3 / 10 you can find an expanded version of this review on my blog : thoughts of a steelmonster .		7		1
this is what i call a standard `` guy flick , '' and it works . every once in a while , i do enjoy movies where the male characters beat each other at the drop of a hat and use the f-word like punctuation . now , i 'm sure the majority of the reviews -lrb- though i have n't read them yet -rrb- are horrible , because there 's always an added stigma to films that end up sitting on the shelf years after production has wrapped . the plot of `` knockaround guys '' is far from original , yet i was n't bored . for one thing , the central characters are worth rooting for . barry pepper is a good , underrated actor and i liked his role in this movie . as for john malkovich , he 's always fun to watch , even in a role like this where he was severely miscast . as much as it hurts me to badmouth a performance by malkovich , i barely found him convincing as a tough-as-nails gangster . first off , he puts on a ridiculous accent . i 'm guessing he was trying to do some sort of brooklyn accent , but comes off sounding like an old jewish lady . yet i still liked him in this movie -- that 's how much screen power malkovich has . dennis hopper is another actor who 's always reliable , and he does a great job in this movie . seth green obviously does n't have much range as an actor -lrb- as of yet -rrb- , but he does a good job at playing ... well ... seth green . as for vin diesel , i still do n't believe he has any talent as an actor , but since he does n't play a huge role , i ca n't say i minded much . this is n't a movie i can rave on and on about , but it makes worthy entertainment -- in my eyes at least . my score : 7 -lrb- out of 10 -rrb-		7		1
widowed veteran lapd officer abel turner -lrb- samuel l.jackson , in a great performance he does n't get to do that often anymore -rrb- is very happy with his strict routine and lifestyle in the hills . for his own personal reasons , he is way less than pleased when the new neighbors turn out to be college-educated interracial couple chris and lisa mattson -lrb- patrick wilson and kerry washington -rrb- . needless to say , his displeasure will not stay below the surface for very long , hence your story 's growing conflict . a fantastic plot-twisting where the racist los angeles police force is instead represented by a strong , mostly straight-laced black man , the scrutinized , potential hapless victims are either literally white -lrb- as the man in the couple -rrb- or -lrb- both of them really -rrb- and the couple itself is not the norm -lrb- it seems like usually in these mixed raced relationships in tv and movies , the man would be black and the woman white , though this pairing i would guess is n't entirely unusual -rrb- is set up almost flawlessly through the first two-thirds , only to resolve itself a whole lot less so in the third act . director neil labute probably did n't want to burden himself with his usual interest and flair for much more difficult and tough to watch material , often drawn along gender lines , in favor of helming this much more straightforward project that does n't quite expedite itself consistently -lrb- i.e. is this wanting to be more of a suspense film or does it lean toward a message ? -rrb- . much of the supporting cast merely fades into the scenery , with probably the most notable -- by process of elimination -- being 's shy , awkward -lrb- and probably intimidated -rrb- kids and a associate of turner 's played by former nfl lineman -lrb- and fellow ku -rrb- keith . jackson 's performance is clearly the best and most captivating element of the film -lrb- probably his all around best since 2002 's changing lanes -rrb- , and the subject material is plenty to chew on , but the follow-through of the movie , elements and all , lack consistency . maybe more of a renter .		7		1
juno is perfectly entertaining , decently made , there is nothing essentially wrong with juno . the only issue is that there is nothing essentially outstanding about juno either . people are raving about how different and dark and well performed and hilarious ... and none of that is wrong per se except that it 's not that different , dark or well performed . it 's average . it 's a decent comedy , not much more main stream than knocked up , superbad or other comparable raunch comedies . now juno is the receiver of several academy award nominations including two big ones ... best picture and best actress and i 'm just not sure that it is any more deserving than comedies we 've seen that people would laugh off at the thought of receiving academy nominations . but i am not trying to trash the film because it is entertaining and worth seeing and tackles teen pregnancy head on without taboo 's or restrictions which is bringing it a certain amount of controversy and arguments . i do n't believe the film is promoting teen pregnancy at all or even poking fun of it or making light of it . rather i think its saying that this happens ... it has happened to this young girl and this is how she deals and copes . this is a reality , it does happen and at best a pregnant teenage girl might see this and think ... this does n't end my life ... i have options . academy award nominee -lrb- as of today -rrb- ellen page stars as the incomparable and unmatchable juno . page is electric and has amazing on screen charisma and really does make the film what it is . she has terrific comedic timing and her sarcasm is unmatched ... oscar worthy ... not sure about that . the supporting cast is truly exactly that because the film is entirely about her . michael cera , coming off his superbad success , is juno 's to good to be true , young naive love interest and father to her baby . cera is perfect in the role and plays it well and they have good chemistry together although he does n't have a huge role . jennifer garner is good but overly sweet in the role as the potential adoptive mother of juno 's baby . she does however relay the perfect mix of anticipation and fear . jason bateman plays garner 's husband and i do n't know if he was good at it or not . if the goal was to come across as sleazy and creepy then he nailed it but every scene he was in you just expected something huge to come out about him and it never really happens . i 'm not sure he was right for this part . allison janney and j.k. simmons are absolutely terrific in their small roles as juno 's parents . they really do a great job , add some humor and some concern to the situation and they really steal their scenes together . my girlfriend made a good point about this film . it felt like you kept waiting for this major climax , like everything was building to something but it never really comes . she gets pregnant , she weighs her options , she has it , she goes back to being a kid again ... and that 's about it . that makes for a decent story ... sure ... and it is funny and cute and paige is terrific but it 's not the movie of the year nor is it as outstanding as some seem to think it is . i believe that it 's average plain and simple . it showcases some future potential talent and probably more adults find it amusing than teenagers or kids but i do n't think it quite deserves the hype or nominations that it 's receiving . young director jason reitman just stumbled onto this and while he does a decent job telling the story i do n't think he has the experience or extreme talent that everyone raves about . i do n't want to deter anyone from seeing juno because it is a lot of fun and you will enjoy it but do n't expect the best film of the year by a long shot . 7.5 / 10 **************** note yesterday on tuesday january star of big screen hits heath ledger passed away in his home . i just want to wish his family , his daughter , and michelle williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and i always believed he was destined to be a big star . i will most certainly miss his work .		7		1
tension is one of those improbable crime stories from the golden era of hollywood that could easily be mistaken by a modern audience for a poor mystery film instead of a good suspense film . the film is damaged to some extent by a huge leap in logic -lrb- spoilers , as usual -rrb- , that is that the protagonist is able to assume an alternate identity simply by exchanging his glasses for high-tech -lrb- at the time , presumably -rrb- contact lenses . the lengths to which the film goes to explain and exhibit the contact lens technology is comparable to a spy film , and frankly i found it unintentionally hilarious . however once the viewer is able to get past this bit of foolishness the thematic and narrative possibilities opened up by the dual personality premise are enough to keep the story flowing nicely . richard basehart plays the primary character and does a pretty good job especially at adopting a different manner of speech and movement after he adopts the more romantic persona of a perfume salesman -- in his `` real '' life he 's a pharmacist . also in `` real life '' he 's married to , and obsessively in love with , a dangerously loose blonde -lrb- audrey totter -rrb- who runs off with a brawny older man with money -lrb- lloyd gough -rrb- . this motivates warren 's -lrb- basehart -rrb- twisted revenge scheme . we have a good example of the traditional `` good girl vs. bad girl '' dichotomy in this film , with cyd charisse filling the role of the inevitably less interesting wholesome gal . she 's interesting in this film especially for those who 've seen her in her more famous musical roles -lrb- `` the band wagon '' , `` it 's always fair weather '' , etc. -rrb- because she 's so energetic in this film whereas she usually appears as somewhat cold and distant . but in the end there 's nothing interesting about her role . totter is a lot more entertaining , actually providing most of the fun this film has to offer . it 's a remarkably animalistic performance with an emphasis on her appetite -lrb- amusingly conveyed in the early scene -rrb- . she 's a total spoiled brat , and for those who in their comments complained that the `` mystery '' was too obvious , everyone should be aware that this film was clearly designed for a far different purpose . this is actually a pretty good film i think to examine the differences between mystery and suspense . think of the introduction with the cop -lrb- barry sullivan -rrb- and the rubber band -- we 're talking about `` tension '' here . the cop knows that the rubber band will break . it 's just a matter of applying the appropriate amount of pressure at the appropriate time . and that 's what this movie is about , really -- you 're not supposed to be surprised that she is the real killer , but rather about whether or not she 'll be caught and exactly how . in a mystery film you would have the element of surprise , but the need to maintain the mystery would mean that she could never be portrayed in as strongly negative a way as she was in this film . and who could argue about the damage that would do to the film ? i do n't really think this is a film that anybody should be calling a masterpiece of suspense , but fans of the genre including myself definitely get their money 's worth , and in my opinion totter 's performance makes the film worthwhile if nothing else does . i also thought barry sullivan 's performance was quite interesting . he did n't quite convince me that there was a chance he was going to run off with claire -lrb- totter -rrb- , but i believed that claire might be fooled . good show .		7		1
the evil dead films go from horror with some black comedy to a horror and comedy mix to this rather innocent adventure comedy . army of darkness has more in common with hercules and xena than the first two evil dead movies . this does not take away from the fact that this is a faithful sequel . bruce campbell has all the fun as he performs three stooges routines , goes a little gulliver , romances a babe , and kills his evil self twice . the battle of oldsmobile is the highlight as ash takes on an army mixed of ray harryhausen skeletons and knb zombies . the voices , the sliding dagger skeletons , and the hi ho hi ya make the battle super cool . the silliness is sometimes stupid -lrb- shoe laces ? -rrb- but mostly hits the mark , mostly . * evil ash : i am bad ash , you 're good ash . your little goody two shoes ! little goody two shoes ! little goody two shoes ! *		7		1
the story of the mothman is a haunting one . it appeared to the townsfolk of point pleasant , west virginia , in 1966 , and suddenly a lot of unexplained and unexplainable things happened , climaxing with the collapse of the silver bridge over a year later . this strange tale provides the basis for `` the mothman prophecies . '' this movie is chilling , with an eerie tone that sets the perfect mood . the viewer feels this eerie vibe , and has a sort of `` oz factor '' of his or her own . the mothman itself is seen only briefly , as a shocking creature , and you ca n't tell if it 's real or imaginary . the only problem i have with the movie is that the story does not take place in 1967 , when the actual incident occurred . i do n't know why , i just would have preferred that bit of accuracy . and i do n't know if the mothman has ever been spotted outside of west virginia , or before or after the tragedy of 1967 , as the movie implies . but the movie just might haunt you , just as the real story of the mothman has haunted our reality .		7		1
i ca n't say that i loved or hated `` xxx '' , it had it 's high points and it 's low points . there were a ton of little things i did n't like about the film , just tiny little things that i would have liked changed . other than those little things , the movie was pretty decent , for the most part . the action and stunts in this movie is most definitely an overdose , i could n't believe how much flashy stuff was in this film . if you like to see stuff get blown up then you 'll surely like this movie . the only major complaint about the movie that i have is the scene where he 's in columbia -lrb- or where ever he is -rrb- and is riding around on that motorcycle . he was just flying all over the place with that thing , and no ramps or anything in sight . that scene kind of bugged me , but it was over fairly soon and the movie went on . as for the story , it was nothing terribly complicated , pretty much your typical sort of story . lots of cookie-cutter bad guys and what not , but it 's all in good fun . in the film 's defense though , there were a lot of cool things to see . some of the stunts were just phenomenal and a few scenes in particular that just made me grin like an idiot because i liked it so much . also , seeing rammstein in the film was a pleasant surprise . awesome music -lrb- i kind of wish they 'd have used a different song in the film though -rrb- !!! as for the actors , they all pretty much did an ok job . vin diesel was just what you 'd expect , although he did have some pretty bad dialogue in the film . i 'm really shocked that samuel l. jackson agreed to do this film , but hey , that 's just fine with me . i thought he did an ok job , nothing extraordinary , but good enough for me . the rest of the cast was good , nothing to complain about . one other thing i 'd really like to mention is that the trailers gave away way too much !!!! i did n't see a whole lot of television commercials , but i did see the trailers in the theaters , and they gave away just about every cool scene . i was a little bummed , but i 'm sure a few months from now i wo n't care . this review is getting a bit longer than i had expected , so i 'll wrap this up . i thought the movie was pretty good , not as good as vin diesel and director rob cohen 's last film , `` the fast and the furious '' , but still a fine movie . i 've noticed a great deal of people comparing this film to the james bond films -lrb- as is to be expected -rrb- . i would definitely agree that this film is better than some of the older bond films , but i would n't dare say that this one is better than the more recent bond films . so , anyway , if you 're into action movies with lots of explosions and some crazy stunts or just want to see vin diesel with his shirt off , then you 'll definitely want to see this film . if you 're looking for a movie with some real substance to it , this is not the film for you . in any case , i hope you enjoy the film and thanks for reading , - chris		7		1
ever since i heard about the plot of this movie , i really wanted to see it and it did not disappoint . `` beyond borders '' is about the extent of passion that can lead you to take the most incredible chances with life for the good and the bad . angelina jolie and clive owen do a brilliant job in their roles as sarah and nick , they make you believe that they are those characters for real ! i think what makes it more moving is the fact that angelina jolie really is a ambassador and actually makes the attempt to help out the many people in need . i do n't understand why this movie was slammed so much but in my opinion i do n't even think they were really watching it . please watch this movie !		7		1
` youth in revolt ' adapts the first three volumes of c.d. payne 's series about nick twist , a smart and , in his own opinion anyway , horny 14-year-old in oakland -lrb- `` a large , torpid city across from san '' -rrb- who reports in daily journal form on a series of adventures encountered on the way to losing his virginity , despite the obstacles set up by his irresponsible divorced parents . ironically , though pointed at today 's young teens , ` revolt 's ' r rating excludes them -- though the books are far more sexually explicit . whether somehow this will become a cult movie via netflix is hard to say . it 's pretty faithful to the books , leaving out lots , but adding or changing little . unfortunately arteta 's flat direction , and focus on the action aspects -- an accident , a fire , a botched fake suicide , invasion of the girls ' dorm of a french-language prep school in santa cruz -- excises much of the self-satisfied wit of the books and nick 's one flourish , his intellectual and literary showing off . the film necessarily loses the flavor of a , though most of the characters tend to talk in the same ornate , overly-polite style as nick 's entries . c.d. payne is no salinger . his books serve as for young readers , but they 're nothing special . there 's a curious sense of being out of time . is this the nineties , when the books were begun ? -- or the youth of payne himself , who was born in 1949 ? nick 's girlfriend sheeni -lrb- portia doubleday -rrb- 's fascination with belmondo , serge gainsbourg , and the existentialists , -- and the general innocence of the behavior -- would suggest earlier days , but in the movie , people have cell phones , and a of ` shrooms and blunts makes this -lrb- francophile sheeni 's favorite movie -rrb- . the main point was to keep the incidents coming , and payne went on with `` the further journals '' and finally the adventures of twist 's younger brother . young canadian actor michael cera , the star of miguel arteta 's adaptation of this movie , who 's now twenty-one , was already a tv veteran before he was ten . though he appeared in many episodes of the cable series `` arrested development , '' and in retrospect we realize he played the young chuck barris in george clooney 's droll ramble ` confessions of a dangerous mind , ' he reached a kind of nerdy , adorable mega-stardom only a couple years ago with two big hits , ` juno ' and ` superbad , ' followed by the equally charming if less seen ` nick and nora 's infinite playlist . ' what has mike done with his stardom ? well , he played opposite jack black in harold ramis ' slapstick -lrb- and generally panned -rrb- prehistoric comedy ` year one ' and co-starred with his now ex-girlfriend charlene yi in the poorly received ` paper heart . ' cera has good timing and is adept at delivering lines , which makes him well suited for comedy . his limitations in other areas appear in this new outing . he 's both the hero and voice-over narrator , nick twist and nick 's bolder and more dashing imaginary alter ego , francois , who goads him on to bolder action . there is a certain nonchalance in the flat style . under ideal circumstances it might seem elegant . if you could be nerdy and cool at the same time michael cera is it , and girls do find him cute . he rarely appears anything but relaxed . but the high-pitched voice is inexpressive . the range is from a to b , and this is highlighted by how little success cera has in making francois seem any different from nick , despite a little mustache , tight pants , and a lot of cigarettes -lrb- amusingly , puffed on even while running fast through the woods , while nick lags clumsily behind -rrb- . with this new performance , cera continues to seem enormously appealing , but for conventional starring roles , cripplingly limited . he 's just too pale and bland and androgynous , and the more he 's cast as a horny guy the more far-fetched that seems . anything with him in it seems . maybe it does n't matter . you either get it or you do n't , and there are plenty of young readers who insist these are `` the best books ever . '' this is as good a time as any for some lighthearted teenage adventures . -lrb- the adaptation was co-written by gustin nash , the guy who did ` charlie bartlett , ' a so-so movie about a young high school entrepreneur starring anton yelchin . -rrb- ` youth in revolt ' casts some veritable cult actors , who include m. emmett walsh as sheeni 's dad and mary kay place as her mom , steve buscemi as nick 's dad , ray liotta as a cop who gets involved with his floozy mom -lrb- jean smart -rrb- . but the presence of such memorable thespians only emphasizes how little developed their characters are . i liked relative newcomer adhir kalyan as , nick 's erudite school friend and fellow would-be seducer of women : he gives his lines some juice . best of all is justin long , who slides into the scene as sheeni 's sly older brother . he is the only unexpected character . long can always do a lot with a small part , and when he gets a bigger one , like in raimi 's recent old-fashioned horror movie ` drag me to hell , ' he can be equally appealing . and there are others , such as comedy veteran fred willard as an excessively good-hearted neighbor . the director , miguel arteta , did annoying but memorable work with writer mike white in ` chuck and buck , ' and the pair made something very droll in ` the good girl . ' one wonders if arteta was the ideal person to do this job . he seems just to be walking through it . the eighties were the time of the movies that celebrated youth and its many voices , ranging from s.e. hinton and ` ferris bueller 's day off ' to the dark alpha girl portraiture of ` heathers , ' and john hughes ' classics . this lacks their warmth and bite . but i still like cera , and as has been said by a preview audience member , `` his fans will be in heaven '' with this .		7		1
i 'd rate this film higher but it has so many issues against it . your dropped right into the action from the start but given no explanation why , you wo n't find out the reasons behind why a group of men are chasing 1 man until almost near the end of the movie . the main characters are gideon -lrb- pierce brosnan -rrb- & carver -lrb- liam neeson -rrb- with a very small supporting cast . mainly this is gideon being chased from 1 location to another meeting not many people and seemingly falling foul of all the people he meets . also its gideon gradually killing the members of the posse chasing him until it 's just him & carver left chasing each other across a desert where you discover carver was a retired confederate colonel who gideon -lrb- a former union soldier -rrb- who carver had chased to try and find him & his men -lrb- although it 's not really clearly explained exactly why he 's looking for them or what they are supposed to have done -rrb- despite the fact the civil war is over . eventually after gideon orders his men to burn the carver family barn the house accidentally catches fire with carvers baby still inside . carvers wife -lrb- angie harmon in a blink & you 'll miss it role -rrb- runs inside followed by carvers son to try and rescue the baby & the house burns down with them all inside it . this turns out to be carvers motive -lrb- revenge -rrb- for pursuing gideon this distance & in this fashion . there is a brief appearance by anjelica huston as both men are on the desert flats towards the end . we are supposed to assume she is the devil -lrb- there is a hint to the this on her cart -rrb- and that both men are already dead when they reach the desert . the film has a very surreal ending if you can call it an ending & has no real beginning either . the film is rescued from being awful by some very strong acting & stunning scenery locations . worth a look if you have n't seen it .		7		1
we all really enjoyed mr magorium . it has a wonderful sense of magic about it and very good solid performances from the leads . most of all it is the emporium , the toy store that provides much of the wonder : real care , thought , and a real sense of wonder pervade the set . the story is lovingly done , and never too schmaltzy . we came away talking about our favorite bits the kids remembered lots of small details : a sure sign they really did lose themselves in the movies . overall i would say one of the better films for kids that does n't try to be anything other than it is : it reminded me of 1970s disney , simple , innocent , magic .		7		1
if you are a star trek fan -lrb- of which i am -rrb- you will not be disappointed by insurrection . the story is good and the acting is up to it 's high standards the only let downs are the lack of any real great special affects and the lame enemies . i would not say this is as good as first contact but never the less well worth watching . 7 out of 10		7		1
it would appear that in the 21st century , everything old is new again . and perhaps nowhere is that more true than in hollywood . whether it is in remakes or sequels , hollywood has this way of repeating itself . as a result , it seems most unsettling that one of the films from the past that should be remade for a 21st century audience would be a film that , when released near the end of 1971 , caused extreme uproar because of its explicit violence and sexual material . the film in question is director sam peckinpah 's controversial shocker straw dogs , which remains , alongside stanley kubrick 's a clockwork orange , among the most hotly debated films of its time or any time in history . for whatever reason , though , hollywood thought it needed an updating , and so former film critic turned director/screenwriter rod lurie stepped into the shoes of `` bloody sam '' to do it . following both the film 's original source material -lrb- gordon m. williams ' 1969 novel `` the siege of trencher 's farm '' -rrb- and the 1971 screenplay written by david zelag goodman and peckinpah , this particular version was moved from the original 's setting on the cornwall coast of england to a backwater town somewhere along the border . james marsden takes on the role of david sumner -lrb- played by dustin hoffman in 1971 -rrb- , who has come to this small southern town with his wife amy -lrb- kate bosworth , taking over for susan george -rrb- to work on a movie screenplay based on the 1943 battle of stalingrad . and as it so happens , his seeming demure nature puts the redneck boys down there in the position of superiority over him , first when bosworth 's pet cat is found strangled in the closet , then , to make matters even more sinister , when bosworth is raped by her former boyfriend -lrb- alexander skarsgard -rrb- and another man -lrb- rhys coiro -rrb- . marsden , however , comes to his senses when he takes in the local mental invalid -lrb- dominic purcell -rrb- who has unintentionally strangled the daughter -lrb- willa holland -rrb- of the town 's ex-football coach -lrb- james woods -rrb- . woods , coiro , and skarsgard show up on marsden 's property and brutally demand that purcell be handed over to them , but marsden , knowing fully well what will happen to him , purcell , and bosworth , does no such thing . the end result is ultra-violent mayhem in the film 's last twenty minutes . lurie , who made two of the best films of the year 2000 -lrb- deterrence ; the contender -rrb- likely set himself up for a fall in trying to tone down the most objectionable parts of the peckinpah original that made it , in the eyes of some , a `` fascist '' work of art : the rape scene , which is a bit too quickly done and a bit too aimed to show bosworth as a feminist , though she is every bit as traumatized as george was in the original ; and unwisely discounting the idea posited by peckinpah , and based on the works of noted anthropologist robert ardrey , that man 's penchant for brutality and violence , far from the common notion that they would go to any means to protect their `` property '' , is ingrained in him from the start . the other thing that is objectionable about this new version of straw dogs is that , unlike the english village where peckinpah sees the seemingly primitive villagers as every bit the match for hoffman , the ones in this small southern town are the unfortunate stereotypical inbred rednecks , especially woods , who , normally a solid actor , is allowed by lurie to overact outrageously . and the siege , though fairly well staged , is nevertheless so hyper-violent that the audience becomes a tad bit detached , instead of really being forced to confront their inner demons , as hoffman 's character , and to a great extent peckinpah himself , did in the original film . whereas peckinpah was deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking , and not just a blood-and-guts expert , lurie makes the mistake of trying to wrap everything up in a neat , albeit very bloody package . nevertheless , despite these flaws that keep lurie 's film from reaching the nightmarish heights of peckinpah 's , the 2011 straw dogs features solid enough performances from marsden and bosworth , who are able to capture the psychological torment that their characters feel . they are still in the shadow of what hoffman and george did in 1971 , but they are able to bring a certain kind of resolve and emotional gravitas to the situation that lurie does n't always provide in his direction or script . larry groupe 's score , though distractingly loud at times -lrb- this in contrast to the subtlety of the original film 's excellent jerry fielding score -rrb- , also works in those moments where it 's supposed to . the end result is , like many remakes , rather imperfect . still , there have been far worse remakes that hollywood has done , and will yet do .		7		1
renaissance is a dark sombre animated movie about a police hunt in futuristic paris for a young beautiful research assistant . this being sci-fi and french , not all is what it seems , and an intelligent set of stories and characters are blended together to create a rich tapestry of a movie . the styling of the the movie , in my opinion , takes together sin city with ghost in the shell , whilst i found there to be some influence also from the original metal gear solid . filmed all in black and white , the artwork is perfect comic book and works incredibly well . the voice overs are excellent too , and there is little wrong with the movie . however , intelligent as it is , i found that i wanted more from the film in depth in its story , not that it is wholly lacking , but that is a personal whine . regardless , if you enjoy something different to the norm this will easily meet your needs . hope to see more like it in the future .		7		1
the reviews on valiant are horrible . this i find to be a big mistake , i personally loved the film , it 's largest mistake is a lack of a good target audience , it is kinda a silly kids animated film with fart jokes and such , but than it has in my opinion three times as many jokes for adults about world war 2 . in fact i think i may have liked it more than my brothers who are 12 and 6 did . it has some hilarious cracks on hitler and d-day which is usually something that i find impossible to laugh about . the short -lrb- 76 minute -rrb- running time just helps the film because there are only so many jokes it can make without offending someone and it never tries to use one more than once . the plot is filled with holes but is perfect for making all the jokes . the screenplay has some good dialogue and makes all the great jokes . the voice talents are great . the film is well directed but could have been better . the film is perfectly animated .		7		1
plot synopsis : when her friend is killed while being asleep , nancy thompson discovers the killer is a shadowy figure who haunts his victims in their dreams . with her friends being picked off one by one , nancy must confront the killer in his domain . when `` halloween '' came out in 1978 , it spawned a very prolific genre known as the slasher film . in a slasher film , a group of characters , mostly teenagers , are stalked & killed by a shadowy bogeyman who usually has an axe to grind . by the time `` elm street '' came along , the well had been sucked dry by dozens of poor-quality films . wes craven gives us a film that is purely nightmarish -lrb- okay , bad pun -rrb- & very clever . while it is not the masterpiece that it 's fans are claiming to be , it is nonetheless a classic , giving birth to a character that became a legend in the horror genre : freddy krueger , a child murderer who was killed by an angry mob & who gets his revenge by killing his victims in their dreams . the acting is all over the place , with the teenagers being the usual round of morons that we have seen in other films , but robert englund commands the screen as krueger .		7		1
ghost ship starts as artic weather patrol pilot jack ferriman -lrb- desmond harrington -rrb- approaches captain sean murphy -lrb- gabriel byrne -rrb- & his crew of professional 's , jack says that while flying his route over a remote part of the bering sea he spotted a huge seemingly abandoned ship & that if they cut him in on the salvage money he 'll show them where it is . murphy & his crew agree & they set sail , they find the boat which happens to a huge italian cruise liner called the antonia graza which mysteriously disappeared in 1962 without trace . as salvage the antonio graza is worth a fortune so they quickly set about getting back to dock , however in an accident their own boat is blown to pieces so they are stuck on the antonia graza . to make matters worse it has a huge hole in it & will sink within a few days , then there 's the strange ghostly goings on which become ever more unpleasant & deadly as the truth behind the ship 's dark past is revealed ... this american australian co-production was directed by steve beck for the then newly formed dark castle entertainment production company , ghost ship was the third film from dark castle following the two remake 's house on haunted hill -lrb- 1999 -rrb- & thir13en ghosts -lrb- 2001 -rrb- both of which were perfectly entertaining films , ghost ship was the first of their films to be based on an original idea although i use the word original rather lightly . anyway , the script here by mark hanlon & john pogue is reasonable fun & makes for a decent enough haunted ship chiller . it moves along at a nice pace although by the end of the film i was becoming bored of seeing people randomly walk around dark corridors , luckily to balance these scenes things always seem to happen to them at some point so all the walking around to pad the running time out does have it 's pay-off which is nice . the character 's are a touch one dimensional but no ones going to watch a film called ghost ship & expect anything deep or meaningful , are they ? i must admit i quite liked the satisfying twist ending -lrb- s -rrb- & i did n't see it coming either , i also liked the back-story given to the ghost ship with the haunted & cursed gold & the events of it 's dark past . so what we have in a nutshell is a decent teen horror with some gory moments , a fair amount of bad language some gratuitous nudity & a run time that does n't outstay it 's welcome , i liked it because it entertained me & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . director beck ok , the film is nice enough to look at & there are a few stylish scenes especially the niftily edited fun flashback when the original passengers were killed . this film is not a remake of or has any connection to either the ghost ship -lrb- 1943 -rrb- or ghost ship -lrb- 1952 -rrb- & in fact has more in common with death ship -lrb- 1981 -rrb- although they are still two very different films . there 's some gore here although after the initial showstopper gore filled scene at the start it becomes surprisingly tame , expect for that totally cool opening massacre there 's a slit throat , some gory gunshot wounds , someone is literally mashed to pieces between to huge cogs & someone swings when they get a crane hook stuck under their chin . with a supposed budget of about $ 35,000,000 this had a decent budget but when compared to the $ 100,000,000 plus budgets of the biggest hollywood productions it pales into comparison , it 's well made which is alright but it can feel a bit too ` staged ' at times if you know what i mean . the cgi effects are good , the make-up effects are as well & it has good production values . the acting is serviceable , most of the bland cast members put in forgettable if adequate performances . the only actor with any class here is byrne who does ok . ghost ship is an enjoyable big budget popcorn special effects laden horror which provides both a fair amount of undemanding fun & entertainment , well that 's my opinion anyway & i 'm sticking to it !		7		1
escaping the life of being pimped by her father -lrb- . . and the speakeasy waitressing -rrb- who dies in an explosion , lily powers -lrb- barbara stanwyck , who is simply ravishing -rrb- sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city gotham . when a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law -lrb- and lily 's new lover -rrb- , the sky 's the limit for lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay does n't come into her hands . newly appointed president to the bank , courtland trenholm -lrb- george brent -rrb- , sends lily to paris instead of forking over lots of dough , but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the city of love . this makes lily 's mouth water as now she 'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way . though , circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches . . trenholm , now her husband , is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank . he needs money lily now has in her possession or he 'll have absolutely nothing . stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual warner brothers polish . being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy . good direction from alfred e green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act . obviously the film shows that money is n't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of lily 's dead heart . that ending having lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love did n't ring true to me . she 's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him .		7		1
i 've heard that this film is notoriously unwatchable ; i 've heard that it is one of the greatest moving pictures of all time . given my negative experience of other ` great experimental ' classics -- `` napoleon '' , `` metropolis '' , `` greed '' -- i had a suspicion that my own reaction might lie on the former end of the scale : but when the chance to see it presented itself , i felt i ought to take the opportunity . to further my cinematic education , if nothing else . oddly enough , while it seems to be a film that normally evokes a violent response in one direction or the other , i found myself left floating mildly in the middle . i did n't think it was the greatest film ever made , but i did n't find it unwatchable either . on the most basic level , i ca n't help feeling that dreyer picked one of the most unsuitable subjects for a silent film possible : a dramatization of a verbal transcript ! i can see the trial of joan of arc being presented as an effective radio drama , along the lines of dorothy l. sayers ' , `` the man born to be king '' , but trying to make a silent movie out of it produces a horribly forced format : the courtroom scenes consist entirely of mouthed dialogue shown on transcribed title cards , followed by incredibly prolonged reaction shots . the -lrb- no doubt unintended -rrb- impression given was that the reaction shots were only there to break up what would otherwise be an unbroken series of intertitles , rather than being an active artistic choice : certainly joan must have been an incredibly uncooperative witness if it really took her that long to answer each question . the format just does n't seem to fit the content : ` talky ' silent films are generally a mistake , and this section was nothing * but * talk . and tears . i 've never encountered a joan who cried so much -- i was left wondering if that was why falconetti was cast , since she seems to have a decided talent for it . the endless weeping did n't actually seem in character for a girl who produces the sort of smart comebacks quoted in the script , and the director seemed to be wallowing in tormenting both star and audience . i was aware of my neighbours fidgeting . but it picks up , unsurprisingly , when it shifts into more natural silent territory and actually allows the characters to move . the sets appear to be cardboard in the most literal sense of the term -lrb- the painted-on are particularly obvious -rrb- , but i could n't tell if that was a deliberate gesture at modernism or simply the result of budgetary limitations ; it gave the whole thing a certain stage play air , but when we actually see the soldiers tormenting joan rather than watching characters mouth words for the camera , the style becomes more fluid . one technical device i found irritating was the repeated choice to film faces in , with their foreheads cut off at the eyebrows . this is a mannerism i associate with the misuse of widescreen -lrb- which seems to have inherent problems with the fact that humans , unlike landscapes , are n't actually constructed in a shape -rrb- , and the ` low-brow ' result annoys me just as much coming from 1927 as it does in 2004 . but that 's just a personal quirk ... more audience reaction as we got to the blood-letting : there were audible groans and , and i could n't help wondering how this was done ! presumably they did n't * really * stick a scalpel into someone 's artery , let alone miss falconetti 's ? i noticed that the whole thing was shot in tight close-up with no glimpse of joan 's face . the finale , on the other hand , was more than gruesome enough for anybody , and the contrast to the unmoving opening scenes is stark : dreyer seems to have gone into mode with full gore , writhing flames , etc. . perhaps the only common factor with the courtroom sequence is that it goes on and on : there was certainly no fidgeting at this point , or if there was i myself was too horrified and riveted to be aware of it . but even here there were some consciously arty moments to break the spell : the repeated cut-aways from the bound joan to birds were less than subtle , and i can see why the use of the ` pendulum shot ' did n't catch on ... however , it is certainly convincing , probably too much so to pass for a pg certificate in the modern world : the shots of the charred body slumping into the rising flames are particularly explicit . one is left with the impression of having seen someone burned to death . i do n't think i was impressed by the bits that i was probably intended to be impressed by , and i spent a lot of the trial being haunted by echoes of bernard shaw 's play `` st joan '' , written a few years before this film came out : presumably both authors were quoting from the same sources , although it was distracting to recognise the retorts of shaw 's combative peasant girl while simultaneously presented with a visual of dreyer 's tortured saint . on the other hand , i was n't nearly as bored as i might have expected to be . the experimental features either passed me by or were actively off-putting , but the film did n't lose my interest .		7		1
yes , this movie most definitely had a negative impact on my life as it made me very scared of going under the knife . in which case it makes this movie a very effective movie as well . also , it seems to be the first movie with the title of coma made in a rather long list of them here at the internet movie database . the movie is about a hospital where there is something amiss . seems a good number of the patients are going into comas after surgery and most of them are seemingly patients that are in relatively good health for the most part . one young lady doctor suspects something is wrong and she works to uncover the truth . you also have michael douglas who does not really believe her when she starts to find things out . all in all a rather good mystery thriller type movie written by the guy who did jurassic park and other science fiction type novels . it is entertaining for the most part , but it also has a few slow stretches of film as well . however , i can not deny that when i had a surgery years after i had seen this movie this movie came to mind when i was going under .		7		1
when apollo 13 , which , to me , is still the best movie about the space program ever , came out , tom hanks said something which is still instructive . he said the story was so good in of itself there was no need to go hollywood on it , and i wish director joe johnston had taken that to heart with this movie . i read the book this is based on , and like this movie , it 's best when it focuses on the science part . it 's careful and probing , and it does n't overwhelm you with jargon talk . and you get to see the many mistakes before the eventual triumph . but the rest of the movie falls a little short . the sentiment was there in the book too , but it was n't as blunt as it is here . there are too many cliches , and a few changes -lrb- like having the teacher being able to see the final rocket launch from her hospital bed ; in reality , if memory serves , she had already died -rrb- . i guess i liked this movie , i just was n't inspired by it like others were , and like apollo 13 inspired me .		7		1
i should say at the outset there are many , many things i love about ` forbidden planet ' and yes , i certainly consider it a ` classic ' science-fiction film for many reasons . but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion . no less an authority than leonard maltin says ` forbidden planet ' '' ... is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre . '' ambitious ? without a doubt . intelligent ? depends on what part of the film you 're talking about . it certainly was the most prestigious and science-fiction flick to that point . at a cost of nearly $ 2 million -lrb- this was 1956 , remember -rrb- , mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling , eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before , even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects . ` charming ' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies , yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here . even the dreaded ` monster from the id ' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the disney people , unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8 . when i see the various sets and take note of the art design , models , costumes , etc. , i am reminded of nothing so much as ` the wizard of oz , ' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects . so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless . ` forbidden planet ' is wonderful to look at . the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated , matte paintings of planets and space in the background , and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth . it 's a bit like watching the most stage play you 'd ever see . the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex , where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible . but then we get to the actors , darn it . the performances are almost uniformly awful , though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor , except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble . even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance , it 's lugubrious at times . a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander j.j. adams , and does n't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film . he seems to instinctively know , thirty years ahead of time , that his true forte ' lay in comedy , as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines . every forced reaction , whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation , looks right out of a high school play . anne francis , also very young , fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta , whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up . -lrb- alta morbius , now there 's a name for you . -rrb- unfortunately , even at this early age , anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in ` butterfield 8 . ' there is a good story here , buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates ' leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl holliman 's ` cookie , ' ship 's cook . -lrb- holliman turns in a horrendous performance too . i 'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school . -rrb- based on shakespeare 's ` the tempest , ' the story of a dead race , the krell , and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about ` forbidden planet , ' and for good reason . for a few minutes here and there , you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists ' conception of the krell underground complex . is it enough to make up for the rest of the film 's shortcomings ? you 'll have to decide that on your own . oh , and of course there 's robby the robot , every 1950 's ten-year-old 's idea of what a robot should look and talk like . he 's funny . in places . so , ` forbidden planet ' to me is a very , very mixed bag . it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and tv shows that followed , not least of which was ` star trek . ' but i would suggest that anyone who thinks it 's more than well-staged comic book sci-fi go back and watch it again .		7		1
this is the fourth in the mission impossible series and it reboots the concept , rivalling the first instalment , and is far better than missions two and three . the choice of brad bird as director was risky , inspired , and has paid off . bird 's credits are with tv series , and animation on television and the big screen , but he is best known for his work with the simpsons . that he handles the action so well is a pleasant surprise , the delight is the humour he brings to the film with simon pegg as benji dunn being given a full supporting role , and injecting a comic element which the story considerably . in several scenes he steals the glory from tom cruise , and this enhanced role will surely be an essential ingredient in the next film . he plays dunn as a youthful q in the james bond series but more dynamically than simply as a techno-geek . hollywood 's desire to penetrate emerging markets is much in evidence here . a substantial chunk of the film is set in moscow , russia is not the bad guy -lrb- nor is the united states the good guy per se -rrb- and there are enough russian sub-titles to facilitate a russian language version with english subtitles . almost as much screen time is devoted to mumbai too where the film reaches its climax in a shameless attempt to woo russian and indian audiences . particular credit should also be given to the role of women in this film . paula patton , as jane carter proved playing opposite denzil washington in `` deja vu '' that she was a very accomplished actress . here she has a wonderful role as kick-ass agent resolved to avenge the death of a colleague and honey trap . she looks absolutely gorgeous in a powder blue shift dress and jacket , but is deadly too when she kicks off her heels to get down to business . lea seydoux , fresh from her success in robin hood , has an equally satisfying role as sabine moreau , an icy cold assassin on the bad guys team . the set pieces are uniformly excellent , the opening break out from a russian prison is particularly well choreographed and staged . mid film tom cruise as ethan hunt takes stunts to new heights literally , with a human fly scene at the world 's tallest building , the burj khalifa in dubai and the film ends with two action sequences in india . the latter , although well played can not trump the dubai stunt , but then again there are a lot more people in india to watch the film than dubai ! a justified criticism is that the plot is pure james bond , the bad guys steal russian weapons codes to start a nuclear war with america putting america in the frame by setting up hunt and his team as fall guys . furthermore michael nyqvist 's role as chief villain kurt hendricks is utilitarian rather than character driven so we do n't get a convincing good v evil showdown , but the story itself works satisfyingly enough . curiously ving rhames briefly reprises his role luther for a couple of odd minutes at the end which add little to the story , perhaps more was left on the cutting room floor ? in summary a faithful , action-packed and buoyant return to form with a very welcome new comedic dimension to it . cruise 's maturity in giving simon pegg more space in the story , and a willingness to be prepared to act his age , rather than a screen twenty five , does him much credit . i also applaud the fact that the iconic theme tune remains unchanged and the message , should they choose to accept it , still self-destructs in five seconds . the standard for the next instalment has been set high !		7		1
i love the concept of this movie as over-complicated as it is . kutcher has ability to go back , as it were , and rewrite history . his focus is on beautiful neighbor smart , with whom he was as a child a in her sick dad 's kiddie porn scheme . there 's a few other wackos around -lrb- more than the ordinary quota for one middle class neighborhood -rrb- that make life interesting for young kutcher . twist is that each time kutcher goes back and tries to fix things , other effects from his playing with the past make things worse than they were before . i like kutcher in the role , smart is pretty in an intriguing way and otherwise up to the task , but there are some downsides . the movie has some extremely unpleasant scenes that i passed on , it runs too fast through certain segments , it is often -lrb- to say it mildly -rrb- very difficult to follow , and some times kutcher 's attempts to fix the past are like killing an ant with a flamethrower . but the eventual resolution of the problem , however flawed it may actually be , is satisfying and meaningful in the context of the movie and in its own way . if i could take out the really grim parts i 'd give it a qualified thumbs up .		7		1
loved the dialog , loved the acting , loved the look - hated the ending . what was that ? i 'd go so far as to say that i did n't like the film because of the ending . i did n't understand it - i did n't want to understand it . it ruined the experience for me . i much prefered `` the sixth sense '' though the film made less of an impact getting to the end , the finish packed such a wild punch that it left me with an awe that lingers still . i would take `` the sixth sense '' over american beauty as best film any day .		7		1
`` the mist '' is an enjoyable horror movie based on a story written by stephen king . the basic premise of the plot centers on a time dimension hole that the us army has opened up in an effort to gain access to alternate universal time dimensions . our core characters are stranded in a rural grocery store when the army 's experiment goes awry . i was personally impressed with the production values of this film . i know a lot of people have complained about the cgi and the twist ending , but i was totally fine with both . i just do n't know what audiences want from horror movie anymore . sometimes i think movie goers are happier with slap dash horror remakes being shoved down their throats . i mean these people crying about cgi and a twist ending , get a life . listen , the film was well made , that 's it . it 's not a great film by any means , but i got the feeling that both the corporate and artistic ends of this production really cared about making a quality horror film they could stand behind . true , there could have been more gore , more scares , and better monsters ; but i 'll take `` the mist '' over any recent horror remake in a heart-beat . i really ca n't think of any substantial faults with this production . if you like stephen king horror film adaptations , you will love this one . i like even the worst films based on king 's work , but `` the mist '' is far from the worst . in fact , it very well may be in the top five , but it will never beat kubrick 's `` shining '' . if you have n't seen this movie , ignore the negative reviews and go and watch it . if you 've seen this movie and do n't like it , go watch the remake of `` the hitcher '' .		7		1
yours , mine and ours has some fatal flaws that for most -lrb- especially critics -rrb- destroyed the film -lrb- although it 's made more than it 's fair share of profit . -rrb- the film is brutally predictable and not only that but is far from a new concept coming along on the heels and in front of the cheaper by the dozen series . the single only difference is double the children . unfortunately as cute as that sounds there is just too many cast members . there are so many children that only a small few of them ever get to show off their characters . the film still aims for the exact same comedy as cheaper by the dozen did ... physical comedy usually involving the fact that so many children are under the same roof . the only plot variation is that these kids are trying to break up their new found parents because they hate each other . dennis quaid is by the book navy admiral frank beardsley . quaid is always a terrific leading man and he can do action , drama , and also comedy including some very funny physical comedy and pulls it off flawlessly . he is in fact one of the highlights of this film and certainly brings the most ability to the cast . rene russo is free spirited and less regimented new wife helen north who brings her 10 kids -lrb- 6 adopted , 4 of her own -rrb- to the chaos . russo is a good actress with a lot of experience and she nails a lot of big roles opposite basically every leading man in hollywood but does n't necessarily make her great . her acting is a bit dry and over performed in this film . she borders on annoying and if i were quaid i would have ran for the hills ... high school sweetheart or not . the kids ... well the kids do well but there is so darn many of them that none of them ever get the opportunity to really stand out with perhaps the exception of sean faris who plays eldest son william who plays a strong character but looks too old to be doing the things he gets involved with and the young twins and bridger palmer who are adorable and the perfect trouble makers . again all the kids do a fine job but there is way too many parts to make any difference . the film beginning to end is complete chaos with a hint of a decent storyline but everything moves at such break neck speed . quaid and russo meet and marry in about thirty seconds and how much money would these guys actually need to support a family of twenty ?? plus housekeeper , pig , dog , hamster etc. . russo and quaid do have decent chemistry and quaid 's character is a good character and a good father and some of the cute moments are exactly that ... cute ... but not overly funny . little kids will probably like the chaotic kids running wild fun but for most adults it 'll get old quick . i will say as predictable and clearly mapped out as the film is the ending is still warm and fuzzy and will make you smile ... any good feel good family flick should do that . it 's not something you should avoid , it 's not as bad as critics say it is but it 's mostly just a cute little family flick . 7/10		7		1
in patriot games , the always reliable harrison ford stars as reluctant action hero jack ryan in phillip noyce 's adaptation of tom clancy 's patriot games . good suspenseful action sequences always entertain , though the climatic boat chase is n't as impressive as it should be because it was filmed at night . sean bean is convincing and suprisingly sympathetic as ira freedom fighter sean miller who lets his yearnings for revenge lead him astray from his cause . the talented james earl jones and richard harris are woefully underutilized though that 's understandable considering this film is primarily a confrontation between ford 's ryan and bean 's miller . solid if unspectacular , 7/10 .		7		1
good acting , big name actors , and a lot of tanks make this exciting to watch . the march song adds to the film . some dated scenes and effects , but overall a good picture . robert shaw shines in his performance . it will be on pbs again . 7/10		7		1
this is a great billy wilder film , made mid-stream in his career at the height of his movie making . wilder and edwin blum adapted the story for the screen from the tony award winning broadway play by former prisoners of war donald bevan and edmund trzcinski . josé ferrer won the tony as best director in the play from which harvey lembeck as harry shapiro and robert strauss as stosh reprise their stage roles in the film . also appearing in the movie is playwright edmund trzcinski as . william holden leads the cast in this movie for which he won best actor for the 1953 academy awards . stalag 17 received two other nominations fro wilder as best director and for strauss in supporting actor . rounding out the cast is director otto , don taylor , peter graves and neville brand . veteran cinematographer ernest laszlo photographed the film where much of the scenes are outdoors in the camp compound as opposed to the mostly interior set of the play . this is arguably holden 's finest film role in the comedy/drama about prisoners of war in world war ii germany that inspired the television comedy show hogan 's heroes . i have seen this many times over the years and would give this film a 9.0 on a scale of 10 and recommend it .		9		1
this is one of the best sci-fi action movies in the last 20 years . it this was one of bruce willis best action roles since die hard . gary oldman is a brilliant actor and truly excelled at being a bad guy . this was also the beginning of milla jovovich 's action movie career . even the supporting cast was fantastic even the over the top criss tucker . movie watches like a comic book on screen , it was written by luc besson which is the same guy who wrote femme nikita and point of no return . this movie is so good that you can watch it over and over again . the story is solid and moves at a good pace . the special effects are well done without being too over the top . and even though this dvd was made in 1998 sound brilliant . there is plenty of gun fighting and explosions ... and as a added bonus leeloo has some impressive fighting scenes . willis plays korbin dallas who is a taxi driver in the future who happens to be some retired special forces guy . he ends up giving a ride to leeloo and saving her from people who do not understand who she is . she is there to save the world .		9		1
the director of oldboy , chan-wook park has a bucketful of awards , and just added a couple of more with this vampire tale . with graphic bloody violence , disturbing images , strong sexual content , nudity and language , you can be sure that this vampire tale is not in the twilight vein . ok-bin kim , a former beauty queen with very little acting experience , uses her beautiful face to advantage as she turns into a lascivious bloodsucker who wreaks havoc on the family that has abused her when she gets a dose of `` bad blood '' from a vampire priest . she got a best actress award from the catalonian international film festival for her performance . it is not strictly a `` vampire '' film , but one of doubt , murder , retribution , repentance , and psychological horror . oh , what an ending . it is definitely one of the best of the year .		9		1
this sci-fi fantasy had a lot of ingredients to be great , a wonderful concept , luc besson who directed the brilliant leon : the professional and gary oldman who is one of the best underrated actors working today being just a few . the fifth element is a hugely imaginative and enjoyable film , with only chris tucker 's annoying character and performance and the occasional lack of flow in the plot being its sole drawbacks . i adored the concept and the story even with the lack of flow never failed to intrigue . the script and satire are fun and slick , the visuals are breathtaking and unusual especially the amazing big apple effects with honourable mention to the camp trip to the resort planet paradise and there are plenty of thrills and imagination in the atmosphere to be had . besson 's direction is excellent , eric serra 's music is atmospheric and jaunty and the characters are fun . as is the acting , bruce willis is charismatic , milla jovovich is beautiful and gary oldman is the personification of corruption . in conclusion , a great sci-fi fantasy . 9/10 bethany cox		9		1
i 'm a movie buff -- if i like one , i see it again . i 've seen this one three times . `` miracle '' has it all -- acting , plot , realism , fast-pace , and suspense . it 's an excellent sports movie representing the best of that genre . kurt russell plays herb brooks , the hockey coach who forged his amateur team of all-star prima donnas into a family . patricia clarkson is patty , his wife . she is excellent and an underrated actress . these guys became a family and outplayed the russians at their own game . because i 'm a special education teacher at the high school level , i look for films that exemplify courage , hard work , honesty , integrity and persistence to show to my students . `` miracle '' has all these qualities plus that indescribable something called passion . highly recommended .		9		1
in david o. russell 's the fighter , we are given a glimpse at the life of micky `` irish '' ward -lrb- mark wahlberg -rrb- and his climb into the world of boxing . micky , the brother of dicky eklund -lrb- christian bale -rrb- , a former boxer whose claim to fame being his knockdown of `` sugar '' ray leonard . dicky trains micky in their home town of lowell , massachusetts , under the management of their mother , alice ward -lrb- melissa leo -rrb- . micky is looking to get his fair shot at legitimate fighters , only his mother 's managing skills go so far , landing him in smaller matches , and sometimes getting out matched . micky 's window is closing . his brother dicky , whose life has gone nowhere since his bout with leonard , wanders off away from the gym , to one of lowell 's many crack houses . his love of boxing and family is only outweighed by his drug addiction . micky 's family matters outside the ring are killing him in the ring . he finds confidence in his new girlfriend , college drop-out charlene -lrb- amy adams -rrb- , a brazen , young vixen who is not willing to let micky squander his gifts in the ring for a family he ca n't rely on . this aptly named film is not just about boxing , let alone just about micky ward . it 's about fighting to survive , fighting for love , for honor , and family . this is a film about the bond between brothers , between mothers and sons , husbands and wives , boxers and trainers . there are so many levels and ways to look at this film . micky 's struggles to achieve in the ring , dicky 's struggles with drug addiction , the list goes on . one thing that is clearly evident here is the painstaking attention to detail that russell takes in creating the world that micky ward boxed in . filming at the very same gym micky trained at , using the same cameras and crews that hbo boxing used to film micky 's fights , and even casting one of micky 's trainers mickey o'keefe to play himself . it reminded me of gus van sant 's milk where van sant used many shots from the documentary the times of harvey milk and other television segments to recreate the feel and especially the look of harvey milk 's san francisco . russell takes it even further with dicky 's life and includes the hbo documentary made featuring dicky in the early 90s . -lrb- i wo n't give the title , but you can view it on -rrb- to back up this realism you need real , raw performances from the entire cast . for me , the success of the film lies on wahlberg , without his commitment to the physical component of micky 's character and also his personality , the film would fail . he is supported by an incredibly cast , all of which give oscar worthy performances , especially bale . bale 's transformation into a wandering , drug addicted delinquent is something to see . his uneasiness on camera fits his character so well . the two supporting females both surprised me from the start . i knew of leo from frozen river , an indie darling two years back garnering her an oscar nod . adams i had known from several films , including one of my favorites of two years back , doubt . they both take off the gloves and get real dirty for this one . leo looks like the poster child for 90s hairdos while adams thick , nasty accent comes straight from the north shore of mass . . watching the two go at it on screen is fantastic . they really hit their marks . at the end of the film we are shown a glimpse of the real micky ward and dicky eklund , following the shooting of the film . as if we needed more of a reason to love their performances , here we see exactly where wahlberg and bale drew their inspiration from . their acting is spot on , another tribute to their devotion to the film .		9		1
i think most of the people who 's seen alien 4 would be quite amazed if ever seeing `` la cité ... '' . as i 've been looking at jeunet & caro since their first works , alien 4 is not that bas after all as long as i 'm keeping an eye on the `` jeunet feeling '' to it . but `` la cité ... '' ... ah , my dear friends , i do n't master english enough -lrb- i 'm from belgium , hem ... -rrb- to write something fair to this incredible work . i 'm a kubrick fan , you know , as many of you probably are -lrb- i suppose so -rrb- , but jeunet & caro touched my heart so deeply with this film that it instantly became my favorite ever . beyond its near-perfect film making mastery and its unique baroque touch -lrb- ok , gilliam and welles are not far away . . -rrb- lies a poisonous treasure no other movie ever gave to me like this one did : viewing my child 's dreams and terrors right there on the screen ... thank you jeunet & caro		9		1
it would be absurd to dismiss `` parallel '' as a propaganda movie.at the time a whole lot of movies were like ? william wyler 's `` mrs '' -lrb- 1942 -rrb- , fritz lang 's `` man hunt '' -lrb- 1941 -rrb- and `` hangmen also die '' -lrb- 1943 -rrb- , alfred hitchcock 's `` foreign correspondent '' -lrb- 1940 -rrb- and `` lifeboat '' -lrb- 1943 -rrb- , frank 's `` mortal storm '' -lrb- 1940 -rrb- , howard hawks 's `` sergeant york '' -lrb- 1941 -rrb- in america , michael powell , but also alexander korda -lrb- `` that lady hamilton '' -lrb- 1941 -rrb- -rrb- in england , no to mention russia -lrb- sm eisenstein -rrb- or france -lrb- marcel 's `` entente '' -lrb- 1939 -rrb- -rrb- . to be precise , one should add that powell 's masterpiece '' a matter of life and death '' -lrb- 1946 -rrb- -lrb- stairway to heaven -rrb- was also a commissioned work `` to sweeten the relationship '' . when a movie brings something to heart and mind , it transcends propaganda and can become a work of the term to leni von riefenstahl 's `` triumph des willens '' . powell 's movie is absorbing , it literally grows on you : during the first fifteen minutes you say to yourself : `` another war movie '' but further acquaintance shows this : michael powell is an auteur , a pacifist , and he knows cinema can be a powerful tool because of its realist , it sometimes becomes some kind of fable road is thoroughly absent except for the beginning and the execution . the movie is full of extraordinary scenes : sir laurence olivier dying , clutching his rosary ; the german christian community - influenced by frank capra 's `` lost horizon '' -lrb- 1937 -rrb- but the atmosphere of which predates peter weir 's `` witness '' by forty long dialogue about democracy : here , powell puts a question over the notion of `` native country '' no less ; this recurrent picture of trough which epitomizes not only the daily bread but also the new values the children who escaped from crumbling europe can share ; the gigantic gathering of white and red men where a mounties man asks everybody to scrutinize his neighbor 's face , in order to find the enemies , a sequence to rival the best of hitchcock ; leslie howard , the educated man , who loves matisse , picasso and thomas mann , whose works he proudly keeps under his teepee ; the finale at niagara falls on the trainor how to find a pacifist , the movie completely avoids pathos and by a very mundane last line which billy wilder would not disown . a movie where the stars do the supporting cast job : sir laurence olivier only appears a dozen of minutes -lrb- love his `` , gentille '' tune -rrb- ; anyway , before he shaves , you hardly know him ; and ditto leslie howard , but his character is so endearing you 'll remember him even if it 's a ten - minute part . one ceaselessly rediscovers powell -lrb- not forgetting his first-class scenarist pressburger -rrb- and it 's only the of his works are crying to be propaganda means conveying a message of love , peace and understanding , you can call most of his movies so .		9		1
rewatched on tv sat night with wifey and grant . here 's my thoughts ... . . `` flying high '' is one of the original great comedies by the combination . essentially it 's a spoof of airplane movies , with some of the great one liners of all times . the story begins with ted -lrb- robert hays -rrb- chasing down airline stewardess elaine -lrb- julie hagerty -rrb- as she 's about to leave on a flight . ted decides to jump on the plane and convince elaine to try to rebuild their relationship . before long things start going horribly wrong on the flight when a stack of people , including pilots , get sick from the fish . soon the crew are looking for a pilot to land the plane and turn to ted , an ex-army pilot still recovering from the horrors of war . an outstanding comedic cast including leslie nielsen , peter graves , lloyd bridges , robert stack and even kareem abdul-jabbar . truly one of the great comedies of all-time that still holds up well today with it 's off-beat jokes and timeless catch phrases . must see comedy .		9		1
danny ocean 's -lrb- frank sinatra -rrb- army buddies along with himself plan to rob 5 las vegas casinos at one time by causing a power failure in the gambling city . the film is a good one , especially because it deals with the personal lives of sinatra and peter lawford . the latter plays a rich guy , under the thumb of his constantly doting mother . she is extremely wealthy and constantly remarrying . her latest beau , duke santos , is well played by cesar romero . angie dickinson co-stars as the former wife of danny , who still has feelings for the guy . besides being in the film , sammy davis , jr. sings the title song and dean martin does some crooning as well . the ending shall definitely burn you ! this is far better than the george clooney remake many years later .		9		1
the first time i saw `` a walk to remember '' i was blown away , but this second viewing helped me analyze each element of the film separately . i 'm not talking about a deep analysis , but about an analysis this movie deserves , because it appears as a romantic teen drama , but it is truly a great film ; and it deserves a great film 's analysis . the story of `` a walk to remember '' is about a popular high school boy -lrb- landon -rrb- who hangs out with a popular group and a high school girl -lrb- jamie -rrb- who hangs out with the telescope and stars , the bible -lrb- her father is a reverend played by peter coyote -rrb- and religion and the retarded students she tutors for fun . they are portrayed by shane west and mandy moore , and the plot line says they are `` thrown together '' so make a guess . sounds familiar ? well , it 's not : it 's different ; just about every other thing in the movie . when landon screws up and gets to be in the high school play , he ends up asking jamie help with the lines . `` alright '' , she says . `` but with one condition : promise me you wo n't fall in love with me '' . `` that wo n't be a problem '' , landon replies . what happens after jamie 's warning is nothing else than a story of true love courtesy of nicholas sparks ; author of the book the movie is based on and author of another true love story : `` the notebook '' . it was the job of karen to turn that love into a screenplay , and she did her work very well , considering the little number of screenplays she had written before . it is 's screenplay -lrb- with the main help of sparks ' novel -rrb- what makes this movie so different ; because the reactions of the characters in the crucial moments , which should be predictable , are not . the simple words we are expecting them to say are changed by other words as simple that become surprising . this fact is supported by the labor of the cast ... a labor of . shane west , a now grown up actor i admire very much and who has divided his career between the series `` once and again '' , the bad guy in `` get over it '' and a better act than sean connery in `` the league of extraordinary gentlemen '' ; achieves here what 's still the best performance of his life . his sarcastic commentaries , his anger and his happiness are flawless . mandy moore 's performance is just remarkable , and mostly inspiring considering her situation -lrb- her first and in my opinion her best lead role of her career -rrb- . she transmits sweetness and tenderness in her voice that when she sings it does n't even seem out of place . al thompson 's and clayne crawford 's parts as landon 's best friend are very solid and more credible than most of their `` characters '' in other films . but what i had n't appreciated was peter coyote 's portrayal . his character seemed so typical and obvious the first time i saw the film that i did n't pay attention to him . this time , i carefully watched his manners . his lines are so carefully spoken , so well appreciated ; and his looks ... his looks are so honest that you care about his worries . adam shankman , a choreographer and probably not the best option for directing the film ; astounds with his measured view of the strong events the story tells and leaves behind the regular `` the wedding planner '' . in one scene , during the high school play , his camera slowly observes each of the main characters in the audience to contrast what 's happening onstage ... daryl hannah is there , and even david lee smith 's short appearance becomes noticeable . their expressions say a lot for a romantic teen drama ; but much less for a great film .		9		1
zelig is simply a jaw-dropping sight and sound as a film ; hilarious ... out loud . the funny premise is polished to some astonishing level of trickery with editing and matte effects seamlessly blending real 20s with recreated 20s adding allen and farrow and dialog and interviews that will have you recalling and roaring with laughter for days . i had not seen it since 1983 and now in 2008 to be reminded how stunning and hilarious this creation is , well , i am just delighted to be back on the wavelength of this genuinely brilliant hoax documentary . now i can see how forrest gump came about , given that it is a similar ` historic ' premise using real footage of events and eras mixed with the lead character . but zelig is another perfection altogether ; if you know your 20s , silent films , the imagery , the early sound newsreels and all those silly songs , then zelig is a superlative treat . it even features mae singing a new betty boop song and for that alone i cheer this almost perfect film . what a delight . if you also get to see the early peter jackson hoax documentary forgotten silver or stanley donen 's movie movie you will be equally rewarded .		9		1
sean penn plays sam bicke who decides to kill president nixon in `` the assassination of richard nixon , '' a 2004 film brilliantly directed by niels muller , who co-wrote the excellent script with kevin kennedy . the film is actually based on a true story and stars sean penn , naomi watts and don cheadle . the story begins with sam bicke -lrb- penn -rrb- writing a letter to leonard bernstein which is read throughout the film . sam bicke is a man separated from his wife -lrb- watts -rrb- and two daughters but hoping for a reconciliation . at the beginning of the film , we know he worked once for his successful brother but now is working as a furniture salesman for a blowhard -lrb- jack thompson -rrb- who is constantly lecturing him , playing mind games with him , and handing him books by dale carnegie while his son -lrb- brad henke -rrb- reports everything sam does to his father . sam applies for an loan in the hopes of going into the tire business with a friend -lrb- cheadle -rrb- , similar to what his brother does . it 's clear sam 's life is going nowhere , but he retains some illusions ; we watch him unravel as he realizes what the audience has known all along . his wife is soon to be his ex-wife and wants nothing to do with him , and she 's seeing somebody else ; his job is n't long for this world ; and he 's not going to get the loan . he feels more and more isolated and even tries to join the black panthers at one point . finally he has the psychotic break that 's been coming for the whole film . though sam does terrible things , his story is so heartbreaking that it 's impossible to hate him . in fact , i found myself loathing his wife for her uncaring and unfeeling attitude , though conversely , i understood his brother 's rage . and his boss - only a desperate man would have put up with him for five minutes . it seems like sam is just someone who has fallen through society 's cracks , someone no one cares about , no one realizes or cares is damaged and needs help . unfortunately , there are probably millions of sam bickes in this world . he can live only in his own twisted mind , which twists further and further until it explodes . there is n't any question that sean penn is one of our greatest american actors . it 's fine for people to praise johnny depp , who is fantastic and more versatile , but no one can do this kind of heavy drama like penn can . his characterization is staggering : heartfelt , full of suppressed rage and real agony , desperation and alienation . it is another in his resume of stunning portrayals . there 's nothing subtle about penn 's gifts - when he was a kid on broadway in a flop play , heartland , it was obvious to audiences that he was going to be a star . as for the rest of the cast , watts is brilliant and unrecognizable as bicke 's estranged wife , and jack thompson is utterly believable as his boss . this is one of those movies that you 'll see and wo n't be able to get out of your head . it breaks your heart .		9		1
talking toys ! talking bugs ! talking monsters ! talking fish ! now , talking cars ? oh , my ! a talking race car movie ! how awesome is that ? the story of racing rookie lightning mcqueen thinks his career is a walk in the park , when he suddenly ends up in a town called radiator springs and meets some particular faces , and learns that there is more to life than gold medals . now , this is something i call completely inspirational . i thought `` cars '' was an excellent movie from pixar , and another movie that uses fiction to teach real-life lessons . and the voice talents of owen wilson , paul newman , bonnie hunt , michael keaton , larry the cable guy , and an appearance by racing star richard petty was all quite impressive . i thought the story was well true to life , it 's another pixar flick with a big heart , and it was actually pretty funny . i felt that the movie really taught that everything else in life is more important than winning a lot of races . i love the animation , the heart , the characters , and all of those racing scenes . this movie just makes you want to go out there and race to glory . wow , what a funny pun ! now , it 's time to rev up the engines and head back home ! `` cars '' , in my review , `` hilariously awesome , and has a big heart '' .		9		1
this harry potter movie is really well done . instead of action , this movie focuses more on the drama and romance , definitely the romance . because there is limited action , the filmmakers had to add additional scenes which everyone say it did n't happen in the novel -lrb- true , it did n't -rrb- . also , the movie tended to be a little on the boring side . this time around , the gang enters the sixth year at hogwarts with dark times lurking . basically this year , harry learns the secrets of voldemort 's past with dumbledore . also romance begins to bloom between harry , ron , hermione , and ginny . this is probably the darkest harry potter movie yet . obviously , the final two are going to be darker . i thought the score by hooper is much better here . even though i really liked this film , i thought this may be the weakest of all of the hp movies . i rate this film 9/10 .		9		1
one of my top 10 favourite films , i 've seen this more times than i can remember , from very young to very medium now -- it 's long been a favourite comfort film for me . from the witty sometimes moving dialogue to the piles of books in frank 's sitting room to the camera obscura and heaven is just like milton keynes to the teardrop laden rose and the ethereal escalator being stopped by love , i feel i know it backwards . an amazing achievement and a dazzling work of art . raf pilot and poet david niven gets shot down in flames , should die but does n't , because he was apparently missed by heavenly conductor 71 marius goring . his case has to go to trial up above because in the disputed extra 20 hours he fell in love with american kim hunter , a rather lovely mass from boston . and far more with far more heavier points to get over . there 's some fantastic camera work from jack cardiff who provided so many money shots : close-ups of tearful hunter at the beginning `` you 're life and i 'm leaving you '' and the end -lrb- `` we won '' -rrb- ; the long shot of the busy rehearsal hall with the girl and her legs ; the frozen ping pong game between hunter and roger livesey ; the entire brave shoo shoo baby sequence ; the iconic pic of niven and hunter in a clinch after clinching victory ; the golden staircase to the stars etc. . the inside of niven 's closing eyelid is perhaps best forgotten ! if they 'd had enough film stock a technicolor heaven would 've looked just as marvellous . like all the very best things in art it has a few faults - would that life , death and love were this simple - and time and technology has certainly taken its usual toll , but to me it 's almost faultless . and i put a spoiler warning on this because i was petrified my comments might make sense to the unwary ! i really ca n't praise this film highly enough it 's such a cinematic wonder ; to all those involved gone before , rip - i hope my allotted span is not up just yet and i will be able to watch it again many more times .		9		1
director robert altman took up this film , and one might question why an auteur who 's rep is for more intense and cutting work -lrb- m * a * s * h , the player and short cuts among them -rrb- would want to helm a film story that is as relaxed and pleasantly humored as cookie 's fortune . this ensemble piece -lrb- altman seems lost without a large cast to work with -rrb- , centers around the duvall family of holly springs , mississippi , mostly with sisters camille -lrb- hyperventilating glenn close -rrb- and cora -lrb- julianne moore , fantastic as uncharacteristically dull and child-like here -rrb- and their aunt , the cookie in the title -lrb- played with nutty joy by veteran actor patricia neal -rrb- . when cookie kills herself in the belief she 'll reunite with her husband , camille decides that rather than to shame the family name -- she believes only `` crazy '' people commit suicide -- she 'll make the suicide look like a homicide . when cookie 's longtime friend , a good-natured local sort -lrb- charles dutton , great actor with a great story himself -rrb- is implicated somehow , the only person in the small , sleepy town that seems to be okay with this situation , or even vaguely kid herself to believe it is camille . the sub-story of the budding between an who is a sheriff 's deputy -lrb- chris o'donnell -rrb- and the black sheep of the duvall family -lrb- liv tyler -rrb- seems to be almost vestigial and lacking much purpose here . supporting turns by ned beatty -lrb- as a skeptical sheriff who is friends with dutton 's character -rrb- , matt malloy , lyle lovett and are used to prop up the story to adequacy . anne rapp 's story is given a slow , sweet , eccentric pace , which seems perfect for the part of america it 's set in . i saw this no fewer than three times on video , after having missed it in theatrical release -lrb- which was very short -rrb- and found myself charmed by it every time . if you like your movies character-centered and just a wee bit strange , i think you 'll dig this one .		9		1
`` the sixth sense '' was a sharp , haunting thriller that was almost painful to watch . the main thing that distracted me from this movie was a constant feeling of pity for the main character in the story , a little boy . not only was the kid living in constant terror , but nobody believed him , and it looked like he would be locked up in a mental ward . focusing on the constant pain the boy was in was to me a major distraction , causing me to lose track of a lot of subtle details i otherwise would have noticed . i did n't find the movie terribly entertaining . however , like most others , i was * completely * blindsided by the surprise ending - i did n't see it coming at all , and when it comes it 's a real shock . the audience in the theater i saw the movie in let out a loud , collective gasp of exhaustion and fascination when the end credits started to roll , as if they had been holding their breath for two hours . this is a movie i would like to see again , now that i know how it ends . 9/10 .		9		1
i think everybody loves a good revenge film as much as the next . they 're not hard to get right . but with that being said hollywood put these movies on ground rules of sorts that are in every revenge movie -lrb- stuff like the hero is always good , the killer is always evil , ends off with the hero walking away in the sunset -rrb- of which this movie avoids . the plot of this movie is that a secret agent 's wife is the latest victim of a serial killer . he goes out with intentions of revenge , in the process becoming just as bad as the serial killer that he himself is pursuing . after that the killer reveals that his wife was pregnant at the time -lrb- and her last words -rrb- and kills her family . after that the secret agent lays out a trap to make his family inadvertently kill him . in this movie unlike other revenge movies , clearly from my plot description nobody in this movie walks away happy . the secret agent has nothing , the killer 's family would obviously be grieving at the fact that they inadvertently killed him . all other central characters -lrb- or close to central -rrb- have died by that point . the only thing i did n't like about it -lrb- and the only thing stopping me from giving it a 10/10 -rrb- was that you really do have no character to root for halfway through the movie -lrb- thankfully it gets fixed -rrb- that and those scenes were a little . so get this movie if you want a movie that is truly refreshing in genre and gripping .		9		1
i went in with low expectations , which might of helped , but i ca n't remember the last time i saw a better film than this in the past 2 years or so . this is a film in the science fiction category , but it 's more of a drama set in the future . ill write this critique assuming the reader already knows what the film is about so ill speak of it 's positives and negatives . the rare but not unique directing in this film is very much ala kubrick , and ala spielberg . both used long takes , kubrick mastered the tracking take and spielberg the long take with extras and chaos in background . cuaron ' does a great job at doing this in 3 particular scenes and especially at the end with a 9 minute single take . the effect achieved with this method is ultra realistic , evoking a situational feeling which puts the viewer in the main character 's shoes . the acting was superb , throughout the entire cast , my favorite was caine 's character jasper . i hope he snags up an oscar just for some face time , he deserves it . i also wanted to elaborate on he atmosphere here . managment of extras in this film was fantastic . people tend to forget about that aspect of directing . the setting is a gothic future london and they really made it look depressing . i have n't seen such brilliance since kubrick 's full metal jacket . com has more action and epic-like war scenes that will give you flash backs of saving private ryan . now some of the flaws in this film include shallow writing . it 's a drama at heart . little philosophy about god , religion and science . few scenes mention or explain such topics , but the film does n't really concentrate on what caused infertility or why the world collapsed and how . you will see the hate bush signs and some violent muslims parading with guns . but it 's all in the background , and your journey is the main attraction in this film . the moral is about one thing . everyone has a purpose , whether you contribute to chance , or to the will of nature .		9		1
'' `` o wad some power the gift tae gie us , to see as see us ! '' -- robert burns beginning as a blue speck in the far distant horizon , in four years a new planet resembling earth has moved into our solar system , creating a hovering phantom-like globe in the sky that puzzles scientists and laymen alike , but brings a feeling of wonder to the night sky . winner of the alfred p. sloan feature film and the jury prize at the sundance film festival , mike cahill 's low-budget film , another earth , is a quietly beautiful meditation on guilt , redemption , and second chances . though it has some implausible elements , it is so skillfully written and performed that these elements seem irrelevant . cahill demonstrates that science fiction movies do not have to have blaring music , unending frenzy , cgi effects , or ugly and violent monsters to successfully capture our imagination . the premise of the film is that the new planet is an exact mirror of the earth , containing a duplicate version of ourselves who mirror our earthly circumstances . cahill 's main focus , however , is not the new planet but the attachment between two damaged individuals who begin to bring each other back to life after a devastating incident that forever scarred their lives . as the film opens , rhoda williams -lrb- brit marling -rrb- , a bright 17-year old , unsteady after a night of celebrating her acceptance into mit , drives her car through a red light , putting composer john burroughs -lrb- william mapother -rrb- in a coma and killing his pregnant wife and their young son . the film then jumps ahead four years when the still guilt-ridden and morose rhoda is released from prison and tries to set her life in order , moving back with her parents kim -lrb- jordan baker -rrb- and robert -lrb- flint beverage -rrb- , and her brother jeff -lrb- robin taylor -rrb- . though she had planned on studying astrophysics , the only job she can now get is working as a high school janitor , a job where she keeps to herself without much interaction with others . when she sees john placing a toy robot at the site of the accident , on a whim she goes to his house pretending to be a maid offering a free trial for a cleaning service oddly called `` maid in heaven . '' in the back of her mind , however , is finding a way to release her inner torment . fascinated with this sullen but obviously highly intelligent woman , john takes her up on her offer and asks her to come back each week to clean his house . at first uncommunicative both verbally and emotionally , the two alienated people slowly begin opening up to each other a little bit more each week . though rhoda eventually plans to tell john that she was responsible for the accident that killed his family , their visits seem to bring them to a new awakening of what is possible in their life , and she repeatedly postpones her confession . after listening to tv broadcasts talking constantly about the possibility that your identical twin on earth 2 might be a happier and more satisfied version of you , rhoda enters a contest to become the first voyager to visit the other earth . astonishingly , she wins first prize after a heart rendering essay describing the reasons she wants to go . at first , pleading with her not to go through with it , john 's attitude is changed drastically after she reveals her complicity in the fatal accident , a scene that leads to a startling and unpredictable conclusion . supported by the ethereal sounds of the group `` fall on your sword , '' another earth engenders powerful performances that deserve recognition at awards time . marling , who also co-wrote the film , gives an intense and moving performance that brings her character fully to life . though the film misses an important teachable moment near the end , it is a quietly powerful work of art that suggests that truth lays more in inner than in outer space , and that the biggest world to conquer is the one that is right before our eyes . as author marcel proust put it , `` the real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes .

i 've seen this movie four times now and waited before writing a review , waited to see if my first spell-bound viewing could be matched by the others that would follow . and an overwhelming yes is the answer . it actually gets deeper with each viewing even with knowing that the cast were given the outline of the characters and told to develop their own dialogue . in fact brenda blethyn , who plays cynthia , the mother , was not even aware that hortense , played by marianne jean-baptiste , was black until she meets her for the first time in a crucial scene . timothy spall , playing maurice , the is incredible , what he can portray just with his eyes is breathtaking . i love the layering of the story , the characterizations so unexpected . such as the child abandoned at birth and put out for adoption being the most centred and focused of everyone . the drunken ex-owner of the business that maurice bought bringing maurice to a place of awareness that it could be him wandering around drunkenly , speaking of his past achievements . the flashes of mini-plots portrayed by the subjects of maurice 's photographic settings . the heart-breaking scene where maurice 's snobby wife reveals her secrets . the slowly developing warmth and comfort between cynthia and on . this is a fabulous movie , worth seeing over and over to `` get '' it all . and even then . the secret of hortense 's father is never revealed , just an `` unknown '' marked on the birth certificate , which leaves us to ponder on the fact she was probably raped at fifteen . she states she deliberately never saw the baby that was the result . you can literally feel her growing joy in hortense and how beautiful a person she is . one scene earlier on has cynthia telling hortense how more like her she is than her other -lrb- white -rrb- daughter . remarkable . 9 out of 10 . would that we had a mike leigh at this side of the world to bring us such treasures !!		9		1
by now the harry potter series wo n't need any explanation . most people that will be seeing this film will have seen the films and/or read the books after all . this fifth part is a huge part . about 1000 pages , the largest part so far . filmwise this means a lot of information needs to be brought to the screen or trimmed away far enough that it disappears without too much consequence . so far the series fared rather well on that . the first three do a more or less straight conversion . harry potter 4 was missing a lot of data that was in the book but still worked out well enough . for me , part 5 misses more data than 4 did , but works out better nonetheless . i think this is a great film . it 's fast , action packed , played out well enough . i also think it works better for people who have read the book than for people that have n't . some things do n't connect very well without the story backing it . new characters like luna lovegood were typecast brilliantly which added to the film in a great way . used effects were great , atmosphere was chilling , musical choice was fitting . all in all , another great addition to the series . looking forward to the next part . 9 out of 10 wizards bewitched		9		1
it 's hard to comment on this title without giving away major plot , the gist of it is this , a man has no short term memory due to an assault during which his wife is raped and does n't no who did it or why , but he is driven to find out and bring the perpetrator to since he has no short term memory he has to use some clever methods just to get through the day , as he tries to piece together what see events unfold from his point of pierce plays the main character with carrie-anne moss and joe pantoliano in strong supporting performances.the time line is a bit hard to follow so you really have to pay attention , and you may have to view the film more than once , but it 's well worth it.for me , memento is a 9/10		9		1
after `` saving private ryan '' and `` apocalypse now '' i never thought that another filmmaker would make a war movie that managed to get to their feets ... kathryn bigelow succeeded in a fantastic way . `` the hurt locker '' can be one of the best war movies of all time , explore and show 's the iraq war in a way never seen before , getting to be quite original in many details . one of the most positive and original points on the film is that it dose n't focus attention on shootings sequences as other war films do , but explores the view of the soldiers , as they see and feel the war , putting the public on their places . who sees the war on television or news , just see unnecessary killing and massacre between peoples and nations , yeah it is true but then people say that the soldiers are murderers . the film manages to explore this sense from the perspective of the soldiers , they are only there to follow rules , their job is being there , the soldiers only have each other and fight to protect the man on their side , we see that they count the days they spend in combat to return home soon which seems impossible . mark boal gets conveying this with a superb screenplay , shows reality in an impressive way . not only is the screenplay is very real but also the impressive visual details that the film delivers . another plus point in the film are the visual effects , giving the film an visual magnitude , impressive in every passing moment , and with the direction of kathryn bigelow everything is just amazing . the cast could not have been better for the story of these soldiers . jeremy renner gives a fantastic performance in every detail as sergeant first class william james ; anthony mackie as sergeant jt sanborn and more ; brian geraghty ; guy pearce and ralph fiennes . from start to finish , `` the hurt locker '' gives an impressive view of the war in iraq , stuffed maintenance ; emotion ; action and an impressive visual spectacle , one of the best war movies ever made .		9		1
the initial critical verdict of vertigo was that it was not one of alfred hitchcock 's better films . time has turned it into his most analyzed and revisited movie and , in the eyes of many , his masterpiece . i still do n't subscribe to the opinion that this is hitchcock 's greatest film -lrb- give me the thirty nine steps , foreign correspondent or north by northwest -rrb- but it is certainly a wonderfully absorbing mystery , and the original indifference that greeted the film from critics and audiences was totally unjust . it takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate what hitchcock is up to in this movie - it is a sophisticated and multi-layered film that grows in stature the more times you view it . san francisco cop john `` scottie '' ferguson -lrb- james stewart -rrb- has a hair-raising escapade on a rooftop while chasing a robber . thereafter , he develops vertigo -lrb- a fear of heights -rrb- and retires from the force . some while later scottie is contacted by his old friend gavin elster -lrb- tom helmore -rrb- who wants to hire him for a little unofficial private detective work . elster is worried by his wife 's increasingly outlandish behaviour - she seems to go into a dreamy state of mind and wanders off for hours on end without any explanation as to where she has been . scottie 's job is to tail her and learn where she goes . the mystery thickens when scotties starts following madeline elster -lrb- kim novak -rrb- ... the more he learns about her and her wanderings , the more it seems that she is possessed by the spirit of her long-deceased ancestor carlotta valdes . eventually scottie saves madeline when she tries to drown herself in san francisco bay , and soon after they fall in love . but just as scottie begins to make headway into her psychological problems , she kills herself by leaping from a bell tower . scottie is left in a state of mental shock but later , following his release from hospital , he bumps into a woman named judy -lrb- novak again -rrb- who is the exact double of madeline ... hitchcock generates a stunning air of mystery with vertigo , coaxing brilliant performances from stewart and novak and using the location of san francisco as almost a third leading `` character '' in his story . stewart 's obsession with novak , and his descent into madness as he grieves over his inability to protect her , is brilliantly portrayed . as ever - in fact , more so than ever - hitchcock keeps the audience off-balance with his disorientating camera work , ingenious plotting and atmospheric use of colour . bernard herrmann contributes a haunting score -lrb- his fourth for hitchcock -rrb- that heightens the passion and suspense even further . the solution when it comes is extremely clever , and proves -lrb- as if proof is needed -rrb- that hitchcock has a masterful touch when it comes to clever plot twists . the film 's chief drawbacks , for me , are the excessively studied pacing in the first half , and the somewhat abrupt ending . on the whole , though , this is a superb film which is always a pleasure to come back to .		9		1
` manhattan ' looks beautiful in black and white . it is definitely woody allen 's best . two years after ` annie hall ' we have woody allen and diane keaton together again . allen plays isaac who is dating the 17-year old tracy -lrb- mariel hemingway -rrb- . he has a friend , the married yale -lrb- michael murphy -rrb- , who is having an affair with mary -lrb- diane keaton -rrb- . isaac falls in love with mary and stops seeing tracy to start things with mary . in a sub-plot we have the ex-wife of isaac publishing a book about their sex-life . now she is living with a woman . the ex-wife jill is played by meryl streep . her appearances are short and not very often but she is more than great in her scenes . ` manhattan ' is even better than the great ` annie hall ' . the black and white cinematograpy , done with a good reason , gives a little extra to the movie . like i said streep is terrific and so are allen , keaton and especially hemingway -lrb- she was nominated for an oscar -rrb- . the monologues allen had in ` annie hall ' are still present , smart , interesting and funny . a great story , very intelligent , of course written -lrb- and directed -rrb- by woody allen himself .		9		1
there 's literally no distinction at imdb.com between the two . so technically i ca n't tell what the true rating is for the new one . highlander 2 introduced me to the series . i still like h2 . some hate the movie . but i ca n't tell whether it 's because of the original cut or the new one . -lrb- spoilers ?? -rrb- i love the entire movie series . -lrb- never cared for the tv show stuff -rrb- . mostly love the actress who plays heather . but she does n't do movies much . but i also like chris . who probably does movie more for money than most actors . -lrb- why would anyone do druids ?? -rrb- but it was his highlander movies that he was best at . h2 is n't for true fans of the first movie . -lrb- whats a true fan . do n't look at me . more like obsessed fans . but i 'm getting derogatory there -rrb- i love the storyline . so keep giving me conner . this movie gives hope to those mourning the loss of conner in the odd fourth movie . this movie also leaves an opening for sean connery to return . but until imdb gives a distinction between cuts , i ca n't give a review i want . so go have your pick . the quickening : 2/10 quality : 5/10 entertainment : 5/10 replayable : 1/10 renegade version : 9/10 quality : 7/10 entertainment : 10/10 replayable : 8/10		9		1
this 1984 horror-flick is without no question a film that will frighten you . `` a nightmare on elm street '' is a fantasy of terror , as director wes craven shows how a badly burned bogyman can kill and destroy a group of teens thru their dreams . when first seeing this as a small kid the burned face of freddy would frighten me as when i would lay down at night you would think of his face , and not want to fall asleep ! `` elm street '' has the gore , blood , and evil but unlike some horror films elm street 's main theme is psychological . as one should know it 's the fears of the mind that are the worst the things you imagine , that hurt you the most in the end . with this group of friends it is the psychology of their nightmares that kills the mind and brings death upon them . watching this can get into your mind at a young age to be frightened , but as i grew older this film still stayed scary to me , but i learned to look at the realism and not be frightened . in my opinion wes craven made this film to show a connection and maybe bring some attention to people about the issue of serial murders , and to remind them that we do n't live in a good world . also remember during this films release in 1984 , the us was dealing with unsolved cases all over the 50 states . craven knew an ugly face , a dirty hat and razor gloves would help start the slasher genre , and yes he did put a psychological fear in the public , with this slasher classic .		9		1
i do n't think i had ever been affected by a film as much as i was the first time i saw this one . it can be seen as a film full of senseless violence , or it can be seen as a statement on the resolve of humankind , and the reactions of humans when placed in an inescapable , nightmarish situation . could you kill your best friend ? some of the kids in this movie ca n't act , and that 's quite obvious , even for someone watching it in subtitles . the players who can act , however , really can act . as usual , takeshi kitano plays a very understated character , but with three dimensions . he is superb as the teacher who introduces the class to battle royale . some scenes in this film are ridiculous , to such an extent that you might laugh out loud , when you should n't . some might call this a black comedy . i think it 's a terrific horror story , essentially , as well as a critique on human nature . this is a terrific film , and a personal favourite of mine . the only person i know who does n't like this film is my father , who thought it was just violence for the sake of violence . he likes steel magnolias , though , so his opinion is certainly questionable , to say the least . a word of warning : if you 're going to get this movie , get the original cut , and not the special edition . the se of battle royale is spoilt by a number of factors . for one , there was no need to add new scenes , like the basketball match . i felt these extras additions detracted from the overall dark feel of the piece , and i consider them to be completely unnecessary . they also make the film drag slightly . as well as this , there is the fact that the blue filter used in the original cut of the film has been removed in the special edition , making the whole film appear more like a made-for-tv movie rather than a cinematic masterpiece .		9		1
in the 70 's , america 's patriotism was at an all time low due to events of watergate and several other scandals . no one believed in the government . then `` rocky '' came along , and gave the people someone to look up to . rocky balboa may be a fictional character , and the story may be fictional as well , but it was something everyone can relate to and enjoy . `` rocky '' is a very low-budget , quickly made movie . the script was written by the unknown -lrb- at the time -rrb- sylvester stallone . it was filmed on approx . $ 20,000 , shot in about a month , and often on the first takes . and the result was amazing ! this was a story so compelling , so down-to-earth , so true-to-life , there was no way you could not enjoy it . all of this , throw in great performances by sylvester stallone , talia shire , burt young , carl weathers , and burgess meredith , and you have one of the greatest films that arise feelings of to ever hit the big screen . rocky is truly one for the ages . if you have not seen it yet , what are you waiting for ?!?!?		9		1
¨ there is a lot of things that a man can change his mind about , but never his passion ¨ el secreto de sus ojos , which translated means the secret in their eyes , is an argentinean film that has recently been nominated for an oscar in the best foreign movie category . juan jose campanella -lrb- who also directed luna de avellaneda and el hijo de la novia , along with many law and order and house md television episodes -rrb- directs this thriller which has been a box office hit in argentina . it has also received a lot of critical acclaim because of the way the story is told in non-linear form and it also has some great performances from the entire cast ; but what makes this movie so much better is the clever ending because in order for a thriller to work you need to have a decent ending and this movie has a great one . the entire build up to the finale is just sensational and the movie does n't drag for one minute during the entire two hours the movie lasts . it mixes romance with action and drama with suspense and balances them all very well . there is one specific action scene in a soccer stadium where a chase takes place that is just breathtaking . i have n't seen an argentinean movie so good since nueve reinas -lrb- nine queens -rrb- . this movie is very clever and i recommend you seeing it in its original language -lrb- spanish -rrb- because the performances are so good and the dialogues are so real -lrb- if you 've been to argentina you know most of the conversations take place in the exact same manner , it just has a very authentic feel to it -rrb- . the movie takes place in 1999 and we are introduced to benjamin esposito , played by the very famous argentinean actor ricardo darin -lrb- nueve reinas , el hijo de la novia , and el aura -rrb- . he is a retired federal justice agent who is trying to write a novel during his free time about a case that happened 25 years ago and that dramatically changed his life . he decides to visit his ex coworker irene , played by soledad villamil -lrb- no sos vos , soy yo -rrb- and tells her about his plans . both of them get together and discuss about the morales case which occurred in 1974 . the movie is non linear because while benjamin writes the story we are transported to the past and we experience it while it is actually happening . he is working at the federal agency and irene has just been introduced to them as the new chief of the department . his co worker and best friend is pablo sandoval , played by the extremely funny guillermo francella -lrb- rudo y cursi -rrb- . one of the first cases they have to take with irene as their boss is a difficult one in which a young woman has been brutally raped and murdered at her home . they inform the newly widowed husband , ricardo morales played by pablo rago , about the terrible news . he is devastated and benjamin is so stunned about the way that this man loved his wife -lrb- he later tells irene that he has never seen so much love through the eyes of someone -rrb- that he promises to help him catch the killer . after viewing some photographs of the victim 's past he finds a suspect , a childhood friend of hers named isidro gomez , played by javier godino -lrb- deception and kisses for everyone -rrb- . the chase begins and the movie develops from this point on jumping from 1974 to 1999 as benjamin is writing the novel and trying to close a case that has been left open for more than 25 years . el secreto de sus ojos is a great movie which will have you at the edge of your seat at some moments and laughing your heart out at others . it also has some romance due to the interrupted love between benjamin and irene , so it is a movie that everyone can enjoy . it is a great story and juan jose campanella does a great job of jumping back and forth during the movie in order to keep the audience 's attention . the tension grows as the minutes pass and the mystery is n't entirely solved until the very end . i found the ending to be very clever and quite original because without a good ending this movie could have been easily forgotten . the true heart of this film is the story which has been adapted from the novel la de sus ojos by eduardo sacheri , and the way in which the director is able to put all the pieces together in the movie . the acting in this movie is also superb . ricardo darin is great and soledad villamil also gives a good performance , but it is guillermo francella who really steals every single scene he is in . he is extremely funny and i think his performance is one of the best i 've seen this year , his character just fit him perfectly . this is a great film and well deserving of an oscar although i have n't seen the other movies that are competing in this category . whether it wins or not , this is a movie you wo n't want to miss .		9		1
the other woman , whose original title is love and other impossible pursuits , is a drama feature that stars natalie portman , lisa kudrow , lauren ambrose and scott movie is about about life , loss , and family.it is written and directed by don roos . the plot is about emilia , who is a harvard law school graduate and a newlywed , having just married jack , a high-powered new york lawyer that was her boss and previously married when she began working at his law firm . unfortunately , her life takes an unexpected turn when jack and emilia lose their newborn daughter . emilia struggles through her grief to connect with her new stepson william , while also trying to overcome a long-standing rift in her relationship with her father caused by his own infidelity . but perhaps the most difficult obstacle of all for emilia is trying to cope with the constant interference of her husband 's angry , jealous ex-wife , carolyn . ultimately , emilia 's and charlie 's playful and sometimes tender exchanges help emilia to open her heart and later on , she begins to realize that she was n't responsible for her baby 's death and she begins to take new things into perspective as she rediscover her own capacity for love in time . the movie is a big challenge for natalie portman as she portrays both the protagonist and the antagonist at the same i find her role in a gray area , she did decent in responding into the role but not enough to call it a great work of hers just like she did in black swan . as for the story is concerned , one can either be have pity or be angry with we see her character develop over the course of the film , viewers may have different opinions in the so-called `` other woman '' . overall , it was a good film that can help us understand what women go through in life especially when presented in the same situation as emilia .		9		1
`` how the grinch stole christmas '' is a delightful fantasy-comedy from director ron howard . the film , based on the classic children 's book by dr. seuss , is a fascinating movie to look at . jim carrey makes his performance as the grinch all his own . he was literally the perfect choice to play the unlikable hairy creature with a hatred of christmas . even though he 's not quite as funny as he 's been in some of his earlier films , he 's still fun to watch . the supporting cast is good too , especially 7-year-old newcomer taylor momsen as cindy lou who , the adorable little girl who tries to bring out the sweetness in the grinch . but i think the best thing about `` how the grinch stole christmas '' is the spectacular production design by michael , who worked with howard on `` apollo 13 '' . he and his art decorating team have made the town of whoville come to live like you 've never seen before . the look of whoville is a feast for the eyes , and it 's fascinating . also excellent , the make-up effects done by multi-oscar winner rick baker . he 's responsible for creating the make-up job on turning carrey into the grinch , and once again he and his make-up companions do an a + job . i sure hope the oscar voters are paying attention to this movie , because both the art direction and makeup should get oscar nominations . `` how the grinch stole christmas '' is a great film for the entire family , and judging by it 's record breaking box office statistics , parents have been taking their kids in droves to see this . and well they should . it brought out the kid in me , and brought back memories of when i read the dr. seuss books when i was a child . `` how the grinch stole christmas '' is fun , fun , fun . only a few unnecessary vulgar jokes keep it from being perfect . *** 1/2 -lrb- out of four -rrb-		9		1
the best of the series , sets the story going even with amazing action scenes . has the most concise script : no multiple story lines here , just one central story . the best acting also takes place in this one ; mckellen , mortensen and bean are all excellent . the whole scene in moria is fantastic and possibly my favourite moment in the entire trilogy . the end is n't as epic as in the other two , but it 's still a great finish to the film . as with the entire trilogy , the technical aspects are outstanding : everything from the cinematography to the makeup to the score is excellent . a perfect start to a brilliant trilogy .		9		1
spoiler alert . when i plunged into italian neo-realism -- paisan , open city , bicycle thief -- i had seen most of the earlier movies before i encountered umberto d . it took me by surprise . the tough - mindedness of the earlier films did not prepare me for the naked emotion of this story of a proud pensioner trying to maintain his dignity while on the verge of becoming a homeless person . he could n't bear to beg , so he teaches his dog to beg , but could n't bear to acknowledge it was his dog ! what was this ? sentimental stuff ? a man loves his dog ? he tries , but fails , at begging ? major pathos ? come on ! so , here i was , thinking de sica had gone all maudlin . then came the final 20 minutes . i am not ashamed to admit i was reduced to a puddle . only one other movie ending had had this effect on me -- la strada . umberto gathers up flag and stands in front of a roaring train . umberto -- we 'll go to death together . dog -- get the f *** out of here !!! i do n't blame that dog a bit for scampering away and hiding . `` whoa , dude , how could you pull such a stunt ? can i still trust you ? '' those who criticize this film from an academic standpoint that it betrayed the unsentimental ideals of neo-realism may be correct . i 'll subtract a star . happy ? but this is one powerful movie . i 'll not apologize for loving it . at least , it does n't go all hollywood with `` mr. umberto , do n't you know you 're secretly rich ? '' who knows what will happen to umberto and flag ? he 's still broke . nowhere to go . but they are survivors . dig it .		9		1
i had just finished seeing `` battle royale '' -lrb- import version , naturally -rrb- , and it is by far one of the more intellectually stimulating films i 've seen lately . a class is kidnapped and taken to a remote island in order to do battle to the death in an attempt to claim something more valuable than money : their lives . truthfully , it 's been a long time since i 've seen something like this : compelling , disturbing , dark , frightening , powerful ... the island itself is beautiful , which is a sharp contrast to the doomed seventh graders fighting for survival . while many choose to seek some sort of rationality out of their hopeless scenario , others take delight in unleashing their dark side . an amazing musical score . talented acting . sharp visuals . and yes , while this film is gory , that takes a backseat to the message it gives about man 's desire for survival , no matter the age , or how close a friendship seems to be . i 'd have to agree from another reviewer 's comment that is does have the survival feel of `` lord of the flies '' and the twisted game show mentality of `` running man '' . it comes across as some sort of surreal video game , and quite possibly could have been if it were not for the subject matter . it 's a shame that we live in a society where students really have killed each other in the past . perhaps this film is making a statement about that as well . but i think its intent goes far beyond that parallel . it 's an amazing film . very intelligent , and despite its shocking presentation , it does offer a glimmer of hope in some of these characters that not everyone is easily corruptible . there 's a very fine line between self-defense and outright malicious murder . even the heroes of this film are pushed to that limit . and the ending confrontation of this film does have its moment of truly clever dark humor . i hope american audiences and distributors can come to their senses enough to let this film have at least a dvd release . if you are able to find a copy of this , by all means see this film . i 've seen very few films that have left me guessing like this or even impressed me on the level that this has . it 's not a slasher flick . see it for yourself and make your own call . definitely recommended .		9		1
session 9 takes place predominantly at a long closed mental hospital , and basically follows five characters for 90 % of the film : gordon -- the boss . phil -- longtime mate of gordon . detests ... hank -- larrikin who dates phil 's ex and reminds him often . mike -- smart guy slumming it with manual labour . jeff -- gordon 's nephew . typical young dumb kid . they are an asbestos removal crew cleaning up the hospital , bagging the job by undercutting their rivals - and perhaps with the timeframe . most movies show everyone as buddies , they 're all the same age and never argue . anyone who has worked in an office or workplace with more than a few other people knows this is rarely the case . after we meet the crew the film moves day by day , so will i. monday the cleanup , the hospital is expansive so the five guys spread out , sometimes in small teams , others alone . during the lunch break they trade stories . mike explains why the hospital was shut down . a radical treatment called repressed memory treatment , created false claims from patients involving incest , murder and even worse . of course once these claims were proved false the lawsuits started and sent the hospital broke . the building is obviously deteriorating , power to the workers is a bit dodgy and they are dealing with old and fragile areas , the building itself is a key character in the film , and it is genuinely spooky . mike finds a box marked `` evidence '' in an old storeroom and starts killing time listening to the recorded interviews , over the course of the film he periodically goes back to listen further . at the end of the first day the guys congratulate each other on a good start to the job and head off , we realize that gordon has hurt his leg but is hiding this from the others . tuesday hank makes a find that he conceals from the others hoping to take financial advantage himself . meanwhile mike listens to further reels , the patient mary is obviously quite troubled , with multiple personalities -lrb- thankfully with different voices -rrb- . anderson masterfully continues playing the interview dialogue over montages of the 5 guys going about their business , it is genuinely disconcerting at times to hear the creepy discussions when watching people who are blissfully ignorant of the situation , doing everyday things . this never got old for me . after they break for the day hank heads back alone to further investigate his find , and once he finds the source of the stash he happily goes about gathering up the goodies , oblivious to all around him . for 40 minutes now the rising stress level has been noticeable , the chills started for me here and rarely abated until the credits rolled . wednesday the tension is building between the team -- even old friends gordon and phil are snapping at each other , the deadline is approaching , and the team risks losing a large cash bonus if they fail to meet it - and hank has n't shown up for work . near the end of the day gordon breaks down and tells phil why he has been so on edge -- work pressures have spilled over at home and he feels terrible and guilty . he immediately swore phil to secrecy . we soon find out that gordon is actually sleeping in his van at the site , as he is too ashamed to go home . thursday early in the day phil mutters to himself `` this is gon na get ugly '' , and how right he is . everything from here seems more rushed and urgent , and while i was watching i was as confused and stressed as the characters to find out what the hell was going on . at this stage i started feeling anxious for the film to end so i could work out what was happening , i can think of no higher praise for a horror movie than this personally , something that is scary enough that you want it to end but still enjoy every minute of the unease . friday within minutes the happenings of the previous 80 odd minutes are fully explained , and far from a letdown i found the payoff to be genuinely disturbing and above all more believable than any horror movie that i 've seen in years , if ever . the only spoiler free thing i can say from here is that the credits roll and you should be very satisfied . music is left to the most minimal piano , literally three or four `` '' before stopping , leaving room for the superior use of background sound and other effects . even the of the tape reel creates a tension of its own . there are no `` jump '' scares accompanied by a loud unnecessary noise . the camera lingers for about two seconds longer than should be required - you never really know if there is a reason , if you are missing something or if something will still happen in the scene . again this is a good thing , the scares are created by the tension in your own mind as you strive to work out what is happening . the hospital is old and run down , with some brilliant open spaces , underground areas and also confined spaces that anderson takes advantage of , some great camera-work takes you through multiple areas at once seamlessly , to see various characters working nearby . anderson realizes what is scary and then does n't vary his vision once through the entire film , there was nothing cheap about the film , everything was well earned and carefully planned without shortcuts . final rating -- 9 / 10 . not only the best horror movie i 've seen in years , one of the best movies period . sometimes it is n't what you see but what you do n't see that is scary . if you liked this -lrb- or even if you did n't -rrb- try oneguyrambling.com		9		1
woody allen is a legend , his work goes down as remarkable efforts in cinema . ` deconstructing harry ' is a yet another classic from this person i love , it 's such a riveting , hilarious and happening journey . woody allen is a highly confident person , his love for saying stories pack in tremendous confidence . ` deconstructing harry ' is amongst his well-done works , mainly because allen uses his characters and does justice to them . a set of highly talented actors are used in brief roles , but each has something to do , each contributes in the goings-on . the culmination is the main stay of the film , it 's fantastic and wonderfully executed . allen 's writing and direction are perfect , as always . carlo di palma 's camera-work , in my opinion , is fantastic . in acting , allen is the show stealer . kirstie alley is incredible . robin williams is invisible . stanley tucci is superb . billy crystal is good . demi moore is very good , she stands out . tobey maguire does a fine cameo . julia louis-dreyfus gets a hilarious scene to her kitty and she does full justice to it . judy davis is alright . ` deconstructing harry ' is truly a yet another classic from this film legend . must watch ! two thumbs up !		9		1
so intensely close to perfect , it 's frightening . the batman franchise created by bob kane has stood the test of time for over 6 decades and there has to be a reason for that ? use the basics , do n't stray from what was created and that 's what batman begins has done . batman is about bruce wayne and his quest for vengeance and justice , what created him , how does he fight so well ?? batman begins gives us all that and so much more . bruce wayne treks across the world to escape the guilt he feels about his parents ' brutal murder by a street thug . he comes across the mysterious ducard who works for someone named ra 's al ghul who is in command of `` the league of shadows . '' ducard leads wayne to their temple and begins to train him mercilessly and purge him of his fears and guilt creating the perfect vigilante skilled in the arts of ninja and utilizing fear . wayne is distraught to learn that ra 's al ghul only trained him to lead a ninja army back to gotham and destroy it believing it to be an evil city that needs to be wiped out . wayne destroys the temple and only saves ducard . he returns to gotham where he has been absent for 7 years . his company , wayne enterprises is being broken up and sold on the public stock market , and his faithful butler and former guardian alfred meets him to welcome him home . wayne explains his plans to become a symbol of justice and fear against the evil . with the help of wayne enterprises tech man lucius fox wayne gets everything he needs to become the thing he feared the most ... the bat . big time mobster carmine falcone is moving drugs into gotham for an investor who he is communicating with him through jonathan crane . crane is using the drugs to experiment on patients in arkham asylum . the drugs cause the patients to go insane with fear . crane himself is donning a mask that gases his victims and taking on the moniker of the scarecrow . no one in law enforcement will touch falcone , either being paid off by him or afraid to go after him by themselves like the district attorney , and sargent jim gordon , a good cop without any help . batman goes after him gets all the necessary leverage to help gordon take him down and have him arrested . bruce wayne does his best to keep up his double life as wayne and batman until crane 's boss makes himself known , and will be bruce wayne and batman 's ultimate adversary in a battle to save gotham from being completely obliterated with the insanity toxin . i so badly want to tack a huge 10 out of 10 on this but there is some slight downfalls to this fantastic film . katie holmes ... she might be a good actress , i do n't know , but she 's not right for this role or this film . she sticks out from the rest of the cast and never fits . the ending of the film felt a little tacked on , like it was trying to wrap things up too quickly . i was a little disappointed with the entirely redesigned batmobile which was more of a battle tank and the whole sliding under thing for the guns looked a bit ridiculous . do n't let any of that steer you away from the truly amazing job christopher nolan did with this film , not to mention the incredible actors in the film . how did nolan bring the amazing michael caine , liam neeson , morgan freeman , and gary oldman into this film ?? michael caine as alfred was a risky move . caine is a big screen presence and could have overshadowed christian bale but they utilize him very carefully and make him an important part of bruce wayne 's existence , as he should be , not just a butler but his friend , father figure , protector , partner . liam neeson also adds to this amazing cast as wayne 's trainer and mentor and also in a less than familiar role that i wo n't get into so as to not spoil the entire movie . morgan freeman plays a small but important role as the tech guy giving bruce wayne everything he needs to be batman . finally you have gary oldman who usually gets on my nerves but he 's cleverly done up and plays a soft spoken yet honest cop in the future commissioner gordon . this cast clicks together amazingly . and finally and perhaps most importantly the absolutely stunning casting job of christian bale . this guy was made to play bruce wayne and batman . bale is like straight from the comic books into the movies . both his portrayals are remarkable and he could n't be any more dead on !!! this guy rocks !! this film is so dead on accurate to the comics and yet translates it to the screen so flawlessly . gotham is beautifully depicted and one of the greatest things is this film does not use cgi or at least cleverly disguises it . a huge hats off to nolan for creating such an amazing action film with such little obvious cgi , it can be done !! this film takes us from wayne 's beginnings to his becoming the batman . it shows us his fear , his emotions , his raw side . as batman he shows anger , and revenge . the film is almost epic in scale and never focus ' on just one aspect of wayne or batman . for any batman , super hero fan you need to see this film . i think they can definitely turn this into the new series and obliterate the mistakes made with the previous installments , but they have to keep the same level of class and creativity with it . the film is not as dark as everyone claims it to be but it 's just right and fits the bill . a must see !! 9/10		9		1
maggie fitzgerald , a poor thirty-one year old waitress from the very lower classes and with a dysfunctional loser family , decides to make a difference through boxing . she convinces the experienced hardened boxing trainer frankie dunn to coach her and be her manager , with the support of his old partner eddie scrap-iron dupris , who sees her potential as a boxer . frankie has a problematical relationship with his daughter , and practically adopts maggie along her career . overall , this is one of the best films ever . this was the best film of 2004 , which won it an oscar for best picture , of course . this film is strong , powerful , dramatic , and is a total knockout ! the acting by the leading trio -lrb- clint eastwood , hilary swank , and morgan freeman -rrb- are all fantastic ! there are some scenes that makes your stomachs turn and some scenes that make you laugh . this is a terrific film with everything you want in a good film . it has some dark and sad moments and light and comedic moments . you 'll love this film if you actually want to see a good one .		9		1
a biker called rose crashes near an unorthodox surgery . she is taken there for emergency treatment which entails a new experimental skin graft operation . rose develops a phallic appendage that she uses to attain human blood , the only thing that can sustain her new biology . in doing so she maims her victims , transmitting a form of rabies onto them . david cronenberg 's debut feature shivers was extremely bold , original and visceral . he followed it up with rabid which explores similar territory . in some ways it 's a more expansive film but overall less intense . in this story the virus affects a whole city , so cronenberg is able to incorporate more locations and action . on the other hand it 's less claustrophobic than the nightmare that was the apartment block in shivers . it would only be fair to say that the science is somewhat less clear and more ambiguous in rabid too . we never really know how it comes to be that rose develops the mutation . all we know for sure is that it 's an unexpected side effect of the experimental skin graft surgery . we also never really understand rose 's motivations , although it does seem like she is unaware of her blood lust . what is for sure though is that rabid is another extremely interesting entry in cronenberg 's cycle of body horror movies that underlines his genius . when the director was informed once that he was the king of venereal horror he replied ` it 's a small field but at least i 'm king of it ' . in order to give their movie an angle over the multitude of other low budget horror films , the production company suggested marilyn chambers for the lead role . at the time she was the world 's number one porn actress , so her presence would guarantee the film some automatic visibility . as it turned out , she was very good in the lead role and certainly suggested that she could have done more proper acting . the film itself is an interesting twist on the vampire myth , with the influence of george romero never far from the surface with some references to the likes of the crazies . pleasingly , as well as being as idiosyncratic as cronenberg is , rabid also works as a pure horror film . there are plenty of gory set-pieces and grotesque rabid lunatics . the canadian setting provides other value too . the cold landscapes and sterile urban architecture really accentuates the feel that cronenberg is going for , while the ending is very nihilistic and just perfect for this story .		9		1
it 's kind of hard to describe `` the triplets of belleville '' other than to say that it 's truly original . it made me long for the days of old-fashioned hand-drawn animation , the kind that disney revolutionized before turning to cgi . interestingly enough , there 's a car chase scene toward the end of the film that reminded me of `` 101 dalmatians , '' and i said as much to my wife while we were watching it . it was something about the way the cars were drawn and moved , and the color palate in general . then in the supplementary materials , one of the film 's creators cites `` 101 dalmatians '' as an inspiration , so i was able to congratulate myself on my perceptiveness . it does n't take much to make me happy : -rrb- grade : a -		9		1
nothing is easy for michael clayton . he gambles a lot , owes money after a failed restaurant business , tries to make time for his son after a messy divorce , drives fancy cars , wears suits that come out of a fashion detailed magazine , and yet , works for the highest litigation office in new york city where he 's not a lawyer but a `` fixer '' . he 's someone that the lawyers can depend on if the clients are n't happy or somebody has a dirty secret that needs to be wiped away fast . he 's just a janitor who cleans up the mess that everybody 's afraid to touch . george clooney plays michael clayton in which this time the cards are on the table . he receives news from the head lawyer marty bach -lrb- sydney pollock -rrb- that one of their attorneys -lrb- tom wilkinson -rrb- has gone off the brink of insanity after stripping his clothes down to people on the biggest case of bringing down a corrupted organic company that has been killing off their customers . arthur edens -lrb- wilkinson -rrb- knows the truth about the organic company and will do almost anything in bringing down c.e.o. karen crowder -lrb- tilda swinton -rrb- after a guilty conscience . the clock is ticking for clayton as he must do what he can in helping edens while getting the feeling that crowder and her people will do what they can in making sure that the guilty conscience lawyer does n't speak . with the film at nearly two hours , each of the three principal actors do a good job in their performances . george clooney has never failed as an actor when he 's doing comedy or being serious and he does an excellent job as michael clayton . tom wilkinson 's performance has been compared to peter finch 's howard beale from the movie `` network '' in which they 're both mad as hell and not going to take it anymore , and yet , wilkinson steals the spotlight in his finest american film role . tilda swinton , who took home the best supporting actress award for her role as the villain , has never had her hands clean or dirty in the film if you get my drift . her performance will go down as one of the movie 's memorable villains in a dramatic role . a very good flick !		9		1
i remember as a child being shown this as a short film entertainment between classes at my primary school and being beguiled by it even then . watching it now as an adult , it still has a fascination which is hard to describe in mere words but the closest i can get to it is that it embodies the magic of cinema itself . the simplest of tales unfolds as an apparently friendless and unloved infant boy encounters a bright red balloon which appears to have a mind of its own , which becomes a lively adventure through the poorer parts of mid-50 's paris . the cinematography is wonderful , with characterful and colourful shots of the streets of the capital . one can read all types of symbolism at work here , the balloon as mischievous companion , or imaginary friend or even the spirit of adventure . eventually the film ends with the lad 's escape from the gang of young bullies as he literally rises above his cares and flies away in a beautiful climax , which had to have influenced the creators of pixar 's `` up '' . this near-silent movie is at once a celebration of cinema and freedom from care and is as good a way to spend 30 minutes as you could get .		9		1
and i do n't mean that the movie is weird . i like that . everyone should appreciate the freshness of this movie . what i mean is that the screenplay is a little uneven . when i first saw this film -lrb- on opening day , luckily -rrb- , i liked it a lot but felt that there was a major problem . it took me months to figure out why i felt this way , but i did finally figure it out , and i have confirmed it on subsequent viewings . the first half hour or so , all the screen time before the portal is found , contains an entirely different humor than the rest of the picture . and this humor is mostly childish and unfunny . the secretary and the joke about her being an expert on speaking disabilities was very unfunny . i feel embarrassed when i watch it it 's so bad . the video about why the 7 1/2 floor exists is also extremely unfunny , as well as the 7 1/2 floor itself . i did n't find any of these things funny , and there were even more than that . i did like the puppet show that craig gave on the street corner , i did like dr. lester 's sexual rantings -lrb- although dirty old men jokes are really commonplace -rrb- , and i laughed a lot when craig was guessing maxine 's name . fortunately , when the portal is found , the childish humor pretty much completely vanishes . the rest of this movie is very intelligent . every joke hits . there are no misses like there are in the first half hour . but what is really special about this film is how smoothly it becomes a compelling drama and character study . it is so well filmed . watch how the craig , lottie , and maxine dolls are used all through the film . i really felt it when maxine was covering up the lottie puppet . i actually teared up during the chase through malkovich 's subconscious , which i think is probably the single best scene that appeared in a film in 1999 . and i also wept at the very , very , very beautiful ending . the second time i saw this in a theater , they cut out the beginning of the credit sequence where emily was swimming , and i absolutely screamed , telling everyone in the theater about the sham that had been pulled . and i found the ending even more startling on the third viewing because i had n't realized what actually happened to craig at the end on my first and second viewings . i love this movie , so i am very hurt by the childish humor in the first half hour . it does embarrass me . it detracts from the whole film . overall , i have to give it a 9/10 .		9		1
very good movie . everyone 's acting was superb and the story was excellent . the rap battles were really well done and no one could have told that they were lip sinked -lrb- which they were -rrb- . the last rap battle he did was his best . the lines were just outstanding . eminem 's performance was out of this world . not one scene in the movie should n't have been there . if they were going to make a sequel to it i think that would be a very good idea -lrb- if they could find a story line to base it around . it 's a movie that you can tell has had a lot of time and effort put into it . overall this would have to be one of the best movies ever made about a person 's life . i really hope they find a story line for the sequel .		9		1
keith nelson , much to everyone else 's surprise , lands a date with amanda jones , the most popular girl in school . but with amanda comes trouble in the form of the ex-boyfriend , hardy jenns . a rich spoilt egotistical bully , jenns plans to get back at keith violently . while things are further complicated by the fact that keith 's best friend watts is hopelessly in love with him , something that keith is oblivious too . all roads , rocky or otherwise , are leading to one house party where lives are about to be changed . released a year after pretty in pink , writer john hughes further cemented his status as the king of teenage angst with this funny , charming and entertaining picture . following a similar formula to that used in pretty in pink , some kind of wonderful deals not only in young love thematics , but also in opposites breaking down barriers , bullies and the spectre of parental pressure . keith -lcb- eric stoltz -rcb- is from humble working class stock , the idea of dating the more affluent amanda -lcb- lea thompson -rcb- would seem idiotic at best . the characters may move in different circles , but hughes , as is his want , thrusts the issue to the front whilst dangling little strands in the background . time is given to the father -lcb- an impressive john ashton -rcb- and son axis , where career pressure is raised . and the delightful old chestnut of fitting in at school , or not as the case may be as regards watts -lcb- a tremendous and sensual mary stuart masterton -rcb- is also putting in an appearance . it 's often forgotten in hughes `` angsty '' films , that they are n't merely love stories for the young and restless . they are all encompassing pieces that hold up better than ever on revisits today . yes there is pandering to certain expectations , and yes the endings never veer away from a tried and trusted method . but hughes knew what worked for him and his audience . that he never attempted to insult us -lcb- them -rcb- with sledgehammer tactics , or trick of the twist dallying , is really rather refreshing when viewing them today . some kind of wonderful is quite simply a wonderful film , with great comedy -lcb- check out the fabulous elias koteas -rcb- and a banging soundtrack , it ranks as one of the finest efforts crafted from the pen of a very fine writer . 9/10		9		1
this has to be the funniest send up of those teen musicals that could only come from the imagination of writer/director john waters -lrb- hairspray , pecker -rrb- . starring johnny depp and amy locane -lrb- blue sky , going all the way -rrb- with a supporting cast that is familiar and fun : polly bergen -lrb- `` desperate housewives '' -rrb- , iggy pop , ricki lake -lrb- both -rrb- , porn queen traci lords , troy donahue , willem dafoe , and many more ' with fantastic singing by james and rachel sweet -lrb- i have to get this soundtrack ! -rrb- . if you like john waters and the music of the 50s , then this is a movie that you will not want to miss . depp and locane are to die for ! yes , it has some waters wildness peppered in and that makes it a must-see .		9		1
not only talking about the plot and/or how it does develop and how it is portrayed in the movie . because within all it 's violence and -lrb- full metal -rrb- training sessions , there is much to be found -lrb- criticism and heart -rrb- . but i still was surprised , that this movie won the golden -lrb- bear -rrb- award at the berlin film . not really a movie that i would have bet on to be a winner , because it did n't feel like a festival would condone it 's violence and rawness . but i was wrong and the jury did acknowledge the quality of the movie , the actors and the -lrb- handheld -rrb- rawness , which is styled to look like a documentary ! it is a bit complex -lrb- story-wise and structure wise -rrb- , but it 's more than worth a watch !		9		1
bravo ... bravo ... this was a fun movie to watch . perhaps dark at times , but fun to watch . ca n't say much else . the only draw back is some of you may not like the art house elements . this movie had great camera angles . i loved it . 9 out of 10		9		1
since i 'll inevitably see the remake at some point too , i finally got around to watching the day the earth stood still -lrb- 1951 -rrb- . by all means , a fine little classic sci-fi gem by a great director -lrb- robert wise -rrb- , carrying a message on the human condition that even in this day and age could n't be more accurate . amazing how the actuality of this film has not aged a single day since its release in 1951 . in ways , this was a visionary film . different things than which it speaks of are going on nowadays , but the message stays the same : our human condition is a poor one . the inability of the human race to work together . the greed . the warmongering . the way we more easily manage to destroy things on this planet than we 're able to save them . it 's one of the few sci-fi films that , in a simple and effective way , makes sense : if peace-loving aliens -lrb- living in harmony with their planet -rrb- should see us acting the way we do down here , it makes perfect sense that they would fear the day we 'd manage to stumble into outer space to see what all we could conquer , litter or blow out of the way . consider this my two cents , as all else about this classic has already been said , far better , by others . trivia for horror fans : sam raimi payed tribute to this film in army of darkness by having bruce campbell try and remember the words ... `` klaatu barada nikto '' .		9		1
if we are fortunate , we all grow old , and we see the bright spark of youth all around us and we ca n't participate . sometimes there are moments when one does n't see what is happening around him or her . signals are sent and received , and because of our longing for a past time , we can become victimized by our own longings . this is a film about a man who is as respected as one can be . college professors in germany at this time were a little like rock stars . unfortunately , the students were n't always the ones to show the respect and they could become a little nasty . the professor makes a fatal mistake . because of his seriousness in his long life , he has not stopped to smell the archetypal roses . when he becomes infatuated with the leggy marlene dietrich , it 's all over . she is a consummate flirt . she is not an unkind person . she flirts with all men . after all she works in a music hall . how the professor could be so shortsighted is not known , but there are thousands of such cases where old men have sold their lives for a few moments of affection . he wakes up when it is too late . i remember this movie fondly . our local public television station picked up the janus film festival . and some of my ta friends from grad school would meet on nights to watch these . it was my introduction into the viewing of significant films . renoir , trauffaut , lang , etc. . it was a marvelous time and we learned a lot .		9		1
i am almost ashamed to say it , but i only recently saw this film for the first time at the ripe old age of 36 . after it was over , i thought , `` why on earth did i wait so long ? '' . this is really a fun movie full of adventure , romance , with a healthy dose of laughs . errol flynn , by far gives the most credible performance of the robin hood character.he oozes charm and wit , here.this film is a great trip back to a special time in movie making when we did n't need extreme sex and violence to entertain that i have seen it , this movie definitely goes on my video you have children , or if you love to feel like one , as i do , i highly suggest you give this a film .		9		1
after a fateful mistake costing his career , an ex-soccer player bum meets a shaolin kung fu student trying to spread the word of kung fu . the ex-soccer player helps reconcile with his five brothers , and teaches them soccer , adding shaolin kung fu as a twist . if you like action films , this is a very good one . it has exhilarating special effects and great kung fu action ! if you want to watch a very funny satirical movie , this is also a very good one . the jokes are very funny and clever . basically , this movie is really good mixing both the humor and action making this one of the best movies ever made . it has great dialog with good acting by stephen chow and zhao wei . this is a film that is emotional , very funny , and a really good action film . if you like any of that , watch it and you 'll love it because it 's a classic !		9		1
this gave me a man crush on tim robbins after seeing him acted so well . and all this time around i was thinking `` where did i saw elizabeth pena before ? '' and `` oh , alright that 's here , that 's got to be her ? no way !? '' i never heard of this film ever but browsing here in imdb gave me chances to catch a glimpse of never before seen films that got so much of beauty of its area . this is the first film of tim robbins i saw , and the much classic and acclaimed `` shawshank redemption '' has to be him ! there are still so much films in line in my list for this man -lrb- e.g. shawshank redemption , mystic river , the arlington road , the player , hudsucker proxy , the secret life of words and more -rrb- . many would say the story of jacob 's ladder is rather predictable or maybe i 'm just new to this area that i did n't grasp what the film truly meant . it was a horror film in the first place , but it was more of a drama side actually . its quiet terrifying how much of an ordeal one has to go through before accepting death . it 's sensible but disturbing . jacob 's horrifying experience had to be a realization , a fight disguised in hideous recollections , repeatedly telling him to let go , make peace of you and accept death . there so much punishment he experienced only to think that everything was for his good . i 'm quiet confused why gabe is uncredited in this film but nevertheless he 's the character that waited for jacob 's redemption and peace sit in . this film dramatic side gives me the chills , appreciating the beauty of the character 's experiences . but i would not deny the creepy side . that hospital scene could indeed make anyone sick more than ever . the demons were really disturbing , the atmosphere was eerie and i wish i could see the deleted scenes to emphasize more what i missed . but the current release is fine , it holds true to its intentions and i would recommend this to anyone .		9		1
there have been many existential stories , but few so interesting as `` being there '' . it stars peter sellers in his last role of note , as mentally retarded gardener chance , who occasionally utters what he heard on tv . after his employer dies , he wonders the city and eventually gets picked up by wealthy ben rand -lrb- melvyn douglas , who won best supporting actor -rrb- and his wife eve -lrb- shirley maclaine -rrb- . as the movie progresses , two things become apparent : chance 's comments - which he himself does n't really understand - get interpreted by everyone as deep philosophical statements , and the are not really living as they want . if nothing else , this movie underscores how talented the three stars are , and what a great director hal ashby was -lrb- he also directed such greats as `` harold and maude '' , `` the last detail '' , `` shampoo '' , `` bound for glory '' and `` coming home '' -rrb- . peter sellers is as keen here as he was as insp. clouseau or in `` dr. strangelove '' . when shirley maclaine made her debut back in the '50s , who ever would have guessed that she would eventually , uh , play with herself in a movie ? and melvyn douglas certainly deserved his oscar . a great , existential flick .		9		1
pitch black , the bogeyman , is using nightmares to destroy kids ' belief in the essentials of childhood , so north -lrb- aka father christmas -rrb- gathers together the guardians of those essentials - the tooth fairy , the easter bunny , the sandman and a newly appointed jack frost - to protect them . this cgi movie is aimed at children , but has a lot in it to please adults . the story is essentially a straightforward good-vs-evil affair , but the script is good and has heart . the characters are all well conceived and designed , and the voice talent is solid -lrb- hugh jackman 's aggressively australian easter bunny is the most obvious , but all the characters are done well . the animation and look of the film is terrific , and the 3d is superb - seeing this in 3d is recommended . this is an excellent family film .		9		1
i was n't a big fan of james gunns last outing before this one . slither did n't feel like the movie it could 've been for me . and though quite a lot of people know some of his work -lrb- especially the `` '' short movies he produced -rrb- , they might not have known that it is this director right here , making them . then again you have nathan fillion here -lrb- of firefly fame and star of slither -rrb- , but also a great cast . liv tyler , rainn wilson , kevin bacon and ellen page . especially the latter is just really giving it all for her role . you can actually feel the excitement the character has flowing through the screen right over to you . i should point out though , that the humor of the movie is not to everyones taste . you have to like non-pc kind of stuff to really enjoy this . it also does not follow any rules or cares about your expectations . which all makes this a great movie . again , it is special and it wo n't appeal to a big audience -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- , but those who watched it and loved it , will cherish it 's `` cojones '' to do stuff that no other `` superhero '' movie has done -lrb- so far -rrb- . for real -lrb- literally and metaphorically speaking -rrb- !!!		9		1
michael 's in distress , but this time with a better , more bearable plot . more so than revealing the `` flip side '' of sexual harassment , what this movie excels in is showing , vividly and accurately , how incredibly arbitrary and screwed up american corporate management can be . demi 's character is a little overplayed , but in general the film moves along and resolves very nicely .		9		1

it is n't every day that you see a studio let $ 100 million be spent on a film guaranteed to get an r-rating . terminator 2 & 3 , troy and gladiator are perhaps the only other films i can name that also match those characteristics . starship troopers was not a success at the box office , but it has done well in the dvd market over the years . it is a very good film with something for everyone , but it may be too gory for some viewers . our story centers on a futuristic society here on earth who is at war with a species of giant insects on a distant planet . our main characters are mostly young people who grew up in buenos aries , where apparently the english language and mostly white people will come to dominate the landscape one day . the society in which they live seems to have two classes of people . citizens and civilians . the citizens are people who have served in the military or in the government . we are led to believe that citizens are the upper class , but our main character comes from a civilian family and they seem to have a huge house , so it might not be such a bad thing to be a civilian , either . you do have to be a citizen to go into politics or things like that , though . to impress his sweetie , our hero johnny rico enlists with her into military service . too bad for him , because he only qualifies for the infantry , where life is tough and likely short in times of war . she is sent to flight school , and another of their friends qualifies for military intelligence . after an accident in training where one of his squad is killed , rico plans to quit the military and go back home . however , he has no home to return to . the bugs have somehow sent a huge asteroid to earth and it obliterates ... you guessed it ... buenos aries . now rico decides to stay in the military to help wipe out these bugs . the rest of the film has a number of exciting battles and gory special effects to keep your interest . starship troopers is a cut above most sci/fi films . not only does it look fantastic , but it has some deeper philosophical motives . there is more to it than just the battles between humans and insects . we get an in-depth look at this militaristic and in some ways fascist society . the basic training footage is exceptional , and the story is narrated by a series of helpful newsreel type snippets that are always asking ... `` would you like to know more ? '' i always did . much has been made of the fascist nature of the society and the cast . it did n't really bother me because verhoeven 's direction always keeps you focusing on the battles and the f/x . i 'm betting the political issues of this film were a little more prevalent at the screenplay level , and glossed over more during filming . one thing that this film 's satirizing of fascism keeps tripping over is the nature of the enemy they are facing . we 've all been raised to despise fascism , but when it 's humans vs bugs , you ca n't help but root for the humans even if they are fascists . perhaps if their enemies looked more human like in enemy mine , it would have been harder to cheer for the federation . but by the time this film was over , i was cheering right along with their propaganda films . i saw the film as a shoot 'em up more that a satire . the fact that this film did n't make a profit at the box office guaranteed that a good sequel would not have been made . i 've not seen part 2 , but i 've heard it is n't good . i would definitely recommend starship troopers to anyone , though . it works on many levels , and it 's sure to be a cult favorite for years to come . one more thing about denise richards . the woman is too attractive to be anything more than a model . she looks so good that you ca n't even pay attention to what she 's saying . as an actress , she 'll always struggle , i 'm afraid . charlie sheen must be the most picky man on earth . i wonder what the problem was . does she grind her teeth at night or something ??? 9 of 10 stars . the hound .		9		1
tank girl was a movie i had heard about for some years , but had never sought it out ; not something i thought would make for quality viewing , some silly mid 90s comedy about some weird girl hero or other . boy , was i wrong ! this is a definition of guilty pleasure , or close to it for a mid 90s comic book movie , and it 's one i would be more than happy to pop in on a sick day from work . it 's a movie you have to smile at , feel like both the kid in you and the dirty bastard or girly girl loves to chomp on like some stupid comic book that has all the meat and gravy of a full-throttle action story mixed in with lots of irreverent humor . it pops and crackles like a comic book -lrb- hell , it even throws in animated segways , maybe as a way to save money , but it looks as cool as anything from the period -rrb- , and it 's got a weird ensemble ranging from malcom mcdowell to iggy pop and ice-t ... as a kangaroo . lori petty stars in what could be considered a real career high point . before seeing her in this i only remembered her as geena davis 's sister in a league of her own , and wondered if she could pull it off . at first her image is like a junkyard gwen stefani -lrb- and stefani of no doubt period -rrb- , but she 's got the attitude of a real bad-ass , which is important as her role in this often pitts her into the likes of snake plissken and some other cowboy types , but always with the spunk of a punk rock chick with style and wit to spare . she 's in a post apocalyptic world where water is a precious commodity -lrb- though , unlike waterworld , it does n't flaunt the irony of ` all this water and not a drop to drink ' , albeit there 's a hot ` dust ' shower scene -rrb- . a mad commander of a corporation -lrb- mcdowell , subtle ham-bone if there could be an oxymoron as such -rrb- who controls water and , thus , power . he captures her for hard slave labor , but she teams up with a young naomi watts and escapes to a renegade gang of kangaroos as they plot to destroy the evil corporation and ... yeah , kangaroos , and that 's not all - one of them is really half kangaroo and half dog ! it 's all very silly , but it revels in its silliness , and makes a note of every other second or so reminding you how buoyant it is with its reckless energy and humor and design . it 's a lot like if a sci-fi channel of the week movie actually worked well ; the production design is n't too tacky and eye-catching on a fairly low budget , the actors are all having a ball playing odds and ends of good guys or kangaroos or villainous water mongers . and at the middle is petty , who is sweet and charming and dangerous and puts on an outfit and hair style like a reject from the latest hot topic catalog -lrb- and damn proud of it -rrb- . you kind of have to dig what she 's about in the part to dig a lot of the picture , but once plugged in - on top of stuff like mcdowell 's reconstruction surgery , watts with black hair and glasses , and ice-t and that guy from buffy as kangaroo manimals - it 's hard not to have a total gas with it . if you were a kid in the 90s , its hard not to have a go at it .		9		1
have the coen brothers ever made a bad film ?? i mean really , they always have topnotch acting , their writing is always excellent , the direction , cinematography , and editing is always superb . o brother where art thou gets even better when you see what they did to get the get that great dust bowl era look . full of quirky characters , as in all of their film , this movie gets better and better with each viewing . excellent music , and well thought out story adaptation have me giving this one a 9/10 .		9		1
british director carol reed could n't have made a more perfect choice for his film noir taking place in post-war vienna than to hire local entertainer anton karas to compose a zither score for it . the unique theme climbed the charts worldwide and has become an instant evergreen , common even to those who have never ever seen the film itself . yet the score is only one among many things that make `` the third man '' essential viewing . while the music makes the picture distinctly austrian , it was also shot entirely on location , complete with land marks , bombed out buildings , the vast viennese cemetery and its sewer system . even famous austrian actors got bits parts and added to the general look and feel . this is what post-war vienna was all about . the screenplay , written superbly by graham greene , is pure gold . it entraps the viewer in a web of black-market treachery , intrigue and deception narrated by the traditional film noir voice-over and feels like a detective story that eventually reaches existential depth . the action takes place in a divided country where the future is uncertain and anything goes to make a buck if you just do it right and are n't caught , and that 's exactly what happens . the acting by cotton , welles , howard and valli leaves nothing to be desired , also the picture features one of the most legendary entrances of a character in movie history ... the cinematography is a first rate lesson in style with all its tilted angles , beautiful lighting , shadows creeping along the walls , rarely seen in such impeccable mis-en-scene . just consider the famous last shot of the film showing a character walking out of screen : it lasts nearly one and a half minutes and deftly condenses the whole drama that has taken place until then in a poignant visual convergence , the icing on film noir bliss . well , and there 's always that music . that incomparable , melancholic , bizarre , yet wonderful catchy music that will ring in your ears for quite a while ...		9		1
koyaanisqatsi contains and unreels some of the most breathtaking images ever committed to celluloid . translated from the hopi language , the title means ` life out of balance ' and attempts - and very successfully - shows all of man 's manifestations , usually in startling close-up but also often sped-up , juxtaposed against our surroundings . since dziga vertov 's 1928 russian experimental film `` man with a movie camera '' , a few pioneering directors have attempted to show familiar , and not so familiar surroundings in a new and refreshing way . but none so much as the collaboration here between godfrey reggio and contemporary composer philip glass . the images are always hypnotic , some unearthly beautiful and when it slowed to its climax , i was so disappointed it had finished . the comparisons between printed circuit boards to conveyor belt manufacturing to highly urbanised street scenes are magical and compulsive . watch on the biggest screen you can and play the sound through a separate hi-fi or home cinema system . glass ' music follows and resonates with these streams of visuals - one is the other . with executive producers francis ford copolla and george lucas , both mega directors of their day , this project had some heavyweight backing . koyaanisqatsi was followed by the powaqqatsi which has a different take on human activity .		9		1
walter murch 's 1985 disney release `` return to oz '' is a relatively unknown film . i was born three years after its release , but remember vividly watching a vhs copy that my my sister taped off of tv . it was a striking film , haunting and joyful . in the same spirit as other 80 's fantasy -lrb- `` the dark crystal '' , `` neverending story '' , etc -rrb- , it was a dark ride . when i saw it on dvd last year , i had to grab it ! while it is not an official sequel to the classic judy garland film , it could be viewed that way , or as a stand-alone film . it opens a few months after dorothy returns from oz . missing her friends , and unable to sleep , aunt em takes her to dr. worley , who plans on using the latest therapy -lrb- electro-shock -rrb- to cure her of what he believes are delusions and dreams . however , another patient of worley helps dorothy escape , and she is swept up in a river , passing out . she awakens back in oz , with her pet chicken -lrb- toto remained behind in kansas -rrb- , to discover that oz is in ruins . the yellow brick road is faded and tattered , the emerald city has been ransacked , and everyone in the kingdom has been turned to stone . worse , strange demonic creatures called `` wheelers '' live there now , under the control of the evil witch mombi and the dreaded nome king . dorothy must team up with new friends -lrb- including the clockwork solider tick-tock , the kind-hearted jack pumpkinhead , and the strange being called the `` gump '' -rrb- to stop mombi and the nome king , and restore oz to its past glory . the film is quite a departure from the colorful , joyful oz we are all used to . the film has an unrelenting sense of dread and melancholy that will initially shock you . but there is also a great deal of creativity to the film , and it does lighten up towards the end . like i said , this is very much an 80 's fantasy movie , back when family films were dark , edgy and sometimes downright tragic . it is for a specific audience , and may not be appropriate for all children . from an aesthetic standpoint , the film is very remarkable . murch 's direction is phenomenal -lrb- it 's too bad he never directed another film -rrb- , the set design is truly eerie , the creature design is frightening and effective . it 's all so perfect for the dark tone . the musical score by david shire is completely beautiful , in addition , and covers a lot of emotions - the music will bring a tear to your eye , i guarantee it . the acting is also very strong . fairuza baulk makes an excellent dorothy , and at times , seems to channel the innocence of judy garland . the voice actors who provide the character to her new friends -lrb- particularly brian henson as jack pumpkinhead -rrb- are a lot of fun , and jean marsh as mombi is terrifying . there are some problems with the film , though . despite being longer than the 30 's version , it felt like less was accomplished . it does drag , and dorothy and her friends do n't go to many places . it 's a bit too straight forward , and could have used one or two more scenes of the gang getting into various misadventures . also , the sense of dread may be too much for some to handle , and could turn some audiences off . but that being said , if you enjoy dark , brooding fantasies , this is a great film ! i loved it as a kid , and would recommend it to any oz fan ! i give it a 9 out of 10 !		9		1
this starts of with a clichéd attack but moves from there into much more interesting territory . the plot starts off as a serial killer film , angry husbands hunts for his wife 's killer , but then moves into a more unusual revenge film . the acting is excellent ; byung-hun lee has less to do as the dark and mostly silent husband but he is convincing , min-sik choi is superb as the killer , he comes across as creepy and disturbed and his performance carries the film , the other actors all deliver reasonable performances but they have little to do . the violence is shocking in it 's simplicity , although there are a few martial arts scenes and chase scenes most of the violence is simple and direct and fa more convincing for that , and in some ways that directness is more brutal than the torture scenes . there is some comedy , mostly from the meetings with other killers , but this is fundamentally a very dark film . the ending sticks with the uncompromisingly dark theme , no clichés here .		9		1
from the beginning , there are allusions . the retired agents carry their notoriety like a burden , almost sorrowfully . two are divorced and alienated for longer . one arrives unexpectedly , a phantom from their common history , and , almost as swiftly , departs again . mirren boldly shoulders the literal and spiritual wounds and the acidic consequences of actions she 's stifled for over three decades , largely detached , apparently resentful , with a serrated disfigurement on her cheek . answers are given in a story inside the story , an of memory ribbon . this inner chronicle is the pounding nucleus of the movie : the inexperienced agents , plagued by anxiety , determination and enigmatic hungers , scrunched together in a ramshackle apartment . the simmering of hormones is tangible . all the tension and kicks , not to mention the sudden eruptions of violence , have real value and import because we 're afraid for the characters and their fate . their target is rachel 's to visit routinely under the pretext of an ob/gyn patient , an overpoweringly disquieting version of the espionage femme who stakes her body for her motherland . the old man 's tender initiation of every appointment , `` this is my hand , and this is the , '' might finally have deposed the `` is it safe ? '' of another mengele standby as the most unsettling phrase ever spoken by doctor to patient . these agonizing sequences result in a scene just slightly less so , after vogel is taken prisoner and the relationship upturned , rachel practically force-feeding the hostage as he pleads for mercy . in between is a play of nerve-racking power , as the agents attempt to steal vogel past east german security and onto a train . the effect is a self-contained inner potboiler of le tone and concentration . outstanding is chastain , who resumes the summer of her emergence with a performance that authentically weds power and weakness . she and mirren invisibly merge into a single intriguing body of willpower and discomfort . the other illustrious players are their natural charismatic selves , but chastain becomes the livelihood of the events , the most sympathetic personage and the one who reveals the movie 's core . the double story unraveling between 1965 and 1997 , we see that mirren 's rachel is really the outcome of chastain 's . both actresses engrave her with a coordinated translation of a particularly multifarious character . it 's refreshing to watch how smoothly mirren and chastain pass the rachel wand to and fro . worthington , whom hollywood upgraded to leading man long before anyone established if he was a credible actor , submits on-and-off substantiation that he is indeed . prone to vengeance and driven by profound loss , his complicated character illustrates a post-war inner health , a contemplation of the whole idea of justice . and christensen is a gripping monster as vogel , by turns groveling and vile . understated love triangles , duplicity and contradictory dogmas illuminate the action , as does the acute mental affliction that accompanies the burden of a national pursuit of justice on one 's shoulders . in a frame of mind like steven spielberg 's munich , this meticulous drama , far more keen on the fine distinctions of human actions than exploitation or explosives , contemplates the implications of such an insufferably harried assignment , in which failure is a jolt to personal and national dignity . this challenge hinges on the hub of the movie and , before the manufactured conclusion , appears to be its moral scaffold , the very kernel it was fostered from . through the experience that binds the three central characters , we clearly ponder the puzzles and fabrications of political gallantry , especially how history may be twisted , and likewise the unadorned concept of truth . such themes illustrate the murky perils of misinformation , the challenging freedom that lives in coming clean . particularly , all this underscores the meaning of impartiality and ethics . artistically , john madden 's film scarcely disappoints . the pressing plot , compelling performances and abrupt fits of brutality inundate it with an crushing level of suspense . the debt has a far advanced intellect and significantly more meaningful characterizations . many will feel a homecoming to the school of 1970s thrillers such as three days of the condor or marathon man .		9		1
- a - coming into this film , i expected to see a good fight in film that would have good fights and a good story of two brothers . i got that , and then some . this film had drama , fights , and characters who are n't just there to be playing pieces in an arena . the movie is long , but it does it to build up tom hardy and his father nick note who did an excellent job and joel edgerton as who they are and why they are doing this . then the fights kick in and leads to the match of brother vs. brother , a one man wrecking crew against a teacher looking for money . who will come home with the money ?		9		1
i thought that the first movie definitely could 've been as good as ` the incredible hulk ' . but it was n't . although it was entertaining , there should 've been a more interesting plot along with a better cast.the sequel actually got it norton did a better job as the hulk , and liv tyler did a better job as betty is also more action.and no action movie would be perfect without special effects , which in this movie are if you enjoyed the first movie , then i definitely recommend this highly superior you hated the first movie , then i still recommend this movie.if there is any word that sums up this movie , here it is : incredible		9		1
the devil wears prada is the biggest surprise and will be most likely the best comedy of the year . it seems that the film has achieved not only financial success -lrb- over 120 million bucks only in the us -rrb- , but also artistic one , which is extremely rare nowadays . journalism graduate , andrea has just been hired to be a 2nd assistant in a legendary runway magazine devoted to fashion . her psychotic chief , miranda priestly seems to do everything within her power to humiliate and fire andy . the film is not another over-the-top chick flick . in fact , one may even refer to devil wears prada as an intriguing and funny battle of cultures , in which people from different backgrounds and with different priorities participate . the writing always goes in the right directions as choices that screenwriter aline brosh mckenna makes are never wrong . the movie unfolds smoothly and during the 2nd half , director david frankel applies , aside from humour , also some moving scenes as andy has to take important decision . besides , the flick contains loads of unforced , mainly verbal and situational humour , which absolutely can not be classified as stupid . both humour and drama are superbly combined by director who captures losses and sacrifices of workers . the oscar-worthy acting is a real highlight of this pic . spontaneous anne hathaway is at the beginning sweet and later transforms into elegant chick who tries to make ends meet in his private life . as always great meryl streep is simply perfect as a cold editor barking comments with a sense of superiority . what 's more , supportive roles are also outstanding . tucci displays his comedic talent by delivering some smart one-liners . emily blunt is also great in displaying her fear for loony priestly . all in all , skipping devil wears prada is very unwise decision .		9		1
this movie was as surprise from start to finish . i was not highly anticipating a work based on stephen king , and adapted by larry karaszewski , whose dubious `` credits '' seem to lie flat on the page , as well as the screen . king 's works are bastardized enough . i really saw no point to this new exercise in . i can say i am happy a fan brought me a copy of the dvd . i was bowled over . the were quite creative , and the work itself held a great fascination beneath the seeming infectious insanity if a house gone mad . i might find this an opportune time to interject that i may not have bought the execution of this work , without the beautifully tragic performance of john cusak . he was this film 's jack nicholson , and he pulled it off brilliantly . all in all ? stephen king likes a haunted house , and quite frankly , i highly enjoy haunted houses via king . 1408 is like the shining on a steroid overdrive , and i highly recommend it . this is a great friday/saturday night movie . it rates an 8.8 / 10 from ... the fiend : .		9		1
i love this movie ! i have seen it numerous times and it never fails to bring a tear to my eye at the end . there is a central inspiring message in this movie that we can make the world a better place by doing good deeds . even though there is heartbreak and tragedy in life , ultimately we can overcome if we stick together and help each other . i know a lot of cynics will find this all to be a bunch of melodramatic hogwash - but so be it . i choose to believe there is still good in the world - even in the midst of great evil -lrb- i.e. the ending -rrb- . there are phenomenal performances here by kevin spacey , helen hunt and haley joel osment . i especially am blown away by osment 's portrayal . i 'm sad i have n't seen anything noteworthy from him since 2003 in secondhand lions -lrb- although not my favorite of his performances compared to `` pay it forward '' and `` sixth sense '' -rrb- . i do n't want to give away any of the surprise twists - this is a must see movie !		9		1
this is often marketed as a parody to romero 's `` dawn of the dead '' , but it 's so much more than that . the clever writing makes this a movie with many layers . first of all , it 's of course a brilliant pile-up of genre clichés and nods to the source material . it 's been three days since i watched this movie and i 'm still unbelievably amused by `` we 're coming to get you , barbara '' . then , it 's a straight-forward laugh-out-loud comedy . my favourite moment in the entire movie is when they try to kill a couple of zombies by throwing lp 's through their faces . that scene was already in the theatre trailer , so i must have seen it countless times by now , but it still gets me every time . surprisingly , this movie also has some good straight-up horror value . i really did n't expect this to be so gory , the cartoon violence is definitely a plus and fits right in . i also liked how i actually cared about which characters lived and which characters died for a change . that 's pretty rare in recent horror efforts , so it was unexpected to find this quality in of all things , `` shaun of the dead '' . long story short : `` shaun of the dead '' is effing awesome .		9		1
i was eager to view this well-regarded feature via a dvd presentation and see what kind of `` making of ... '' extra would be available . universal did a great job of packaging this quality film ; i have seen many memorable films about the ww ii jewish holocaust but this ranks among the absolute top tier . the details about szpilman 's music and the corroboration about his eyewitness memoir written in the 1950 's helps build the authenticity of this project . the use of locations that were totally wrecked also helps the director 's and screenwriter 's visions to shine through . i am impressed by this young actor 's commitment and his implicit diligence at conveying the talent and intelligence of the polish musician . brody illustrates how `` pretty faces '' are not the only men worth building cinematic casting lists around ; i ca n't imagine brad pitt or ben affleck in such a role that requires intellect and solitary mundane discipline -lrb- his piano technique and artistry -rrb- . kudos to mr. brody - - your academy award is a worthy one to a hard worker ! for those who with little awareness of the situation of the polish people during the nazi regime , this is a great `` intro '' and will display the many-sided nature of people during war time : the good and humane , the selfish , and the victimized people who were vulnerable and too trusting in a compromised `` modern civilization '' like europe in the 1930 's . this film is a 10 * product - - highly to be recommended to the young who will talk over the graphic victimization with understanding mentors and older adults who know about this crucial tragic event in the 20th century that must never be repeated !		9		1
having managed to miss ang lee 's hulk from 5 years ago , i watched this version of stan lee and jack kirby 's green-skinned , monster with an open mind . in a word : awesome ! nice recap of the origin during the opening credits before we find bruce banner -lrb- edward norton -rrb- in brazil having basically stayed calm for at least a year . that wo n't last long . there 's also general ross -lrb- william hurt -rrb- , emil blonsky -lrb- tim roth -rrb- who later becomes the abomination , samuel sterns -lrb- tim blake nelson -rrb- who tries to cure banner , and betty ross -lrb- liv tyler -rrb- - the general 's daughter who stands by bruce through all his trials and tribulations . great mixture of drama , suspense , and action as provided by director louis leterrier . eagle-eyed viewers who 've lived for the last 40 years should have no trouble spotting previous portrayers of banner/hulk : bill bixby in a television scene from his earlier series `` the courtship of eddie 's father '' , and lou ferrigno as a security guard who lets norton in -lrb- he also says something as the hulk in a later scene -rrb- . and of course , stan lee puts in his hitchcockian cameo ! one more person i 'd like to mention is ty of the cancelled show `` back to you '' - playing a shrink who also gets involved with betty . in short , the incredible hulk is another very worthy movie made from a marvel comics character . p.s. my first real encounter with the hulk was from a comic book i got for my 9th birthday that had a 45 record attached from power records that provided the voices of the characters and narration in that book . the abomination was the villain in that one .		9		1
when you watch the cider house rules , you 'll notice something . every emotion that you feel coming from the screen , is genuine . there are no forced feelings in this film . lasse halstrom guides a talented cast through a great script and makes it so easy for us to identify with the characters on the screen . michael caine delivers a great performance and manages to make his role both comical , and tragic . tobey maguire and charlize theron shine as two young people falling in love , and you can tell that there is chemistry between them , and you can feel the pain of what each must do at the end of the film . the film is about finding yourself and realizing that you do n't have to go very far to find out where your family is . the cider house rules slowly creeps up on you and envelops you into a story that is heartwarming , funny , and sad . truly , a great film that will leave you with moist eyes .		9		1
deniro is excellent as jack mabry , a parole officer in charge of dealing with edward norton as a convicted arsonist who thinks setting fire to buildings is `` awesome '' and has a rather skanky girlfriend , well portrayed by milla jovovich here . frances conroy is jack 's washed out wife , they have been married over forty years , jack still watches pro golf on television and attends church . on occasion he goes to the local pastor for question , but does not get the answers he is looking for . he loses his brother early in the story , causing him to re-examine his purpose in life . there are some good undercurrents here about guilt and innocence as well as redemption . in the beginning of the film we see jack with his young wife who threatens to leave him , so he holds their child out the window threatening to drop her if the wife leaves . therein we see a glimpse of jack 's character that is not wholly revealed in the film 's narrative . jack is missing passion and stimulation . he is losing his faith . in a way , his allegiance to the prison system reflects that , without working in this very structured environment he would indeed lose his moral compass completely and perhaps `` go the other way '' to the other side of the law . the gray area of `` no one is ever completely infallible or innocent '' is a nuanced theme here . watch the film more than once , it is a good story of character , and what makes people tick , which is n't always an easy answer . deniro is very good in this performance . 9/10 .		9		1
does it even need to be said that the godfather is an amazing film ? is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful ? everybody knows . everybody will always know . this is a film which will live forever . the story , the performances , the cinematography , the music ... all so perfect . and all woven together so wonderfully by director francis ford coppola who created a true classic . there are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly . no matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact . even if you 've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience . from the famous opening scene with marlon brando 's don vito corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter 's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up . it 's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise . because initially it seems obvious that the story is about don vito corleone . he is the godfather after all . but , for as powerful a presence as brando is , as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of don vito 's son michael , as played so wonderfully by al pacino . when michael comes into his own the film , gripping from the start , becomes even more compelling . has any character in any film evolved more than michael corleone does here ? the michael we meet at his sister 's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end . and what a performance by pacino , changing along with his character . what a journey it is for michael as his story unfolds . and it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it . brando and pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of james caan , robert duvall , diane keaton and al lettieri . and that is just scratching the surface . there are so many memorable characters . and what a world coppola has created for these characters to inhabit . the film has a unique look and feel to it . the world of the godfather is quite unlike any other , often imitated but never duplicated . it 's a triumph in every sense for coppola . but perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the corleones . we know right from the start that don vito corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things . but we identify with him anyway . and one can not help but feel for michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business . everyone has their favorite godfather characters , favorite moments , favorite lines . the film has become a cultural touchstone . and as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film , if possible , actually continues to grow in stature . it is a classic film which stands the test of time . the godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film . a true masterpiece .		9		1
this is one of the funniest movies ever made . not only for the humor of leslie nielsen , but seeing beaver 's mom speak in jive . there is so much to see you ca n't take it all in in one sitting . literally a laugh every few seconds .		9		1
in a not too distant future , an astronaut -lrb- sam rockwell -rrb- lives in isolation for three years in a mining of the moon . when his contract is about to expire , he discovers a terrible secret that concerns you . `` moon '' has everything you like to see in the cinema : an excellent script and a splendid interpretation . one does not notice at first , but then realizes that this is a film supported by a single actor : sam rockwell . few films have been sustained by a single actor . it has the intimate warmth of ray bradbury 's stories and the environment '' 2001 : a space odyssey '' 1968 . it is an intimate , existential and transcendental film that tells the weaknesses of human beings in the vastness of the cosmos and as a metaphor for daily life . you realize how small it is . this void in the family and personal environment brings out the protagonist his paranoia and insecurities , adding that economic interests at any cost is shipped the despotic company , right behind the astronaut . as a good `` guinea pig '' , sam rockwell discovers a secret network of the company was to plan b , if something went wrong . and also , in that plot twist , is where the film gains more strength . `` moon '' is a science fiction film moving , leaving the footprint and induces a pleasant reflection and melancholy . it is a story of loneliness and survival , of friendship , profound ode to freedom and life . the interpretation of sam rockwell is exceptional , fascinating perspectives addressing . his adventures in space are fresh , vital , amazing . his irreverent and aggressive point sweetens the excessive rigidity of the environment .		9		1
with western influences seeping into so many quentin tarantino films -lrb- such as kill bill and inglourious basterds -rrb- , an actual western film by tarantino is a dream come true . styles and sensibilities align in a sublime manner , resulting in what must be one of the most unique and refreshingly entertaining films in the genre . django unchained has everything that makes a tarantino so great : style , sharp dialogue , an attentive production , poignant violence , unpredictable plotting , and vengeful characters we can root for . the film has several major and duels , which are quite thrilling , and extremely bloody . the violence here is on the same level as a paul verhoeven film , for it is explosively bloody and pulpy , and it never shies away from showing the painful consequences of such violence . there are also a few brutal scenes that can be pretty hard to watch . when the bullets are n't flying , however , the film maintains a lot of interest with its purposeful dialogue and pacing , and with its plot building . i feel the film slowed down and lost some of its vibe quite a bit in the middle , but most everything else is fantastically entertaining . the plot is what makes the film work , more than the action . it 's somewhat divided into several episodes of sorts , but they all build up a central revenge-driven conflict , and it all reaches a satisfying climax . the plot twists and turns in very wild and interesting directions , and always with vigilant attention to the characters . django himself is a character we ca n't help but to root for , while dr. schultz is a character too interesting to dismiss . most everybody else are bad guys we love to hate . beneath nearly every scene is a poignant undercurrent of racism , a theme which drives all of the characters and the story . do be warned that such themes have not sat well with many audience members , especially with the film 's language . as expected , this film has a ton of style . you can certainly expect quality photography and sharp editing . acting is very good : jamie foxx does his best to make the title character iconic , while christoph waltz and leo dicaprio both liven things up a lot and try to steal each scene . samuel l. jackson is as grumpy as ever , and it was a joy to watch kerry washington . writing is superb ; tarantino continues to show incredible skill as wielding dialogue and language of given eras and cultures for entertaining effect . this production has good-looking sets , props , and costumes , but i did feel that a few things looked a little too modern or out-of-place in a western . as with most of his other films , tarantino manipulates music in the film impeccably . the violence and racist issues have caused some controversy , but django unchained is a brilliant marriage of tarantino 's beloved style and tarantino 's beloved genre . westerns are n't even my thing , but is exciting enough and has enough style and substance to make me call it a favorite . 4.5 / 5 -lrb- entertainment : good | story : very good | film : very good -rrb-		9		1
though i felt that the ` tragedy ' aspects of the story good have been improved , this is a vastly entertaining and perfectly paced suspense thriller . joseph cotten gives a perfect performance , it 's amazing how we feel sympathy for both him -lrb- the murderer -rrb- and his daughter who is in danger from him . one good thriller . 9 out of 10 .		9		1
although this is the third film starring peter sellers as inspector -lrb- `` a shot in the dark '' being the second one -rrb- , it is only the second movie revolving around the pink panther diamond . i give this third best in the series , behind `` the pink panther strikes again '' and `` a shot in the dark . '' `` the return of the pink panther '' certain had plenty of potential and could have been the best pink panther movie . however , this film has a certain sense of cruel humor that brings down the overall quality just slightly . for example , christopher plummer 's rather mean character , always breaking the fingers of his assistant , as well as chief dreyfuss actually choking a man to death , come off as unappealing and make the film a bit less funny . nevertheless , closeau is hysterical in this film , from his first scene in which he tries to talk with a blind man and his monkey ; hilarious . this is also the second panther film with closeau 's assistant cato , a martial-arts fighter who tests closeau by hiding in his apartment and attacking him . from cato 's first scene to the last one , the brilliant twist in the restaurant , he provides possible the most hysterical aspect of the film . this is a must-see for fans of this series and great comedy alike . though the next film -lrb- `` pink panther strikes again '' -rrb- works a bit better and provides more laughs overall , this is very worthwhile . could have been the funniest in the series . *** 1/2 out of ****		9		1
great movie , and a politically apt message . it seems that creativity and true freedom to have an individual `` voice '' have been restricted quite a bit in the last 25 years . this movie shows us how costly standing up for one 's values in the face of public pressure can be . it also shows us some of the rewards possible with such integrity . the movie names democrats and republicans as such , within the fictional world of the story . no generic or safe amorphous political figures , unidentifiable and therefore inoffensive to all . that is rare in movies , and exciting in a sneaky kind of way . no big fuss is made over it , but as an audience member you later realize how cool that is . no `` 555 '' personas here ! that 's a quiet victory , perhaps , but i was nonetheless impressed -lrb- later -rrb- with how much courage that took . so yaay ! to the writer/director lurie . the cast was also great . i had never heard of joan allen -- until i read a profile of her in the ny times . turns out i had seen her several times before , and had enjoyed and admired her talent quite a bit . but like another great actor , robert duvall , joan allen seems to disappear so completely in a role that she may be somewhat `` invisible '' as an actor . that 's a blessing , and the highest compliment . but it also might be frustrating for her and her fans , at times , would n't you think ? the very thing that makes her so great as an actor is the same thing that might make it hard to remember her outside of the role she played . jeff bridges is fantastic , as usual . gary oldman is another actor with a two-edged sword thing going . he always seems to play creeps and villains . he is such a good actor that he seems creepy himself , because we do n't get to see a better side of him . overall , this is a great movie . oh -- one flaw : what 's with all the focus on chewing and eating ? where did modern movie makers get the idea that people talking with a mouth full of food is somehow `` '' or grittier or whatever the quality ? there were moments when the key characters were shown shoveling piles food into their mouths , while still talking a mile a minute . this movie was n't as bad as the recent `` random hearts '' -lrb- i still shudder when i recall harrison ford chewing ... and chewing ... and chewing for what seemed like two hours -rrb- . all that gulping , smacking , and gasping , especially while talking , is such a turnoff . for me , it 's like fingernails on a blackboard . please stop ! congrats on `` the contender '' -- hope lots of people see it !		9		1
this one is totally out of left field for director david lynch of `` blue velvet '' fame . nothing is weird this time , no midgets or strange dream sequences , just a straight forward story of a man who decides to ride a lawn tractor from iowa to wisconsin to visit his terminally ill brother . richard farnsworth is magnificent as the old man who has lost his drivers license due to poor eyesight . he rides his john deere in what is one of the most interesting road movies i 've ever seen . sissy spacek is the old man 's daughter and lynch just lets her act , and she is great , as always . the trip is heartwarming and a very different entry from david lynch .		9		1
not since `` se7en '' has a film come along that i can remember being so disturbing . right from the opening sequence , director mark pellington pulls you in and does n't let you relax for the entire running time . the cast is superb , bar none . standouts being robbins and cusack as the neighbours . particularly cusack , never have i seen a smile and outwardly sunny personality presented so chillingly . it 's a compliment to her as an actress that she 's good for a few scares even when nothing else is happening on screen . robbins is cast against type as the villain . please , hollywood , do this more often ! he too shines in the role . -lrb- spoilers from hereon . -rrb- the film does a good job of allowing us to relate to all of the characters , even the langs are never passed off as one dimensional villains who do n't have a life . indeed , part of the film 's chilling realism is in showing us that people like these do behave normally , they just happen to hold and propagate some very extreme and unpalatable views . as a result of the fact that we grow to like michael farraday 's character , scenes that could and perhaps did slip into formula still work , retaining the edgy feel that 's present throughout the film . in particular here i 'm talking about farraday being ` discovered ' numerous times as he searches for more information . bridges also deserves credit for portraying realistic paranoia without slipping into histrionics . yes , the ending is somewhat implausible , asking us to take for granted too many coincidences , but i 've let that slide , because to be honest i was that impressed with the movie that this flaw only became apparent after reading some of the comments posted on here . also , credit to the filmmakers for not copping out with the ending and showing us that , even though we may not like it , the bad guys do win sometimes . i do n't buy the ` movies are meant to be for escapism ' argument , because some movies are , but no-one in their right mind would watch `` arlington road '' as an escapist fantasy . this movie deals with reality all the way . my jaw was also on the floor at the ending , and i turned to my uncle and said in disbelief `` they ca n't do that !

nominated , best picture , 1956 . no other movie has ever shown the plight of troubled teenagers than `` rebel without a cause '' . the petty fights , the bullying , revenge , the desire to do something unprecedented so as to be noticed in the crowd , the precociousness , the gradually dwindling bond with family members - all these are the facets one faces when a transition from an innocent adolescent to a is made . jim stark does n't share a very good relationship with his cantankerous mother and is more attached to his father , who supports him and deals with his mother 's tantrums calmly . the quarrels between his mother and father make him feel insecure and he vents his pent up emotions by indulging in activities like breaking the parking lights or bashing his fellow students in the school . he gets into a fight with a gang in his new school and is challenged to a drag race , to prove that he is a `` chicken '' . the race ends with the death of the challenger and the other members of the gang hunt jim . jim falls in love with judy and together they care for the troubled and insecure plato . the movie ends with the tragic death of plato . a 24-year old dean matched the standards of method-acting set by marlon brando , and with this performance he justifies the legendary status conferred on him .		9		1
director danny boyle is known for his stylish films in trainspotting and 28 days later . while the latter talks about the evil of drugs , millions talks about the root of all evil - money . lots of it . to be exact , close to 300 british pounds . this film is about taking and using money that is not yours , the morality behind that issue , and the exploration if sudden wealth can change a person 's attitude . it also looks at spending large amounts of money -lrb- and the difficulty thereof -rrb- in a short span of time , as this film is set against a backdrop of the british pound no longer being legal tender after 7 days , given the british 's decision to use the . damian cunningham is a young boy who 's missing his mother , who just passed away , and whom we do n't get to see until the end of the film -lrb- in a very touching scene -rrb- . he has been living in his own imaginary world since , reading about and dreaming about talking to saints , asking them if they had met or known about his mom in heaven . many times , we look at this world through the eyes of this innocent boy , especially when the huge sack of money literally fell onto him , and he thinks that it is a gift from god as compensation for taking his mom . and that 's when the story picks up . his brother anthony suggested they keep quiet about the finding - reason being the government will tax most of it away , and while anthony decides to ham it up , using the money to buy friends and cronies , damian developed a want to help the poor - from people in the street , to mormons -lrb- the punching bag for some major gags in the film , and the hypocrisy of it all -rrb- , to africans in need of food , water and shelter , and absolute strangers , which is of course , dangerous when the `` real owner '' of the bag of money come knocking at the door . given the dilemma of spending , how do you want to do it ? invest in real estate ? foreign exchange ? -lrb- the savvy anthony came up with those suggestions , and seeing it on screen is hilarious -rrb- . save it in a bank ? and given your want to help others , how do you do so without endangering yourself , which damian however , when you realise that the money is not , but robbed while en route to the incinerator -lrb- one of the many interesting scenes in this film is the heist -rrb- , what do you do next ? do you continue spending it ? or give it up ? do you spend the money as a form of compensation for your house getting ransacked by burglars looking for the loot ? damian cunningham is played by alexander etel , and you ca n't help think he 's the british 's answer to mccauley culkin at his age . he brings forth pure innocence as damian , and is absolutely hilarious in his dealings with his imaginary saints -lrb- complete with halos -rrb- . and the saints go marching on - the highlight of which is st peter . listen carefully to the dialogue , as he makes subtle digs into parables and the truth behind a certain miracle - i cracked up at that one . this film is n't complete without the complementary baddie and the uptight community policeman , and also gives the term social engineering a whole new perspective -lrb- even practised by the young ! -rrb- . with danny boyle 's stylistic editing and beautiful shots of transitions and imaginary situations to complement the social commentary , this could probably be in contention as one of the best films of 2005 .		9		1
i am legend is a brilliant movie with an incredible story line , a great cast and smiths performance in this movie was amazing , he was completely in to his character from start to finish , and hes the main reason this movie is so great , because hes such a good actor.the movie is rated pg-13 but i would say if your a parent thinking about letting your young son or daughter watch this , do n't , there are some very creepy seens that have a very real feel to it , that a young kid would be sensitive to . robert neville -lrb- will smith -rrb- struggles to find a cure for a plague that killed most of the world and turned the rest in to horrible mutants , it is just him left alone , with his dog sam in new york city .		9		1
i 'm not really a fan of zombie films but it recently seems like they 've kinda ganged up on me . shaun of the dead is therefore a nice breath of fresh air in a genre that has become quite repetitive and self-referencing . what the film does is combine light-hearted comedy but is also a good zombie-film on the side . the film 's definite high-points are its depiction of how people deal with a problem of such a bizarre nature . the human drama in all its cheesiness provides the perfect outlet for the films dark comedy which in turn keeps the film from becoming too serious even during more emotional moments -lrb- such as philip and mom 's deaths -rrb- . the film also does n't fail to see to the needs of zombie fans and actually contains quite a bit of gore . though it is rather bleak and gory a film , deep down it is actually a romantic comedy . shaun of the dead is the quintessential date movie ...		9		1
firstly , there was hardly any way i would n't have liked this film . i love zombie movies . i love gore . the only problem with this movie i had was that it could have used more gore and cannibalism . but then again , i 'm a zombie , shall we say , connoisseur , and i expect a lot of gore . this movie follows ecstatically the road well paved by george romero and peter jackson 's `` dead '' -lrb- night of the living , dawn of , day of -rrb- and dead-alive respectively . plus , with commercial approval from george romero , peter jackson , and sam raimi , hell , how could you go wrong ?? i would 've wasted money on alien vs. predator if those three had approved of it publicly -lrb- although i would have to question their sanity -rrb- . while there was n't enough gore for me , there seemed to be plenty for the average movie-goer judging from the reaction of the audience around me . but again , i enjoy zombie -lrb- zombi 2 in italia -rrb- , dawn of the dead -lrb- both versions -rrb- , day of the dead , and dead-alive -- and good luck topping the gore of those films and getting away with an r rating . but to all you zombie fans , you will , as can be expected , enjoy noticing several obvious -lrb- and not-so-obvious -rrb- references to past zombie works -- mostly romero 's masterpieces . right down to individual character lines to tiny portions of music . it 's also a great movie for a first date with a ditz girl . no really . it is . she 'll be all over you afterwards . -lrb- sucker !! -rrb- www.residenthazard.com		9		1
almost famous is the movie cameron crowe has been waiting a lifetime to tell . the fictionalization of crowe 's days as a teenage reporter for creem and rolling stone has all the well-written characters and wonderful `` movie moments '' that we expect from crowe -lrb- jerry maguire -rrb- , but the film has an intangible something extra -- an insider 's touch that will turn the film into the ode to '70s rock & roll for years to come . we are introduced to crowe 's alter ego , william miller -lrb- patrick fugit -rrb- , at home , where his progressive mom -lrb- frances mcdormand , just superb -rrb- has outlawed rock music and sister anita -lrb- zooey deschanel -rrb- has slipped him lps that will `` set his mind free . '' following the wisdom of creem 's disheveled editor , lester bangs -lrb- philip seymour hoffman in an instant-classic performance -rrb- , miller gets on the inside with the up-and-coming band stillwater -lrb- a fictionalized mixture of the allman brothers , led zeppelin , and others -rrb- . a simple visit with the band turns into a three-week , life-altering odyssey into the heyday of american rock . of the characters he meets on the road , the two most important are groupie extraordinary penny lane -lrb- kate hudson in a star-making performance -rrb- and stillwater 's enigmatic lead guitarist -lrb- billy crudup -rrb- , who keeps stringing miller along for an interview . from the handwritten credits -lrb- done by crowe -rrb- to the bittersweet finale , crowe 's comedic valentine is an indelible , heartbreaking romance of music , women , and the privilege of youth .		9		1
its funny how things work out . i 've posted comments about a few steven seagal movies recently . in fact , the last one was about ` hard to kill ' , and at one point i mentioned that i should check out ` under siege ' again . lo and behold , what was on tv later that day but ` under siege ' , in all its glory . ` under siege ' was one of my favourite movies when i was a kid , now i think its seagal 's best movie , and still one of the best action movies around . seagal plays casey ryback , a navy cook serving on-board the uss missouri . he is liked by the captain , but prone to striking other officers . only the captain knows that ryback is an ex-seal , and when the missouri is taken over by terrorists , only ryback can stop the bad-guys and save the crew . ` under siege ' is , at it 's core , a ` die hard ' clone on a ship . its not as good as ` die hard ' , but its still a classic action movie . ryback is a great action hero : cool , collected , funny , and kicks plenty of butt . tommy lee jones plays an awesome villain as william stranix , an ex-cia agent and now terrorist . stranix is easily one of my favourite movie villain . apart from ryback and stranix , there is almost no character development . the rest of the characters are just there , and some may have completely personality changes at random . hey , its an action flick . the action scenes are exciting . there may be as many fighting scenes as there are in other seagal movie , but seagal is always keeping the action going , whether it by rescuing people , shooting people , sneaking around , or blowing things up . awesome . ` under siege ' is a great action movie - 9/10		9		1
i finally got around to see this french production of a modern silent movie . it 's a visual treat of old-fashioned , black and white cinematography in a picture perfect hollywood setting . there , we see an aging , douglas fairbanks look-alike star , george valentin -lrb- jean dujardin -rrb- who is unable to transition from the silent era to talkies after 1930 and who gradually fades from the scene , literally and figuratively . on the way down and out , he meets an aspiring , vivacious young actress , peppy miller -lrb- berenice bejo -rrb- who makes it big , especially when the industry moves to sound . the fairly conventional plot then takes the viewer for a ride through the ups , according to peppy , and downs , according to george , of tinsel town . along the way , we are hugely entertained by an oscar worthy dog -lrb- george 's constant companion -rrb- , extravagant costuming , great music to accompany the silent movie , a bevy of well-known hollywood actors , excellent acting and proof , once again , that a movie is always visual art , first and foremost . jean dujardin is superb - a perfect portrayal of a silent screen star . he 's so good , it defies adequate description . his co-star , berenice bejo matches his performance , but is always overshadowed when together -- except perhaps in the dancing scenes . there 's a good balance between comedy and melodrama , with most of the former provided by uggie , the dog . blending it all together under the direction by michel hazanavicius , the result is a cinematic experience that will probably never be repeated equally well , if at all . sure , the story is ordinary , but structure , montage and mise-en-scene make this movie extraordinary -- almost to the point that one feels transported back in time . that 's entertainment , folks , and not to be missed , even if you 've never seen a silent movie . no movie is perfect , but this one deserves nine out of ten . recommended for all . february 12 , 2013		9		1
one of my favorite techniques in the film is shyamalan 's use of color contrast , that is very unique to how most directors use it . he uses vibrant colors -lrb- orange , red , purple -rrb- to highlight the antagonist -lrb- s -rrb- and uses very dull colors -lrb- green , brown , black -rrb- to blend the protagonist into the background . it helps to display the films overall theme of someone completely ordinary having the abilities of someone extraordinary . the cinematography itself is very fresh and original . seeing willis ' conversation on the train through the point of view of the girl sitting in front of him was a great technique . i also liked seeing the scene between young elijah and his mother reflected off of the television screen . another unique strategy used by shyamalan . the performances are some of the best work done by the actors involved . willis is very subtle and flawlessly melancholy in what i firmly believe is his greatest performance . jackson is , like the theme of the film , on the other side of the spectrum . vibrant and extravagant , using great vocal power in everything he says . the film is just full of these contrasts between willis and jackson which shyamalan uses brilliantly . the twist itself is one of the best i 've ever seen . it 's subtle and extremely unpredictable . also , the fact that the entire film is n't based on this twist -lrb- unlike the sixth sense -rrb- makes it that much less predictable .		9		1
i ca n't really call this a sequel to the first star trek film of ' 79 , more like a restart , with this forming the 1st part of an informal trilogy culminating with the 4th film . this is actually a sequel to the original series episode `` space seed , '' featuring the return of khan , kirk 's best villain . contrary to the previous film , where the filmmakers did everything they could to distance themselves from the original show , here they did a complete turnabout : picking a specific episode to base the new film on . they also followed the excellent pacing and action aspects of the best episodes ; this film moves , the equivalent of a great page-turner of a novel . it 's about a dozen years after the end of the 1st film and 15 years after kirk had marooned khan and his 70 followers on a primitive planet . kirk has many regrets by the time this film is over . he and all his usual top officers -lrb- except chekov -rrb- accompany a bunch of young cadets on a routine training mission aboard the aging enterprise . chekov , meanwhile , is now 1st officer aboard the starship reliant ; he and his captain make the mistake of beaming down , unknowingly , to khan 's home planet . only about 20 of these genetically-enhanced supermen are left , but it 's enough for them to take over the reliant . and that 's how a rip-roaring space epic of revenge and rebirth takes off . credit must go to director meyer and producer bennett for taking the best elements of the original series , grafting on some potent themes to reflect the passage of a decade or two , and fusing these into a thoroughly exciting adventure . it 's adventure on the high seas , transplanted to outer space . kirk begins to feel old age creeping up on him here and his lack of active field duty shows when he gets caught off-guard by khan , resulting in some dreadful damage to our beloved starship . but , like two old warhorses who do n't know when to quit , he and the enterprise soldier on . meyer lent a decidedly militaristic flavor to starfleet here , a reversal on the laid back atmosphere of the 1st film -lrb- maybe , after the threat of v ` ger , starfleet went all military -rrb- . it 's appropriate , as we have some lengthy battles in outer space in this one , more so than most episodes or the other films . shatner does a terrific job of capturing some of kirk 's finest moments here , a middle-aged but still formidable captain -lrb- well , technically , he 's an admiral now -rrb- . spock appears to have embraced the human half of his template , almost mocking the logical side of his character at times . kelley as mccoy gets some of the best lines , as usual , and delivers them with old-style panache . and then we have montalban as khan . if you plug in a fantastic villain such as this into a movie and then have the actor exceed expectations , the job 's pretty much half done already - you 've got the makings of a great story . khan seethes with mania and superhuman determination , and montalban electrifies the screen , much as he did in the original episode . meyer was fond of having him quote passages from melville 's `` moby dick '' and here it works beautifully , right to the bitter end . some of the scenes , as a result of all this , make a very strong impression - a grandly tragic epic feel ; check out the one where khan orders kirk 's death and the immediate aftermath . it 's an instant classic and simply unforgettable . this also benefited from the screen debut of actress alley , who brings an exotic flavor to her part . this is n't perfect : the other regulars , except koenig , are given short shrift , due to so many new characters . beside the ones mentioned , there 's also kirk 's old flame and his son , as well as another captain . on a larger scale , this kind of plot regrettably established a pattern that removed any possibility of returning to the theme of exploration , the key to the original series . instead , it 's caught up with the more mundane human trademarks of intrigue , chases & battles , and some politics , a trend to continue in most of the films . although , there is the introduction of an incredible new technology , the genesis effect , and a rather shocking climax for the trek fans . they got pretty much everything right here ; this one would be hard to beat . followed directly by `` the search for spock .

`` it 's christmas and the kid 's getting ' his f **** g ' present . '' i 'm not a big lover of christmas movies and american comedies do n't fall high on my list of favourite movie genre 's either , so by rights , bad santa should not have done much for me . wrong ! i loved it . bad santa is a fantastic comedy that had me laughing out loud several times . billy bob thornton is not the most obvious choice for a santa who drink and swears too much but he takes to the role perfectly . his dwarf friend played by tony cox gets nearly all the funny lines and the two actors work together brilliantly . bernie mac is funny -lrb- especially the eating the orange scene -rrb- and the kid -lrb- bret kelly -rrb- is great . it 's not often comedy films have as many funny scenes as bad santa does and director terry zwigoff deserved a great deal of credit by getting billy bob thornton to produce he 's defining movie performance . bad santa is without doubt , up there as one of my favourite christmas movies of all time . if you have not seen this before you must . just do n't show it to the kids !		9		1
`` dead man walking '' 's excellence comes from two amazing performances by susan sarandon and sean penn. . i 've only seen either thespian in a couple of movies , and this is by far their best work . sarandon is passionate and subtle as sister helen prejean and sean penn is larger-than-life as the death row inmate matt poncelet . both have great chemistry and deliver some captivating scenes that i have not seen since the works of foster and hopkins in `` silence of the lambs '' . to my surprise , tim robbins was the director . i do n't know what else he 's directed , but he needs to do it more often . he not only captures the film , but puts the audience in with what the characters feel . however , the downside to this film is the music . it does not fit with the feeling of the movie , in fact , it disrupts some scenes . for instance , the movie starts with a sound of blue grass , but the finale ends with a soloist arab . what the heck ? two totally different types of music , which do n't fit the plot ? it does n't make any sense to me . despite these poor choices of music , `` dead man walking '' is an excellent , powerful film . 9/10		9		1
i did n't see this film until it came out on dvd . while i certainly would have preferred to see it on the big screen the dvd version is worth buying -- even if you have already seen the film . there are so many extra tracks that explain just how the effects were handled that it is really worth it . the technical aspects alone astounded me . the one dimensionality of the characters when they are in black and white is the major impetus of the story . once they are able to `` think outside the box '' they become vibrant and truly alive -- and coincidentally in color . i saw this with a friend of mine from great britain that had not been exposed to the sitcoms of the 1950 's american television . i had to explain to him that the people really were like that . that june cleaver did wear pearls to vacuum the living room ; and that a toilet did not make an appearance on television until sometime in the mid-60 's ; and that every married couple really did always sleep in twin beds . this is a movie not to be missed .		9		1
though we had a plethora of films about troops returning from the vietnam war and trying to re-integrate back into their societies , most of which were hard-hitting , angry voices against war , here is arguably the original - and best . definitely a family orientated movie -lrb- cert u -rrb- this will appeal to and find favour with all ages , but do n't start thinking that this is all gooey , slushy nonsense . there 's some quite hard-hitting topics covered , even by today 's standards and of course , with our minds on our current troops in iraq/afghanistan , equally relevant . , which each of the three g.i. 's immediate and extended families and friends being examined , it 's about them coping , with varying degrees of success , with home life and getting jobs , now that the war is ended . it 's the little observations and stories around them that are so fascinating , as the heroes of yesterday are now anything but when it comes finding new purpose in a changed world . the cast is exemplary , not necessarily the biggest stars of the day but the most believable and natural for their roles . dana andrews , myrna loy and fredric marsh are the ones most easily recognisable and their appearances convey a sort of reassuring familiarity and normality . they 're all excellent , of course . though long , at nearly 3 hours , william wyler 's easy going but assured and tight direction keeps things flowing nicely and it never drags . this , my second viewing , is an enjoyable one as the first and if anything i 'm more at ease with it . though obviously not as exciting or dramatic as other ` normal ' war films , it 's a tragedy that it 's not more well known . i 've never seen it to ever have been on tv , or to my recollection , even sky movies , for that matter . any movie that won 7 oscars and is currently no. 180 in the top 250 imdb 's films of all time , voted by its voters -lrb- us , the public -rrb- is hardly one of minority interest . a friend i lent my dvd to watched it with his family and normally they only go for current films , or ones they know , but they not only enjoyed it , but felt enormously moved by it , too . if you have n't seen the best years ... yet , make a mental note to do so . your life wo n't change by doing so , but it really is worth the 3 hours of it that it will take . you certainly ca n't say the same about every film out there ...		9		1
an utterly sweet , inventive and charming film that examines our love affair with the movies and our need to escape into fantasy . the central device of the wall breaking down between the characters in a film and those watching is great fun , and both mia farrow and jeff daniels do some of their very best work in this . that said , for me , it lacks a little of the depth and complexity of my very favorite allen 's film . it 's a little too cute and simplistic in the middle , but the first and last third , and the uncompromised ending are terrific . it does n't quite hold up -lrb- for me -rrb- on multiple viewings the way ` annie hall ' , or ` crimes and misdemeanors ' or ` hannah and her sisters ' or ` zelig ' do . but even 2nd tier woody allen is better than almost anything else out there . and on a certain level , with great filmmakers its about personal taste , not right and wrong . -lrb- is 's ` modern times ' better than ` city lights ' ? -rrb- so , if you like allen 's work at all and you 've never seen this , you owe yourself a look to decide for yourself .		9		1
michael haneke 's palme d'or winning the white ribbon is one of the great foreign language films of 2009 . shot in color but was desaturated to black-and-white during post-production , the film is very much the quintessential art film -- slowly-paced , beautifully-shot , and thought-provoking . it is an admirable effort by the much respected director of funny games -lrb- 1997 -rrb- , the piano teacher -lrb- 2001 -rrb- , and cache -lrb- 2005 -rrb- . haneke 's intense interest in exploring the human condition , especially of its evil nature , in many of his films highlights his bleak view of humanity . in the white ribbon , it is no different . very much a mystery-drama , haneke 's film is set during the days before the start of wwi in a small , picturesque german village that appears ordinary at first glance but is actually sinister within . narrated by an old schoolteacher whom we do n't see -lrb- we only see his young self -rrb- , the film recalls the strange incidents that took place in this village back when he was young and still teaching there . the entire film is a record of what happened , and in black-and-white , it looks like a historical record . many mistake this as a true story . it is not , but it could pave the way for us to understand how fascism rose to be a tyrannical force in europe in the late 1930s . haneke only presents a factual account of these strange incidents , which are mostly deliberate acts of torture and violence . he does n't give clues as to who the culprit is . the genius of haneke is that all his characters -lrb- even supporting ones -rrb- are developed in such a way that invites both trust and suspicion . even though the villagers and the rich baron 's family form a close-knit community , there seems to be a cloud of mutual distrust . even the children are curiously distanced from their authoritative parents . christian berger 's cinematography is hauntingly beautiful , and when accompanied by spells of silence -lrb- the film has no music score -rrb- that are interwoven with dialogue and ambient sounds , it becomes at times mystifying . haneke 's masterful grasp of editing and camera placement produce some very eerie moments such as a sequence shot in the dark showing a toddler at home trying to find his sister in the middle of the night , a prelude to a psychologically disturbing event that reveals a darker face of one of the film 's key characters . the performances in the film are uniformly excellent , with special mention going to leonie benesch , who plays eva , a shy and sweet village girl whom the schoolteacher falls in love with . haneke 's handling of the numerous child actors is also remarkable not only because some of them are made to undergo a quite grueling experience , but also of the serious subject matter of the film , which straddles into adult territory . in the mould of the traditional whodunit , the white ribbon offers plenty of mystery and the requisite suspense -lrb- in the sense -rrb- . however , as any haneke film would attest , it leaves us with no sense of closure and forces the viewer to react intellectually . in the white ribbon , haneke has collectively and succinctly addressed issues of racism , class struggle , authoritarianism , sexual abuse , infidelity , incest , and violence , providing a foreshadowing of the evil that would come two decades later . while there is far from any causal link between the events that happened in this quiet village to hitler 's rise to power in europe , haneke 's disconcerting portrait of a community whose children are raised in an uncomforting environment of hate and discrimination provides us with an understanding of how the seed of evil can easily take root in the most innocent of beings . recommended ! score : 9/10 -lrb- www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com -rrb- all rights reserved !		9		1
the best since `` the shining '' ? just might be . i read that this is the only selection that stephen king has re-read that scared him . watching the film , i can see why . it is a horror story that makes your blood run cold . samuel l. jackson 's part is small but effective . he has that air of respectability and the demeanor of a guy who sits in a large expensively furnished office of a major hotel and perhaps , might have a fondness for sending postcards . jackson was a nice touch . cusack 's character is believable , likable , and of course , stubborn as a donkey . the third trait gets his rear end into serious trouble . we can all exhibit that sort of at times and knowing when to listen to someone can be the best way to prevent disaster . if he had this knowledge , there would be no story . and everyone loves a good story . i 'm also looking forward to `` the mist '' and `` pet sematary '' . king 's bucks just keep rolling in and i ca n't say he does n't earn them .		9		1
it is a movie that highlights the warmth of a mother 's heart and hug . a movie that keeps one question coming up constantly on your mind : why should we deal with so much pains ? this movie is full with emotions that your heart is going to welcome deeply and embrace them with pain . the main character is susan sarandon for no other character in the movie was capable of approaching her brilliance and performance . through susan 's character we see a woman who is still in love with her husband , has to accept a new woman in his life and this same woman is competing with her on the love of her children . not only that , she later discovers that she has cancer ! then , all the emotions of love , loss , death expectations and friendship , rise to the top and stir your feelings crazily . there are two particular scenes in the movie that are brilliantly directed by chirs columbus and performed by sarandon : 1 -rrb- the scene when sarandon wakes up her daughter and gives her a ride on the horse -lrb- brilliant acting and beautiful music -rrb- 2 -rrb- the scene when sarandon watches her children starting to love julia roberts and she plays feelings of contradiction in her eyes where she is jealous and at the same time they must have a replacement after she goes . this scene shows the great performer susan sarandon is . it is a very deep story that anyone who did n't like has really missed its meanings .		9		1
pop quiz , hot-shot - what 's the most exciting action movie you 've ever seen with a bus in it ? right , the answer is `` speed '' and if you 've seen it then you 'll have to agree that there is more action in this one movie than any ten generic action flicks that have been released in the last ten years . a trend-setter the likes of `` die hard '' , `` raiders of the lost ark '' and `` lethal weapon '' , `` speed '' 's premise is simple - a bus is wired by a madman -lrb- dennis hopper -rrb- to blow up if it drops below 50 mph . this is to give the cop -lrb- keanu reeves -rrb- who ruined his last effort a run for his money in trying to save the day . in the ensuing efforts , a woman -lrb- sandra bullock -rrb- is recruited to drive the bus and keep it over 50 mph at all times . and for as deceivingly simple as it is , `` speed '' pulls out all the stops by making every scene a nail-biter -lrb- the bomb discovery , keanu getting aboard the bus , sandra driving over an incomplete gap in a highway , etc. - the list is endless -rrb- and all the main characters -lrb- and a few of the supporting ones -rrb- are about as smart as your average movie-goer and have enough of these kinds of movies to figure out what the other guy 's move will be and act on it . i loooove movies like that . keanu is far more heroic in this movie than he has been before -lrb- and since -rrb- ; jeff daniels is born to play best pal and does so with ; sandra is a delight to watch as well as hear - she has a voice you literally can wrap yourself up in ; hopper adds to his nutso roles with some droll lines that sound all the spicier delivered . everyone is great and gives their all . the movie is all one long action set-piece , which is what the action fan expects when they plunk down their money then sit down with their popcorn . they get their money 's worth here and then some . `` speed '' was obviously written by someone who loves action films as much as the action film fans that watch them . good match-up . nine stars for `` speed '' , and let 's hear it for the magic of surveillance cameras .		9		1
i loved this film as a kid and still do ! , i wo n't make this long because all the other reviews have pointed out many of the good points . this is a classic and a rare kid film that is actually through the entire length watchable to adults , everything about this film is good , its a feel good film its entertaining it has an absolutely brilliant sword fight between and westley , in fact one of the best i have ever seen , cary elwes exudes charisma while robin wright exudes beauty while all the support are equally superb with the likes of mel smith and billy crystal making very funny cameos . superb , great , brilliant , excellent and quite frankly there are n't enough words in the dictionary i can use to praise this film .		9		1
first , i 've got to say that the black and white cinematography on the tennesse and new york scenes and the color ones on miami have an authentic period feel for the '50s that takes you back to a time that seems so long ago . and gretchen mol looks stunningly and uncannily close to the title character in all her attitude and revealing poses . director/co-writer mary harron brings some of the contrasts of attitudes concerning what constitutes obscene material by having the irving klaw character mentioning that while some bondage scenes of the broadway musical kiss me , kate is considered acceptable , his bondage photos are considered too raunchy for mailing for certain customers ! another person who 's prosecuting the pictures defends a slave girl scene in a tarzan movie as being in a `` film meant for families '' ! any abuse ms. bettie page suffered growing up is mainly implied though she seems to have mostly a sunny disposition concerning both her career and life . nice to see sarah paulson -lrb- studio 60 on the sunset strip -rrb- as legendary playboy photographer bunny yeager , lilly taylor as irving 's sister paula , and john cullum -lrb- formerly of northern exposure -rrb- as a nashville preacher during bettie 's teen years . if not a complete biographical look at the life of ms. page , it 's certainly a very compelling look at the times and conventions she lived through . / : i just found out ms. page died . all i can say is , rest in peace , pin-up queen .		9		1
`` avanti ! '' is a simply irresistible film that has too often been overlooked among its director 's features . like many of billy wilder 's movies , `` avanti ! '' too is a bit long but there 's never a dull moment , and even though the humor gets pretty dark sometimes , the film retains its elegance . the performances are first-rate ; jack lemmon is his usual splendid self while juliet mills proves to be a true find for her role . what really makes the movie , however , is clive revill 's shrewd portrayal of the hotel manager .		9		1
when `` the tree of life , '' terrence malick 's first feature since 2005 's `` the new world , '' started , i admit i thought it might be a slog . as soon as those malick tics -lrb- the whispery voice overs , the restless camera , the copious shots of trees , flowers , rocks , etc. -rrb- made their appearance , i gave an internal roll of the eyes and thought , `` here we go again . '' i 've loved some malick films -lrb- `` the thin red line '' -rrb- and i 've greatly disliked others -lrb- `` the new world '' -rrb- and i know how tiresome his particular style can be when he 's off his game . then early on in the film , i found myself mesmerized by a long montage of images showing the natural world at work , and from that point on i was hooked . the sheer aesthetic beauty of the film would probably have been enough to keep me interested , but the story that begins to emerge from the images -- about where the life cycle of one human being fits into the greater scheme of the world and the universe -- is equally as compelling . the film 's central theme is the difference between living a life founded on the belief of a higher being and one founded on the belief in the randomness of the natural world , and the pitfalls that go with both . i imagine what `` the tree of life '' is ultimately `` about '' will be informed largely by the personal beliefs of the viewer . but i think malick is suggesting that one need not choose between two mutually exclusive ideas . that one can believe in a god without expecting answers to all of the scary unknowns the world might throw one 's way while at the same time accepting the sometimes arbitrariness inherent in the world 's natural processes without neglecting to see the beauty and majesty amid the chaos . this is a truly exquisite movie , one of the best i 've seen this year . grade : a		9		1
films are not created in a political vacuum and zefferelli 's 1968 production of `` romeo and juliet '' came at the height of the so - called `` youth culture '' , the time of the summer of love , student unrest -lrb- oh god it 's so hard to be an oxbridge undergrad , yah ? -rrb- , the anti vietnam war demos , the october revolution and all those other ultimately futile adolescent pastimes our current senior politicians and legislators indulged hormonal youths of both genders questioned the values and beliefs of the older generation so had shakespeare 's iconic couple thus signor zefferelli was on safe ground aiming his film directly at those who saw themselves as saviours of the world at least until they got a job at . as olivier 's `` richard the third '' was obviously a product of post - war austerity and branagh 's `` hamlet '' the last hurrah of excessive consumption thus this particular `` romeo and juliet '' comes from an age that worshipped at the altar of of the adult roles are depicted as wrong - headed or well - meaning but the other hand the flower of youth - capulet or montagu - is idealistic , loyal and courageous . it may be shakespeare - lite but it is full of vitality and movement . mr whiting and miss hussey are sweet and innocent , optimistic and full of energy and longing as only first - time lovers can be . they add a breathless freshness to those portions of the text they are given to truly do not understand why they can not be permitted to be together.they echo the eternal teenager 's cry ... `` why ? '' , and receive no answer they can accept . fiery performances from messrs mcenery and yorke and a compassionate one from mr o'shea contribute hugely to the overall success of the film . no matter how well you know `` romeo and juliet '' i think you will find that signor zefferelli has brought something new to the party .		9		1
in the not too distant future , women have stopped giving birth . no one knows how it happened , all we know is that it happened . the world is on the brink of destruction and only britain remains intact . after word that the world 's youngest person has died at the age of 18 , a bomb goes off killing dozens of people in a coffee shop . theo a former activist meets up with julian , former lover and activist and discovers that a young woman kee is pregnant . it 's now up to him to get her across the dangerous road side in order to save humanity . cuaron directed the best harry potter film to date and scores again with his recent film children of men . children of men is one of three films directed by the `` three amigos '' the other two being pan 's labyrinth and babel . i have n't seen the other two but it would take something very special to take the top spot . as depressing and desolate as this film is , there is a message of hope all throughout . theo , the main character played by clive owen is thrown into a mission that could mean his life . there are dangers all throughout the world and the last thing he needs is to add more of it near him . theo never seems to smile , other then when he is with jasper , his hippie friend , played comically by michael caine . caine does well with what he 's got . even though the character is suppose to be the comedic relief , caine plays him with a bit of sorrow . owen plays theo with a calm undertone and is convincing as a man torn apart by one terrible incident in his life . it 's a strong performance . the film 's pace is slow when it needs to be and fast when it needs to be . all the characters have one goal in this film and the film never strays from that goal . theo must get this woman to the human project . there are twists and turns on the way to their goal , of course , but it never gets overdone with any subplots . this is surprising because a lot of futuristic films are hard to follow -lrb- 12 monkeys for example -rrb- . without a doubt , children of men is the most visually stunning film of the last 5 years . there are 3 distinctive scenes in which everything is simply breathtaking . first of all would be the ambush on the car . although it 's not all done in one take , it is cleverly edited to make it appear so . the scene itself is not only beautiful but thrilling . the second scene happens half way through the film , but i wo n't say what happens so i do n't spoil it for you . the third scene in question is in climatic battle at the end that is stunning beyond words . the hand held camera adds more authenticity to the scenes in which we all feel like we are in this war torn world . that last scene is as scary as it is brilliant . having owen and the camera operator run through these dangerous encounters is wonderful . i ca n't praise this one scene enough . probably one of the best scenes to grace the screen in cinema history . the film itself is frightening in it 's dark crisp vision of the future . children of men is a remarkable experience and an incredible achievement in film . cuaron and co have created a future that some will claim is a clear cut copy of what we are living in today . politics aside , this future he has presented us is dark . the film has only a handful of lighthearted moments , most of them are with caine in his hippie state . cuaron never sticks us in the face with the film 's message , while films like blood diamond are heavy handed with it 's message , children of men asks us to simply think about our future and what we can do to help it . i ca n't say enough praise for this film and what it has achieved . it 's not only a bench mark in film , but it 's entertaining . with strong performances from everyone involved and cuaron 's keen eye behind the camera , this film is a wonder to behold . i urge everyone to see this film , even if it 's just for the last scene alone . visually pleasing and if you can handle it 's bleak overtones you will enjoy yourself . one of the years top five films .		9		1

billy wilder 's memorable dramatic film , `` sunset boulevard , '' was made in 1950 . the lead role of norma desmond , a washed-up actress , had first been offered to actresses pola negri and norma shearer before landing in the capable hands of gloria swanson . this film heralded the return to the screen by miss swanson after many years . it was well worth the wait . swanson , as desmond , evokes fear and but yet believable to the audience . a has been actress , who dreams of a comeback , she is mystified by the appearance of william holden , an apparent gigolo , who made a wrong turn with his car and entered the desmond world . norma is needy and emotionally ill . her butler , played by the excellent erich von stroheim , admits to holden , that he had been married to desmond years before . though the marriage had faltered , he remained to tend to her needs . he even sends her cards with the names of her adoring reality long since gone . like a magnet , desmond is attracted and immediately attached to the holden character . when he ultimately attempts to leave her , she shoots him dead and acts as if this was part of a scene in one of her films . completely off by film 's end , she tells cecil b. de mille that she is ready for her take . be ready for a tale of misfortune , of great acting performances and an attempt to understand the human psyche .		9		1
the concept is simple -- soldiers vs. werewolves -- but thanks to director neil marshall 's witty script and exuberant direction , superb performances from a likable and very talented cast , and astounding special effects from bob keen , dog soldiers proves to be not just one of the most enjoyable horrors of the decade , but also one of the best werewolf films ever . marshall 's command of his material is superb , and his achievement is doubly impressive given that this is his debut full-length feature . the cinematography is excellent , with impressive use of camera placement , the lens always on the prowl , whether swooping through the woods to give a wolf 's eye view , or weaving between the soldiers as they fight for their lives . the well considered editing , also by marshall , adds immeasurably to the tension and excitement , with a combination of staccato cuts and longer shots used to add variety and interest to the visuals -lrb- if only other modern could learn a trick or two from marshall : films do n't always have to resemble music videos -rrb- . the cast , of whom there is only one genuinely ` recognisable ' name -lrb- sean pertwee , giving the performance of a lifetime -rrb- , are also absolutely brilliant , giving a sense of realism to their absurd situation that makes the terror even more palpable . thankfully , the script -lrb- which -- let 's not forget -- is also by marshall !!! -rrb- never dumbs down proceedings : the dialogue between characters is often funny , but only because the character 's have a great sense of humour , and the manner in which they communicate with each other and react to their plight is always believable . this being a relatively low budget movie , one should not expect mind-blowing transformation effects in the tradition of an american werewolf in london , nor , thankfully , cgi abominations as in recent blockbusters like van helsing . instead , we get fleeting glimpses of beautifully designed and incredibly imposing , courtesy of bob keen , whose sheer size is enough to send chills up the spine -lrb- well , that and the fact that they can tear their victims apart with ease -rrb- . the gore is also up to par , with guts being graphically spilt , heads torn off , and blood splashed all over the place . marshall has since gone on to give fans of fantastic film the wonderful subterranean horror the descent and the enjoyable , but less immaculate post-apocalyptic doomsday -lrb- a spot of self-indulgence from the director , but forgivable given his track record -rrb- , and now seems to be concentrating on action films -lrb- centurion , drive -rrb- . let 's hope that he returns to fully-fledged horror sometime soon , though : he 's so good at it !		9		1
everything , the musical score , the performances , the story line , the dialog all felt right with this production . the attention to the finer details given by hitchcock was what really set this movie to rights , but it did not hurt that there was real charisma there between stewart and novak . stewart , who was hitchcock 's ideal for the `` average american guy , '' was nothing less than stellar in his vertigo performance . his range of talent shows an outright absence of characteristics . he goes from the warm yet aloof `` scotty '' to the angry and downright mad `` scotty '' in such a pure believability that his performance alone is one of the major factors in my assessment of this film as one of hitchcock 's very best . but where would stewart 's performance be without the full-figured and capable talents of his leading lady ? kim novak was arguably one of the best talents of this film era . she was perfectly cast in the role of the mysterious yet earthy type lady of wealth who had a slight ... problem . but , while her performance here was nothing but pure perfection , i must say i liked her character more in `` bell , book and candle . '' this story is one for the arm-chair psychiatrists out there ; fraught with twists and turns , and , you could easily find yourself lost if you look away only for a moment . this is definitely a movie for the thinkers , and not the who enjoy watching a movie while doing other things . this story deserves nothing less than your full attention . while not considered hitchcock 's best work , or even among his best work , while he was still working , this endeavor has come to be known as such since his demise . to look at this now , so many years after its making and see it for the brilliance it was takes only a couple of hours and an adult attention span . he was so far ahead of his time , that his audiences just did not `` get '' the cruel irony of this attempt and as such , we nearly lost for all time one of the greatest masterpieces of suspense ever made . only through the hard work and great dedication of those involved was this brilliant work restored . we are , indeed , fortunate as a society that this was even possible . if you have not watched this movie , there are major spoilers ahead !! i loved the cruel irony of the ending . the fact that she had played him so freaking well only to die as her predecessor had . i thought that hitchcock tried his best to use a fear common to many people ; ie : the fear of heights , in order to draw his audience in . i enjoyed watching hitchcock 's demonstration of scotty 's slow mental spiral as everything began weighing on his subconscious ; all the little details , all the tiny pieces that were swimming around in his head . it really looked as though he would snap , when in reality , he was quietly placing each piece into the necessary slot to make the picture come together for him . i also must comment on the use of the gray suit used by hitchcock and worn by kovak . it was used , imo to make her all the more stunning in the evening gown she wore when scotty first laid eyes on her . everything else she wore after that was black , white or grey , to heighten the beauty of her in that one scene . grey is usually a bad color for blonds . it washes them out and makes them look like they 're wearing green pan for a black and white oldie . but hitchcock did that on purpose as effect . speaking of effects , the camera work here is simply stunning . that and the whole movie was nothing more than a parable teaching us to face our fears rather than surrender to them . this was the best in his suspense line . i loved psycho , too , but i always considered it more the first in the slasher sub-genre rather than suspense . this movie rates a solid 8.9 / 10 from ... the fiend : .		9		1
sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they do n't really degrade in quality from one film to the next . thus , sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan . this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation . harry 's always on the job it seems . clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action , slow , deliberate , and without fear . as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80 's , sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70 's feel that characterizes the first three films . this does n't mean that it 's quality is any less . bottom line : brimming with intensity and action , sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series .		9		1
`` death wish 2 '' is nearly a carbon copy of the 1st . this time , the location has changed from newyork to los wo n't bore you with the plot here , but let 's just say mr vigilante paul kersey -lrb- charles bronson -rrb- is forced back into action , doing what he does of course once again the police ca n't have that.there is one amusing scene where kersey has just saved a man from being possibly killed and his wife brutally flees the scene , and when the police arrive , the only thing the care about is who shot the attackers , never mind that 2 innocent people were questioned about what their saviour looked like , of their saviour , they give some riotous descriptions of him , something along the lines of `` he was a tall black man with red beard or he was 2 feet tall and ha d ac left club movie does not have the importance of it 's predecessor , but it is still a fairly good movie , and still illustrates some good points . 9/10		9		1
i recently saw star trek : nemesis , a next generation movie that was only fair . that quality of a movie made me long for this kind of star trek movie . this is a movie that defines star trek , boldly going , seeking out new life and civilizations , protecting mankind , and doing all of this with the best of intentions . there is nothing dark about movies like this whereas the most recent entries in the star trek franchises have been very dark . in this star trek we find the crew of the enterprise not at all on the enterprise . instead they are on a hijacked klingon vessel they hijacked from the third one . they decide to journey home , where they are in hot water for stealing a klingon vessel and the klingons are not happy about it . also back home are spock 's worried father , sarek , and admiral cartwright , played nicely by brock peters . on their way home the crew encounters a probe of unknown origin . this unknown probe is destroying everything in site and it is heading for earth . spoiler : mr. spock identifies the signals this probe is giving as whale signals . the crew deciphers that they are trying to send signals to earth . here is the problem : the probe appears to be trying to contact a form of whale that was extinct long ago . so what do they do ? of course !!! why did n't i think of that ? they go back in time to take a whale from the twentieth century and bring it to the future to save mankind yet again . this is perhaps the most successful installment of star trek . this installment is relatively lighthearted compared to other installments in the series . there are no great battles in this movie or real intense moments . but this is just a decent little film . one thing i like about this movie is the socially conscious element . this movie really talks about an important issue in this time frame and that is environment preservation and species protection . few people look at it and i am glad this movie did . the movie has its very funny moments as well , including the crew trying to blend in during modern times , as well as spock cussing , that 's great !! there was a scene where the star trek people were in front of a group of tv screens and originally the screens were suppose to have old episodes of star trek . why did n't they ? it would have been great . but this star trek gives way to intensity and science fiction and makes for great light-hearted entertainment . to me this is the second best star trek the first is the undiscovered country , in the original . i have to say first contact is the second best movie overall . this was the last ever star trek before the next generation . for 21 years this was the only star trek , still the best star trek and still very entertaining . this is a fine adventure and a great departure for the original crew to be the only intergalactic travelers , warriors and philosophers . but they were far from done , and even long after they were done they are still only getting started .		9		1
while perhaps a slow-burner to start with , snow cake is a superb film . the film looks wonderful , with beautiful cinematography and an enchanting atmosphere . i also loved how appropriately low-key the score was too , and mark evans does credit for his understated direction . the dialogue is truly excellent , with the comic elements laugh-out-loud and the tragic elements genuinely touching , and the story while leisurely sometimes is compelling and maintains a strong emotional wallop and credibility and heart to its characters , alex being the best developed of the whole piece . the acting is excellent , both sigourney weaver and alan rickman are fantastic and show an able chemistry , and carrie-ann moss is also very good . all in all , a superb film . 9/10 bethany cox		9		1
i was one off the few that thought `` ted '' looked awful . and too be honest , the trailer still makes it look that way . that whole `` thunder buddies '' thing and trying too guess some girls name . they were like , the poorest parts off the movie . do n't know why they choose too have those moments in the adverts , because the flick is way better than them . this is the first movie from seth macfarlane , creator off `` family guy . '' and it really shows . now `` family guy '' is a funny show . but it does get carried away with movie references and attempting too shock us with its crude humour sometimes . `` teds '' also trying too do this . though is succeeds . `` family guy '' tends too cheat a bit by cutting off to some unrelated scene just too squeeze in another joke . while `` ted '' has more off a story , and can be way ruder than the tv show , with most off the laughs coming from one-liners , or just from the banter between its characters . plus it does n't have too stop everything too insert a joke . the gags flow throughout the thing which improves it in my eyes . most off the film is very funny . but what 's surprising , is that is also has some heart . the stuffed bear that 's in the movie maybe swears a bit too much hoping it 'll get a laugh . but there 's no denying that by the end off `` ted , '' you 'll care about him .		9		1
and finally they did it right this time ! `` tron : legacy '' surprised me a lot , leaving the trauma of seeing the first disappointing episode miles away . it 's like comparing the number 8 with 80 , very different from each other and it is so good that a sequel might be coming real soon . call me crazy but this one really deserves all the stars and the possible praise it can get . light years ahead from the 1982 original film , `` tron : legacy '' is all about evolution , on-screen and off-screen . what has changed in the world during the lapse of time both tron films were made -lrb- 28 years to be more precise -rrb- , and why the successful 2010 film is more appealing and more relevant than the previous box-office failure of the 1980 's ? back then , `` tron '' presented a whole new world that very few people had access into , the computer technology , programs and games , all in the early stages of development , just crawling . it was one of the first films to use new technological special effects , very close to what cgi is now -lrb- or some might say that it was cgi 's first age -rrb- . it was a film a little ahead of its time , difficult to understand and to make us involved with all those technical terms about computers and all , and audiences were n't interested in that . even now , it 's not much of a good film to watch , in fact , it 's incredibly tedious but visually fascinating with those colorful clothes imitating computer chips . it 's a cult film to some and i 'm probably one of the very few who really did n't care much for it . a few decades later , technology is accessible and known to almost everybody , we do n't crawl anymore , we 're almost flying , that 's how big we evolved with new electronic medias that change each month . with all that in mind is that this sequel , taking characters and the concept of the original film , was far more interesting , relevant and dazzling than the other movie . `` legacy '' is exciting , simplified , dynamic and powerfully efficient . works perfectly as an sci-fi adventure flick , and also as dramatic piece . now it 's time for sam flynn -lrb- garrett hedlund -rrb- , the son of kevin flynn -lrb- jeff bridges -rrb- to enter into the world of fierce programs and dangerous games inside of an old arcade machine to rescue his father , trapped there since 1989 . themes like friendship , loyalty to family , greed are worked amidst programs fights , chases , duels between creator and creature -lrb- clu , also played by bridges , practically photoshopped to , at the age of 61 looks like he 's 31 -rrb- . the coolest aspect of the first episode and that remains here is the style of the programs , the brilliant thematic costumes and the art-direction mixed with the greatest visual effects of the moment . no more of those dated and cheesy effects . and one special mention to the amazing soundtrack composed by daft punk -lrb- who has a cameo -rrb- that really makes the film more enjoyable . getting wrong with one or two ideas but without making its audience bored or uninterested , `` tron : legacy '' is a very good film , the technical aspects of it are incredibly well-made , the story is pretty decent -lrb- did n't like the ending though , i was expecting a little bit more from it -rrb- and the actors gathered here do a nice job , bridges , hedlund , bruce boxleitner returning as alan , olivia wilde , james frain , michael sheen and jeffrey nordling , all good . surprises me the fact disney wanted to invest on a sequel of a film that was a failure to them a long time ago and surprises me once again that they selected a first time director to do the job , but joseph kosinski deserves some good credit for it , making a better work than steve lisberger -lrb- who produced this one -rrb- did . it 's very rare sequels getting so much improvement , as if a first film were never made . so , i would n't mind seeing a third installment for the tron series . if get this good , i 'll watch it right away . 9/10		9		1
seth mcfarlene is a genius . sure , some of his jokes on family guy miss the mark , but most of them are brilliant . so when i heard he was directing ted , it just sounded right . when you 're watching the film , you truly get the essence of the show right from the opening scene , and thank goodness it uses the good jokes . what drew me into the movie the most , besides its premise , was it 's lead actor , mark wahlberg . what i admire about wahlberg is that he does things that are out of his comfort zone , like 2010 's the other guys . here , he honestly gives one of his best performances as a 35 year old man child named john . and even though he seems out of his comfort zone , something feels right about it . the movie revolves around a john and his talking teddy bear named ted -lrb- voiced by mcfarlene himself -rrb- . john was a lonely kid and wished that his teddy bear was real , and so overnight he became just that . but years go by , and now john and ted are grown up , sitting around their apartment getting baked , watching flash gordon , and making john 's pretty girlfriend lori -lrb- the wonderful mila kunis -rrb- a little mad . so , she gives john an ultimatum , and the movie goes on from there . but i ca n't give too much away . ted is absolutely bonkers . it 's a wild , ridiculous , occasionally obnoxious , strangely clever and sometimes hilarious movie filled with surprisingly decent performances from all of its actors . this is one the best movies of the year so far , and it feels bizarre to say that but it is so true . it felt like the laughs did n't stop , even if some of them were better than others . see it . a -		9		1
spoilers personally , i 'm not an enormous fan of the original `` spiderman '' movie . whilst some friends are huge superhero buffs , the limitation of aspects of spiderman 's life is enough for me . anyway , the first time the web slinger featured felt irritating and dull and a film to be watched once and ignored . the sequel , by comparison , has been reviewed by others -lrb- in particular jonathan ross -rrb- as the finest superhero film ever , and this is probably a fair description . in this second chapter in the life of peter parker , we are placed twelve months after the original . beautifully explained by a quality animated beginning which explains all , we are shown straight away the problems our hero faces . simply put , parker 's life is s ** t. unable to hold down a job , he also finds it impossible to focus on his education and his love mary jane is engaged to an astronaut . with a fellow scientist , the brilliant doctor octavious , turning evil , peter is forced to choose between his own life and the life of his alternative being . in `` spiderman 2 '' we have perhaps the finest superhero film ever created . with an emotional peter parker questioning his calling , we are faced with a far from perfect hero . aside from the physical problems superman might have regarding lois lane -lrb- see jason lee 's theory in `` mallrats '' 1995 -rrb- , spiderman is arguably the one superhero to suffer the most . parker is caught choosing between his `` gift '' and his love for those around him . as a result of this choice , he chooses what most of us would probably choose , he chooses a life of freedom . as peter parker , tobey maguire sums up this mood perfectly . at times , maguire shows genuine affection for this desire to help others , whilst simultaneously he shows a deep rooted passion for kirsten dunst 's mary jane -lrb- to be fair , i think anyone would show passion for dunst 's beautiful portrayal , whether mentally or physically . beautiful ! -rrb- . even parker 's latest two rivals , the magnificent james franco as harry osbourne and alfred molina as doctor octavius are superb . franco as harry demonstrates a boy who 's mind is slowly deteriorating as he becomes more and more bitter . in comparison , molina steals the entire film as `` doc oc '' , a genius who is turned to evil by some robotic arms . whilst the first film featured willem dafoe as an extreme norman osbourne , this second installment has a badguy we can truly feel for and associate with . molina 's doctor is a genius with a perfect lifestyle who simply wants to sacrifice as many lives as possible to achieve his goal . this is something many have dreamed of for centuries , and this unusual badguy is no different . ultimately , as with most films nowadays , it is the special effects that win through . it is impossible in personally opinion to be able to differentiate between the real spiderman and the cgi spiderman . both look and act identically and both are exactly as the fan would imagine . the same is true of doctor octopus and his arms . all in all , `` spiderman 2 '' is the ultimate superhero film . whilst very biased due to being aware of potential story lines , i find it difficult to condemn this film . whilst the original film felt like a huge disappointment , the green goblin being useless for one , this film has reaffirmed my faith in the series . my one worry is that we are shown a potential harry osbourne becoming the second green goblin , and i fear the third film reviving the hideous green goblin costume of the first . personally i 'd convert doctor connors into the lizard or i 'd introduce spawn . ultimately however , with this film , sam raimi has demonstrated a beautiful understanding for the spiderman series and i 'd willingly trust him with any marvel creation he saw fit . this film is not the best film of all time , but by far and away it is the best superhero film ever . 10/10 . see this film !		9		1
high noon is an outstanding western that differs from all that of it 's time . while viewing this film it seems as if someone is viewing a spaghetti western because oppose to other american westerns at the time , this one was realistic as it showed a whole town turn they 're back at the man they needed the most . -lrb- may contain spoiler -rrb- i also noticed that don borrowed a lot of this movie for dirty harry . for instance the whole town turning their back on will kane is similar to the whole city officials turning there back to harry . and after kane has finally murdered all the villians he throws his badge on the ground as if regretting ever helping these people . which is what clint eastwood does in dirty harry . 3 1/2 -lrb- *** 1/2 -rrb- out of 4 -lrb- **** -rrb- stars		9		1
the return of slick cop , axel foley -lrb- eddie murphy -rrb- is in for another adventure in beverly hills . in the first movie , axel goes in deep of finding his friend 's killer . in part 2 , police captain -lrb- ronny cox -rrb- get shot , and his daughter jan -lrb- alice adair -rrb- notifies foley in detroit . knowing that his friend is in danger , he does the noble thing and heads off to beverly hills to find out more about the incident . first , he gets to get past a bureaucratic police chief -lrb- allen garfield -rrb- who is mostly all talk , and no action . both taggert and rosewood -lrb- john ashton & judge reinhold -rrb- work together to bring the criminals to justice . i like the music selections the movie made : `` shakedown '' by bob seger , `` cross my broken heart '' by the jets , `` i want your sex '' by george michael , etc. . everything in the movie turned out great . using the mack mixer as a `` decoy '' vehicle really did the trick on thwarting a robbery . brigette nielsen really hit it off after `` cobra '' , she was a very intimidating character in the movie . a little more exciting than the first , although i prefer part one for the music score . part 2 got more action . rating 3.5 out of 5 stars .		9		1
`` kundun '' is martin scorsese 's most underrated film . it 's something quite fantastic to watch such an amazing film about the early years of the dalai lama and the plight of tibetan buddhists knowing that it comes from a man who has long wrestled with his own religious ghosts -lrb- witness the still hotly debated conundrum that is his `` last temptation of christ '' -rrb- . with probably only `` the age of innocence '' to compare to in scorsese 's now hallowed canon , `` kundun '' is a breathtaking work of art -- visually sumptuous -lrb- with beautiful work from cinematographer roger deakins -rrb- , hauntingly transcendental , and deeply symbolic . as an outsider looking in , scorsese manages to create an intimate level of detail that someone who lives and breathes buddhism might have overlooked . many rituals and practices are presented exactly as they are with no attempts to explain their purpose or translate their meaning to western culture . this allows them to keep their rich symbolism , which translates perfectly to scorsese 's visual palette . from the rich colors of meditative sand art to the bright red blood spilled during china 's unlawful occupation of tibet , everything takes on a deeper meaning that leaves much to the imagination and higher mind . wisely , scorsese follows the same template of richard attenborough 's equally resonating oscar winning epic `` ghandi '' by adapting a straight forward approach to his presentation of the dalai lama 's most tumultuous years . except for a few dreamlike vision sequences , he stays mostly out of the man 's head , and instead shows his power through his actions and dedication to his people and the practice of non-violence . `` kundun '' is as near perfect a biopic as one can make .		9		1
for alison scott -lrb- extremely beautiful katherine heigl -rrb- everything should have been just party and more party after she got a dreamed promotion in her work at e ! . for ben stone -lrb- seth rogen -rrb- everything should have been just party and more party yet without any girl just with his cool friends -lrb- jonah hill , jay baruchel , jason segel and martin starr -rrb- , , all together having the usual routine . they had fun together but what 's the only way to watch these two making love ? well you know , it was a crazy night for both so in the next morning we have again these two as the two total different persons that they are from each other ; obviously alison is the `` affected '' one and the one who is going to be cruel . so what 's the only way to make that alison needs to see ben again ? the title of the movie says everything . `` knocked up '' was for me the last movie to watch of the apatow `` family `` releases from 2007 . and yes they are like a family so here everybody is quite known so in that way basically everybody is kind of making a role that they had already made , basically is like they were not even acting , specially jonah hill . again seth rogen and his `` brother '' jonah hill `` command '' the gang that will deliver hilarious stuff , those are a bunch of cool friends from canada , stoners and . the main problem is that basically their work does n't give them any money since their website is cumming soon but soon the other problem will be related with the fact that their soon website is nothing new . on the other side we have a family that have it all but is full of distrust . i understand why katherine heigl is pointed this film as sexist , she said that the film `` paints the women as shrews , as humorless and uptight , and it paints the men as lovable , goofy , fun-loving guys '' . sure but it is just a movie and not because the sister of alison -lrb- played by leslie mann -rrb- is not a very likable character -lrb- yes she is a bitch ! -rrb- every woman is like her obviously . here you will be a hundred percent on the side of pete -lrb- paul rudd -rrb- - he was out just to play fantasy baseball ! - who will be basically ben 's friend to turn this at a point in the men vs. women kind of stuff -lrb- going to cirque du soleil with mushrooms is not a good idea ! -rrb- . anyway , this is a funny movie ; it makes that our big character changes from being a simple lazy stoner to be a productive guy . after all he was a f ****** lucky guy , yes he was very lucky ! for me happens with this movie the same that with `` superbad '' , both are not the masterpieces of comedy that many were and are claiming but both are very enjoyable movies that i do recommend and that i do liked a lot . with `` knocked up '' happens also that it has been pointed for having pro-life themes just like `` juno '' . if you are wondering i 'm pro-choice and these are just movies and both have their characters in a situation and with specific circumstances . obviously that does n't need and are not to be seen as if they were true . anyway , i think that between `` the 40 year old virgin '' , `` superbad '' , `` walk hard : the dewey cox story '' and `` knocked up '' my least favourite is this one but obviously that does n't mean that it was a sort of disappointment , finally it is as entertaining , enjoyable and funny as i was expecting . these movies are those kind of movies that , with the `` pretext '' of showing them to your girlfriend , family , etc. , are very easy to enjoy more than just a single time . that 's very nice . oh and if you were wondering , for an odd reason , about my title , well that 's a line of a kings of leon song that shares title with this movie .		9		1
generally speaking , i do n't like musicals . mostly because of the songs . the two main exceptions are singin ' in the rain and grease , both of which are incredibly fun with very catchy songs . for the most part , though , i ca n't stand the genre , especially the recent flux of them of which this film is the catalyst . but , after hearing all the raves for this one , i decided to give it a go . it was n't my type of movie , and i loved it . the interesting thing is , if this film had n't been a musical , i doubt i would have liked it as much . sure , the direction is innovative and the acting is impressive , but it 's the numerous medleys of contemporary songs that really made this for me . going in , i was under the impression that this was going to be like every other musical -- songs written directly for it . little did i know that david bowie , the police , queen , and even nirvana were all represented in various shapes and forms . i absolutely loved the way in which a vast variety of songs were covered , interpreted , and woven together to create instantly memorable tunes . my favourite ? definitely `` el tango de roxanne '' , but i enjoyed everything else as well . of course , that 's not the only highlight of the film . the incredible visual and directing style is unlike anything i 've seen in a film of this sort before . in fact , it 's really unmatched in cinema in general . the acting is very good , as the stars manage to create three-dimensional characters while also having great singing voices . the story is a brilliant mishmash of doomed romance , slapstick comedy , and even historical drama . the slapstick routine at the beginning crackles with terrific comic energy , and the whole film is incredibly vivid and alive . i have to say this is one of the biggest surprises for me as a moviegoer . a musical romance , two of my least favourite genres , that produced a hit song which i loathe , and i ended up loving the film . go figure .		9		1
i believe in many things , truly , because believing is one of those obligatory terms of life . if you do n't believe in something , it would be having no reason to be alive . that said , believing is maybe the main message of this film . in many moments , when we 're watching it , maybe we can realize how simple it is , just because there 's nothing totally outstanding about it , visually . but its story , is just one of those that carry you all along , no matter what . you do n't have to be a kid to enjoy this one , in fact , it shows adults some things also . the characters in this film are as warm and natural as possible . you know what happens here is no fantasy , it is reality . you could easily see this events any day in your ordinary life . these kids meet the man and they just ca n't let him go . and the greatest thing , it 's that it could be because of them , but mainly it is because of him . this is a man who has so much inside waiting to let go and show , and he has found the people to reveal these things . then there is acting . johnny depp is a genius , in everything he 's ever done . he knows just , no the right , but the only notes , for the specific moments in this film , and in many others . how does he do it ? well , i do n't mind to know if he continues to show magic every time he 's on screen . here he has given another performance of those he can only give . freddie highmore reaches some moving extremes , handling them very well , becoming the revelation of the young cast . and kate winslet is wonderful . there 's just a lot of things that make this movie what it is . you just go and see it for yourselves and let go imagination to those sometimes unreachable places . but you have to believe ...		9		1
looking back at batman begins , the first installment of christopher nolan 's batman trilogy , in conjunction with its sequel the dark knight -lrb- 2008 -rrb- , it is clearly evident that nolan 's vision of the popular comic book hero is nothing less than the sum of the parts that make up a truly well-defined and anti-hero . in nolan 's world , batman is as humanly flawed as bruce wayne himself , and the writer-director makes sure that this is communicated to the audience . in one scene , batman escapes by jumping off a roof in a chase sequence . he lands clumsily and noisily on a retractable ladder that extends itself . christian bale who plays batman/bruce delivers a performance that is neither showy nor restrained . really , it is not about the intensity of the performance but about the motivations behind the actions that define who batman is . even so , by the end of batman begins , it is still unclear who batman really is , though this is explored with more depth in the sequel . this is where nolan hits that rare , illuminating spot that gives us an anti-hero who is well-developed yet has issues with his own identity . batman is a symbol of hope for gotham not by fate but by choice , and even then , nolan throws that symbol in murky waters . while the dark knight is widely considered to be the epitome of the superhero genre , though i would use the term `` superhero '' very loosely here , it would be fatal to see batman begins as an inferior companion to one of the great crime films of the 2000s . batman begins is in my opinion a deeper film than its sequel because it lays the philosophical foundation for a character whose motivation to act not only lies in guilt and anger , but also in the desire to confront the very fear that incapacitated him not to act . batman begins is a film about memory , like a faded photograph . it plunges head-on into bruce 's backstory and situates it in the present , providing ample illustration of the transformative character arc that bruce would go through , and presenting an ambivalent identity he continues to struggle to make sense of in the dark knight . wally pfister 's cinematography here is occasionally tinted with golden brown , alluding to that essence of memory . compare this to the cold and dark bluish tint in the sequel , and it is quite apparent that batman begins is a more humanistic and less cynical picture , though it remains considerably dark by genre standards . this is nolan 's first foray into big-budget hollywood filmmaking , and he treats it as serious as an art-house filmmaker embarking on a personal , independent project . despite its role as a tentpole film for warner brothers , batman begins is distinctively a nolan picture -- a solid blend of realist action and smart ideas . although conceptually different from tim burton 's more imaginative vision of the caped crusader as seen in batman -lrb- 1989 -rrb- and batman returns -lrb- 1992 -rrb- , nolan dares to challenge fans ' perceptions of how a superhero film should be like . by focusing on batman as a human character with an existential issue that is worth investing our emotions in , nolan has avoided superheroes as masked vigilantes who are comfortable in their own artificial skins . in nolan 's hands , batman begins is a masterful action picture that continues to impress with its brawn and wit . with the dark knight rises slated for release in the summer of 2012 , nolan is under intense pressure to deliver a picture that not only should ideally match the dark knight in epic boldness , but should also bring viewers back full circle to the philosophical roots of batman begins , and answer the most important question of all : what is batman ? grade : a -lrb- www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com -rrb- all rights reserved .		9		1
at a little over two hours long , harry potter and the order of the phoenix is tightly plotted , requiring at least an informal acquaintance with the first four movies . but it 's also very well imagined , and what director david yates did choose to show on the screen was more than sufficient to tell the story of harry 's fifth year at hogwarts . at the end of the fourth movie , harry emerged from the triwizard tournament with news that voldemort had returned , and that cedric diggory had been killed by him moments earlier . of course , this news was met with quite a bit of skepticism by the rest of the magic world , most prominently the ministry of magic and the daily prophet , the two places to which ordinary wizards look for solid , substantiated information . even some at hogwarts are dubious about harry 's claims , although not the school 's headmaster , albus dumbledore . because the minister of magic believes dumbledore is out for his job and because he 's jealous of the relationship the great wizard has with harry , hogwarts soon is beleaguered by a brand-new defense against the dark arts teacher , dolores umbridge , whose lesson plan seems to be to prevent students from learning how to defend themselves against the dark arts , an act of repression that stirs harry to begin to teach his fellow students on his own , away from the watchful eye of umbridge , whose unctuous demeanor and oleaginous personality get her appointed as grand inquisitor of hogwarts , allowing her to enact decrees of such oppressive , hate-filled magnitude that the students are more determined than ever to fight back . meanwhile , poor harry is having terrible visions and nightmares , as he shares some sort of psychic connection with the dark lord . seems voldemort desires something , something tangible in the ministry of magic - but what ? harry 's burning forehead scar tells him little , but what visions he does get are n't merely prophetic - they 're of things happening right at that moment . the denouement comes with a terrible , terrifying battle royale at the ministry itself . sadly , one of the good guys does n't survive . i enjoyed a lot of things about this fifth movie : the performances of newcomers evanna lynch -lrb- luna lovegood -rrb- , imelda staunton -lrb- umbridge -rrb- , helena bonham carter -lrb- a delightfully unhinged bellatrix lestrange -rrb- as well as the veterans of the series - daniel radcliffe , rupert grint , emma watson , ralph fiennes , julie walters , david thewlis , gary oldman , and michael gambon ; the jaw-dropping special effects , especially those of the ghostly thestrals , which only luna and harry can see , among their friends ; and the wonderful room of requirement and number twelve , grimmauld place -lrb- sirius ' parents ' home -rrb- . quite a bit of the book 's plot is missing from the movie , of course , including all of the quidditch scenes and the many scenes in which the students practice for and take their o.w.l. exams ; there 's also an important sequence in which harry , ron , and hermione visit st. mungo 's to see mr. weasley and see neville visiting his comatose mother and father - up until that point , only harry knew about the ' fate . about an hour after watching this movie in the theater -lrb- a week after it was released -rrb- , i read the seventh and final book in the harry potter series , making this a true harry potter weekend . really , i 'm about out entirely right now . reading the book and then writing this review means i may have forgotten a few things from the movie that i wanted to mention ; did i hear about such and such via the seventh book or via the fifth movie ? hmm . harry potter and the order of the phoenix is about what it should be - it 's compelling , wildly entertaining , and it keeps in the spirit of the books , if not the preceding movies ; the tone continues to darken as we rocket to the the finale of harry 's life at hogwarts and as the bonds of friendship and loyalty tighten around our collective inquisitive minds .		9		1
he was club fighter going absolutely no definitely had the talent , but not the heart , not the , the impossible is virtually hand picked by the top of the heap , the heavyweight champion of the world.he is given an out of the blue , once in a lifetime opportunity to fight for it all , with little regard to just how much heart and desire he had deep within him.they would find out , would n't they ? when we think of underdogs in the cinematic world , the first one we think of is rocky also is appealing about the film is it 's romantic 's almost school boy like pursuit of adrian makes you root for him not just in the ring but outside of it as well.this is not just the best underdog story in cinema history , it 's also one of the sweetest love stories as well .		9		1

talk about a powerful film.the subject matter is quite controversial , even today : gay film takes place 30 plus years ago , and illustrates the attitudes people had back then and which some people still do penn plays the title character harvey , along with james franco and diego luna put in very strong pivotal performances , and really show just how great they are as actors to portray a gay person as convincingly as they did , and then move on to other projects , and play a totally different character just as rest of the supporting is also very good.if this film , does n't engage you and get you thinking , i 'd be very got my blood boiling a couple of times.it is based on a true story , and there is actual footage from that period used in the film.for me , milk is 9/10		9		1
during the 1960s in minnesota a jewish man named larry -lrb- michael stuhlbarg -rrb- is going through a rough patch . as a school mathematics teacher he is being pursued , and possibly bribed , by a korean student to have his failing grade changed . at home , his own children , including his pot smoking son and self-absorbed daughter , have little regard for anyone but themselves . his brother arthur -lrb- richard kind -rrb- is also causing problems by living off the families couch . worst of all larry 's wife judith -lrb- sari lennick -rrb- wants a divorce as she has openly admitted that she would like to marry their extremely condescending neighbour sy ableman -lrb- fred melamed -rrb- . larry seems unable to come to terms with any of this chaos even after consulting a number of rabbis about his dwindling faith . directed by joel and ethan cohen , a serious man has one of the strangest openings to a film you are likely to see this year . it begins with a prologue set in a nineteenth century village where the characters including , a husband , his wife and a neighbour who was thought to be dead but could be a ghost , speak entirely in yiddish . although this seems extremely odd , what occurs in this episode can be interpreted as like a curse for the continuous amount of bad luck faced by larry in the present . to further reinforce this notion , larry is told during the film that traditions are passed down through generations . it is an opening that will certainly generate a great deal of debate amongst viewers . after this episode though , a serious man , using biographical elements from the cohen brothers themselves -lrb- they are both jewish , born in minnesota -rrb- , is not unlike burn after reading . this is another comedy hilariously depicting a group of extremely shallow , oddball characters whose everyday lives are turned upside down through increasingly bizarre and exaggerated situations . the cohen 's derive a lot of humour from the sheer oddity of scenes and their ability to hold our attention through long silences or random stories , before reaching a punch line that echoes the themes of the film . at one point in the film larry visits a much talked about rabbi . the rabbi 's secretary stares at larry without saying anything . she walks into the rabbi 's long , drawn room , exchanges some inaudible words and then walks out to tell larry in a raspy voice : `` he 's busy '' . it is revealed afterwards that the rabbi was listening to jefferson airplane instead of letting larry see him , reiterating his lack of control in the way people treat him and ignore his needs . in another scene , a lengthy anecdote is told about an ancient inscription that was found by a dentist , while inspecting someone 's teeth . the story itself is of course pointless and inconclusive but it upholds the essence of the film that larry , outside of the classroom , is a man without any answers . nothing is really meant to make sense to him or be conclusive . it is rather fitting that he scribes the mathematical formula of uncertainty on a blackboard . even if the film does not have a thorough arc of character development through its uncertainty of life and a dark and somewhat abrupt ending , this is still a very clever , witty and original film that should be at least nominated for the best screenplay oscar . many laughs in this film are also captured purely from the gazes of the minor characters with their bizarre expressions and mannerisms . the cohen brothers either have an exceptional choice in small time actors or more likely they have precision control over the way that the actors are to perform a scene . all of the actors in this film have been really sharply directed to consistently provide excellent comic timing . interestingly , unlike burn after reading , a serious man is more subjectively focused towards a single character in larry , whose life becomes so dysfunctional and chaotic that it is difficult not to feel something for him . he is extremely spineless in being unable to stand-up to anyone but because everything falls apart he warrants our sympathy and perhaps even our pity . looking eerily like joaquin phoenix at times , michael stuhlbarg is wonderfully expressive as larry , with his face shifting from gloom to sheer disbelief as his life falls apart . fred melamed also stands out as the extremely calm but wholly condescending sy ableman . it is testimony to the excellence of the cohen brother 's script that all of the performances collectively embody so much humour . although without any major actors and a brief running time this may seem like a small cohen brothers film , there is certainly no shortage of skill or effort in both the screenplay and the performances of the talented cast . a serious man may even warrant several viewing to thoroughly understand the complexities of some of the religious undertones . this is a hilarious , refreshing but perhaps also damning look at life in the suburbs of america , not to be missed .		9		1
i stopped short of giving `` mr. blandings builds his dream house '' 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us in the 21st century cringe a little bit : the fact that a black person is the faithful servant -lrb- somewhat reminiscent of stepin fetchit -rrb- . but other than that , the movie 's a hoot . portraying middle class new york couple jim -lrb- cary grant -rrb- and muriel blandings -lrb- myrna loy -rrb- trying to build a house in connecticut , this flick has something for everyone . grant is his usual flippant self , while loy does quite well as merely a wife . but melvyn douglas adds some real laughs as jim 's and muriel 's lawyer bill cole , who seems to have more plans than he 's making clear . as for the house itself ... throughout most of the movie , you 'll probably feel ambiguous as to whether or not you want to live there . the builders , contractors , and others also provide their fair share of laughs . all in all , a comedy classic . also starring louise beavers , reginald denny , sharyn moffett , connie marshall and jason robards sr. .		9		1
moon is a welcome return to pure science fiction . most science fiction films nowadays are what i call `` sci-fi lite - '' that is , they contain science fiction elements within the framework of another genre . but moon is the best real science fiction film that i 've seen in ages . coincidentally it came out in the same year as district 9 , another great science fiction film , but moon edges it out slightly in my opinion . this is a mind-bending film that gives the audience a lot to think about . this is a review , so do not read this unless you have seen the movie . sam rockwell plays sam bell , an astronaut who harvests an energy source called helium-3 for the lunar corporation . bell is all alone on his employer 's moon base with only his computer , gerty -lrb- voiced by kevin spacey -rrb- , for a companion . three years of isolation have put a heavy toll on his mental and physical health . he starts seeing things and gets easily distracted . his poor health causes him to get into an accident while driving a vehicle that 's sort of like a monster truck for moon travel . bell awakens in the infirmary on the base , but something seems fishy . gerty does not want him to go outside and the computer lies to him about taking a conference call with his corporate overlords . so he concocts a scheme to trick gerty into letting him outside the moon base where he makes a shocking discovery - there is a body in the wrecked space vehicle that looks just like him ! it turns out there is another sam bell , and they are both just clones of the original sam bell who is safely back on earth . the two clones have to learn to live with each other and it does n't prove to be easy . from here , the film explores an interesting question : what would it be like to meet yourself ? could you learn anything from yourself ? the two sam bells in fact do have a lot to learn from each other . sam rockwell really makes the film 's insane scenario seem perfectly plausible and he is able to carry the entire film on his shoulders since he 's practically the entire cast ! rockwell is one of the most underrated actors in hollywood in my opinion . moon is an impressive directorial debut for duncan jones , david bowie 's son . aside from creating a fascinating premise , jones employs old school special effects that stand up to the best computer animation in hollywood . you would never guess that the moon base and the vehicles are miniatures - and all of it was done on a shoe - string budget . it just goes to show you that creativity and intelligence can always outdo a large budget . moon is one of those rare intelligent science fiction films that will be loved by fans for a long time . i look forward to more of duncan jones 's projects .		9		1
`` bourne supremacy '' is an excellent sequel to the original movie which is likewise a winner . the energy and excitement of matt damon 's performance is unsurpassed . one becomes exhausted by the time the film reaches a climax . there is no secret that this movie is a great success . the numbers alone attest to that . the acting is solid . the photography is fluid . the musical score is compatible with the pace . after the `` bourne identity '' was released , one could not wait for the sequel to arrive . it is now here and it is a smashing success . i would recommend anyone with a desire to see a thriller , that this is the one for this summer season . put it on your must see list . and one should be prepared to catch your breath for a mind boggling climax .		9		1
imdb top 250 : 221 that is what comes to mind when i watched this movie , and that 's a very good thing . alfonso cuaron has created a very believable future in this original and unique movie . from the beginning , this is a film like few others . it successfully creates a weighty atmosphere , where everything is necessary . the people in the coffee shop are n't extras in theo 's way , they 're concerned civilians . ads are n't there to create an urban feel , they let you know about the situation . and the gunfights and explosions make you feel right in the scene , something few other films can accomplish . in an unsettling way , this vision of the future is nervously close . small technological advancements have occurred , but this is n't the jetsons . it seems like this scenario could happen next year , which puts the thought in your mind , `` could something like this happen ? '' as said before , the plot is original . no babies , no kids , no future . but there is one , and it 's up to theo to bring her to safety , with obstacles on the way . with the plot , the scary future britian , and a very realistic shooting style , you can see the similarities with 28 days later . two issues with the plot : one , i 'm not sure if i missed it -lrb- the talking is awfully quiet -rrb- but i do n't quite know what the ` fish ' organization is fighting for . until we learn about what they did to a major character , there 's no reason to think they deserve to be called terrorists . second , and this is only my opinion , but i thought the film ended too soon , without a chance to see what the future brings . some might like that , i found it a little cheap . how can one birth change fertility worldwide ? i can see alfonso did n't want to delve into the science of it all , but maybe some explanation would make a very good plot great . clive owen does a great job , maybe his best , as the to protector of the future hero type . he was well casted as the modern , rough around the edges guy trying to get by . the direction here is phenomenal . the camera shots successfully make you feel the tension and danger of apocalyptic britian . the entire scene from the russian shelter to the dock was amazing , as well as the car ambush . overall , children of men succeeds in telling its story of hope , while making you think of our own fragile future . with likable characters , thrilling moments and amazing realism , children of men is one of the best movies of the new millennium . 9.0 / 10		9		1
being left gasping for air by the brilliant claustrophobic terror of rec , i got myself set to enter the block of flats again with the second of four planned features in the rec movie series . the plot : orders from their captain to investigate the whereabouts of a group of firefighters trapped in a block of flats , -lrb- that has been quarantined , due to residents suffering from a strange illness -rrb- and to also protect a minister of health called , who is entering the flat to gather information about the deadly the block of flats , the gang geo , -lrb- spain 's version of swat -rrb- begin to suspect that the seriousness of the illness has been kept hidden from them , when they discover , that along with having to deal with `` infected '' people who are ready to kill them on site , is in fact not a health minister at all , but is actually a priest , who has been sent by the vatican to get hold of a sample from the very first person to be infected with the the geo 's do everything to survive the deadly challenge that they find themselves facing , three teenagers decide to find out for themselves what is taking place in the closed off building , by entering the building underground . view on the film : whilst the film does lose some of the claustrophobic atmosphere that made the first part so chilling , due to going into more detail about what is taking outside the infected block of flats , returning writers/directors -lrb- with new screen writing recruit manu diez -rrb- jaume balaguero and paco plaza show an impressively subtle touch in the manner of natural expanding on themes briefly touched in the first with building a wonderful wraparound ending to the first part , the writers also make the dark religious element become an extremely prominent feature in the film , as the geo 's and the priest start to fear that the only `` miracle '' they will find in the block of flats will be their own the movie does lose some of the claustrophobic feel of its predecessor , balaguero and plaza hit back with vicious , ruthless horror attacks that truly fight fire with fire , from an enjoyable , puzzle solving to the ending , to the three teenagers finding themselves trapped with nowhere to run , and an unforgettably rough , vhs pause worthy scene involving a gun and a murderous , blood thirsty child , which all help to make this -lrb- rec -rrb- one that you will pause frame by frame , for the faint hope of catching your breath .		9		1
` zulu ' opens on january 22nd , 1879 with a pacifist missionary otto witt -lrb- jack hawkins -rrb- , and his blonde daughter margareta -lrb- ulla jacobsson -rrb- attending a zulu mass marriage ceremony ... the impressive dancing and chanting takes on a different tone when the preacher discovers that zulu forces have massacred hundreds of british troops at and are determined to destroy rorke 's drift , an army outpost , in addition to being witt 's mission station ... the shaken reverend arrives and explains the situation to the british officers , advising an immediate evacuation ... to his horror , the officers decide to withstand and defend their ammunition dump with 139 welch infantrymen , a mixture of committed soldiers and complaining ... the haughty arrogant lt. bromhead -lrb- michael caine -rrb- is in charge , but lt. john chard -lrb- stanley baker -rrb- of the royal engineers - on assignment to build a bridge -- takes command actually by strict seniority ... the situation becomes dramatic by the fact that chard has had no combat experience and , on a distinguished level , he is obviously not from an aristocratic background ... but urgency obliges the two officers to set up the defense of the station , deploy their men tactically , and prepare for the attack ... then thousands of zulus , armed with short spears and captured rifles , arrive on the grassy hilltops ... their unseen advance is announced by a threatening chanting ... and then they come into sight ... long lines of black figures descending the green slopes of the hills , promising with the terrible clash of their shields and spears that soon they are going launch a fearless attack ... their techniques of tribal warfare fashioned an efficient and terrifying fighting force ... they begin to test the british firing power with the life of their warriors ... the british rifles cut them down and they retreat ... but they come again-and again and time getting closer to the station , cutting down the distance ... every withdraw is followed by a deathly silence ... it seems obviously that any of them will survive ... in every disciplined attack they are less in number and ammunition ... after a long night , and at the rise of the sun , the fearful noise suddenly alerts the redcoats to another charge ... most of the men in the infirmary were too sick or injured to help ... few are , like private hook -lrb- james booth -rrb- , who decides much later to take his bayonet and fights heroically in hand-to-hand combat with dozen of black warriors inside the burning building ... outside , the exhausted soldiers prepare for what must be the last charge , but instead they hear a massed yell from the zulus -- a salute of acknowledgment to the braves as they withdraw from the scene ... the battle at rorke 's drift was a decisive one in the british campaign to pacify south africa for european settlers who came to force their culture upon the angry natives ... as a page in british history it has the distinction of being the battle which produced the victoria crosses in few hours - to eleven defenders for their extreme courage - an all-time record for one military engagement ... stanley baker is solid as the engineer who is forced to become a combat commanding officer ; michael caine splendid -lrb- in his first major role -rrb- as the pompous aristocrat ; james booth good enough as the guy who can easily find a reason to check himself into the hospital ; patrick magee excellent as the calm surgeon ; and nigel green , a sergeant of the old order , sternly watchful and understanding of his men but compassionate , as in the last move when he lines the tired and dispirited survivors up for a head count ... he looks at them and quietly advises : ` keep your voices down ! ' the film is a superb account of that bloody engagement , and the fighting is shown in realistic detail ... it salutes the heroism of the zulus and the extreme courage of the redcoats ... cy endfield 's direction gives emphasis to the physical exhaustion of nonstop killing , and the effect it has on men , making some tremble with great fear ... more significantly , he avoids any explanation about the racial nature of the conflict , keeping out politics and history ... with john barry 's menacing musical score , `` zulu '' was filmed in natal , south africa and stephen dade captured the luscious colorful landscapes and the sense of strange isolation ... but the most arresting moment in the film is when enfield 's camera pans over a field carpeted with black corpses , gathered side by side or one on top of the other ...		9		1
the saw a huge amount of `` flying saucer '' pictures storming the us box office , most of which were and primarily existed with the humble intention of providing an hour-and-half of cheap fun for film-goers . in 1951 , director robert wise -lrb- best-known for directing 1961 's west side story and 1965 's the sound of music -rrb- and screenwriter edmund h. north -lrb- of 1934 's all the king 's horses -rrb- created this fantastic film that follows many guidelines of the sub-genre , but digs much deeper than the average `` alien invasion '' film . the film is not only significantly more advanced in the film-making prowess than similar films from this era , but also in philosophy and social commentary . this film was nominally about an human-like alien and a giant robot , but , in a latent sense , it was about the then-current condition of the human race . working from author harry bates ' clever short story , wise and north have created an imaginative parable on the dehumanizing red scare of the that is neither heavy handed , nor too abstract . i seriously doubt that the commentary on will be lost on anyone who views this movie within the proper context , however , the views of the film-makers fortunately refrain from pounding the metaphor into our head -lrb- i think nearly everyone can agree was unconstitutional , we do n't need a movie to convince us of this -rrb- . wise and north simply use alien invader carpenter as a mirror to reflect the hysterical actions of the majority of the public , with as little judgment as possible . the subtle approach not only makes the impact of the film 's message even more effective , but it also keeps the picture from dating when viewed outside of it 's original context . further assets include the impressively high production values , which includes a spacecraft , and the imposing robot gort -lrb- played by the very tall lock martin -rrb- . wise also draws out believable performances from the entire cast , especially handsome michael rennie , who tackles his role with intelligence and just the right touch of whimsy . the film also benefits immensely from downplaying the various supernatural occurrences ; wise basically films the picture as a straight drama for the most part , which lends an immeasurable aura of credibility to the fantastical proceedings . over 55 years later , the day the earth stood still remains a benchmark in the science fiction film-making , and it served as crucial launching pad for many of the intelligent genre films that would follow .		9		1
it took me few minutes of thought to finally realize the implication and the meaning of the title . what would 've been a pleasant experience of a crime investigation story about abductors , turned out to be a mind - numbing experience , thanks to the writers for instilling the little details of life values . jake gyllenhall is very good as a cop , but hugh jackman steals the limelight and proves he 's more than meets the eye -lrb- wolverine ? -rrb- . supporting cast is good and paul dano is just terrific with what was given to him . there is nothing new about the story , in itself . but then it evolves into something bigger & thankfully deeper , which is the only reason it stands out . other factors that sweep the experience into a great thing are the refined & genius music , fine cinematography & a brilliant direction . the period attribute is critically and serves the main . how families react when a member disappears is shown on a larger scale . the character study is also a point to be noted while you watch . certain elements in the film could 've be done without because the confuse more than they adhere . except that i thought the editing could 've been more strict , prisoners is another great experience of the year . kudos to the crew ! bottom line : highly recommended ! the climax is filled both with charisma & ambiguity . can be watched with a typical indian family ? yes profanity : very mild | / : no | violence/gore : very critical | alcohol : strong | smoking : no | drugs : very mild		9		1
dagon has been one of my favourite movies for quite awhile now , and in my opinion it is easily one of the best horror films of the last decade . for me it 's only real flaw was some very poor cgi , otherwise it is nearly a perfect movie . first off , gordon creates a wonderful atmosphere for the village of imboca ... dark , wet , just plain eerie all around . same goes for the residents of the accursed place , they were very well done and creepy . unfortunately i 've never read the story that this is based on , the shadow over , however it does capture the overall sense of dread that pervades so much of lovecraft 's work . ezra godden made for a very realistic hero , something that is all too rare in horror but , once again , fits perfectly with lovecraft 's style . the ending , which i wont spoil in case some poor soul has n't seen this film yet , is very cool . a bit predictable , but still very cool . if you have n't seen this film i cant urge you enough to go rent or buy it a.s.a.p ! 9.5 / 10		9		1
i 've seen this many times throughout the years and also have the version with the music score that was added in 1999 by film composer phillip glass and i do like the music he added to it . based on the stoker this film version was adapted from the broadway play . bela lugosi reprises his role from the stage play written by hamilton dean and john l. as dracula in this film version and herbert bunston reprises his role to film of dr. steward from the same play . director tod browning was successful in a number of films he directed in the horror genre in the devil doll and mark of the vampire . he also directed the unusual film about circus freak show performers called freaks . browning got his directing start in the early days of silent film and was also a successful writer and had written the story the hypnotist that he adapted to the lon chaney film london after midnight . chaney was to star as dracula in this film but he died before the film began and browning turned to the original broadway star of the play , lugosi to star in the film . the role of course made lugosi a household name but typecast him in the role and similar vampire roles for the rest of his career . austrian-born cinematographer karl friend who had a long career as a cinematographer , director and producer photographed this film . he had come from the german expressionist movement of film-making and had photographed fritz lang 's metropolis among many others . his career would include such films as the good earth , camille , conquest , key largo and the pride and the prejudice and he received several academy award nominations and also went on to be an innovator in television film . as a director freund directed the classic the mummy . among the cast are helen chandler , david manners , dwight frye and francis dade . this is a creepy classic and a trend setter in sophisticated horror and did much to re energize the dracula story and i would give it a 9.0 out of 10 .		9		1

fernando meirelles made a perfect movie called city of first movie spoken on english is the constant gardener , another great movie from this great movie is a political it is not a traditional political movies like the sum of all fears and the interpreter are political thrillers with action scenes.the constant gardener is a political thriller without action scenes and this movie reminded me the quiet american another great movie.the message this movie leaves is simply great.but the best thing of all is that behind all the mystery this movie has there 's a love story and that is simply great.if you wan na see a great and intelligent political thriller , you need to watch the constant gardener .		9		1
this is on of my favorite series together with spin city , will & grace and ally mcbeal . i do n't know why i like it so much . the humor is great and the characters very funny but i think it has to do with the whole atmosphere . in the beginning of the series , with a group of 6 , i had the same kind of group . may be this helps to like the series more . anyway , it is very funny and even in the ninth season it still has some original things . check it out .		9		1
this is the first movie i have seen with gary cooper . saying that may make me sound that i am not from this planet , but to be honest , trying to find a good old 1950s western is rather hard these days . after saying that , i am glad that i got to see a movie starring gary cooper . `` high noon '' is a great old western . cooper gave a great performance as the marshal of a small , apathetic town william kane . he does n't deliver one-liners or clichés that john wayne often did in his movies , rather he immersed himself as a character who stands his ground against four men who are sent to kill him over his past . i found that director fred zinneman was able to capture such a tense movie wonderfully , using a variety of camera angles and shots such as pans and crane shots . i will note though that i found it funny in one crane shot , when the camera pulls out from the town before the big finale . it pulls out too far , revealing parts of los angeles in the right hand corner of the screen . anyway , the editor also did a decent job in building tension as well . the first half hour is dry with many long shots , but as kane is forced to look for deputies to assist him , the editor uses multiple shots that are probably no longer than five seconds in each scene . this technique keeps it interesting and making the film feel all the more suspenseful . a well-deserved oscar there of ' 52 . but the one let down in this movie is the music . the score was n't bad , but i could n't stand the theme song that is used throughout the movie . flat out saying it , it was annoying . other than that , `` high noon '' is a great old western that lovers of the genre would get a treat out of . 9/10 i will note though that this is not an action-oriented western . there is only one big shoot-out at the end . the film is based on character versus action .		9		1
when i was about to see this movie first time i had really no expectations , was hoping for not completely cliché and boring film , and when i saw the runtime of almost 2.5 hours i had doubts of watching it and possibly wasting that much of time ... and boy was i wrong . this movie does n't only make my top 3 bond movies , but also top 20 action movies of all time , movie is fast-paced which is amazing for such a long movie , scenes are really amazingly well done and they never let you take your eyes off the screen . movie has two big turnarounds at the end which is really great , just when u thought it 's over it is n't ! daniel craig made an ok bond appearance which was n't too hard to make with the screenplay he was given . 9.3 / 10		9		1
` underworld ' has everything that horror and action fans should want : violence , action , a good cast , vampires , werewolves , real-looking stunts , and a good storyline.the only thing that this movie lacks is do n't have a problem with there only being one passionate kiss in the movie , but some people wish that there was more `` action '' , if you know what i sequel manage to take care of that there 's one person we should thank for his/her performance in this movie , it should be kate beckinsale . thank god that she took the part of her , the movie probably would n't be as good as i am describing how good it really is.i really want to see the third film.it looks really cool .		9		1
kiss kiss bang bang reviewed by sam osborn rating : 3.5 out of 4 writer/director shane black has certainly fulfilled the pre-requisite requirements for successfully creating a crime thriller . he wrote the lethal weapon series , after all . but he seems to know the genre a tad too well . with kiss kiss bang bang , black seems to have emerged on the other side of genre understanding and now looks back upon it with a disdainful eye . his film is a farce of the genre ; a dirty little prank upon his previous work . it 's neurotic and self-indulgent , ignorant of its own plot -lrb- a story not even the narrator approves of -rrb- , and a complete laugh in the face of what the genre has come to stand for in recent years . but because of this , kiss kiss bang bang -lrb- kkbb -rrb- strangely works . we find harry lockhart -lrb- robert downey jr. -rrb- as he 's robbing a toy store to find a christmas present for his son . this shopping excursion is cut short , however , when harry 's partner is incidentally shot in the getaway . now alone and running on foot from the cops , harry scrambles into the first room he can find , which coincidentally is a film audition for the role of a burglar who just caused the death of his partner . fancy that . harry gets the role , and finds himself the next day at a ritzy party in los angeles . there he meets gay perry -lrb- val kilmer -rrb- , a homosexual private eye hired to help harry learn the art of investigation for his upcoming role . also at the party is harmony faith lane -lrb- michelle monaghan -rrb- , a girl who suspiciously looks like harry 's high school crush that got away . later that night , harry tags along with perry to a stakeout that expectedly ends up in murder . i would elaborate farther , but kkbb seems about as interested with its plot as a dog is with a cat . instead , shane black seems indelibly interested in his characters , a welcome change to the crime thriller genre of recent years . harry introduces himself early on to be the narrator of the movie , saying that he 's not all too prominent a host , but do we see any other willing narrators standing around ? thus , we 're lead through the plot by a shaky , neurotic hand that jumps about on whims of flashbacks and nearly forgotten subplots . at one point , harry promises to elaborate on a flashback , then forgets , but later remembers again and jumps back to the subplot . and as annoying as it may read on paper , the narration strangely works . black knows his story 's weaknesses , and smudges them out by allowing indulgence with harry lockhart 's character . at particularly clichéd points in the picture , harry stops the film on its reel -lrb- similar to how would in my disney favorite the emperor 's new groove -rrb- and explains how much he hates these particular clichés in movies and apologizes at their inclusion in his own film . the irony to this method is that kkbb 's plot is n't actually all too bad . it 's better , in fact , than most crime thrillers of late . but without harry 's narration , the film would probably fall into mediocrity , even despite black 's zany characters . the most antithetical of these characters is val kilmer 's gay perry . it 's almost as if black imagined the formula-based role of `` tough guy '' , then decided on a character in the polar opposite direction . but he spares us the ignorant , slanderous gay men from more mediocre films ; perry wo n't give harry gaudy fashion tips or speak in a lispy , high-strung tone . he 's simply homosexual . black avoids political incorrectness by making the situation funny , not the homosexuality , unwilling to allow his film to sink to low-brow gay jokes . but he 's not too proud , however , to work beyond physical humor . at one point , harmony accidentally chops part of harry 's fingers completely off . it becomes a running joke from there , with harry departing from his phalanges on several more occasions . with such an indulgent character as harry , black must have toiled for hours over whom to cast for the role . robert downey jr. is the fruit of these labors ; and quite a delightfully sour fruit indeed . the performance is pitch perfect , downey jr. injecting meticulous amounts of confidence and neurotics into the assuredly unique role . there 's also some welcome , and unexpected , chemistry to be found between downey jr. and michelle monaghan , who plays the voluptuous harmony . i 've become accustomed to complaining about a lack of chemistry between actors , only now to be completely surprised to find sparks in the most unlikely of places . but this is my feeling on the whole about kiss kiss bang bang . i walked in expecting little , but came away deliciously surprised . it 's a film noir that strives continuously to be also a farce , but finds itself caught somewhere in between . - reviewed by sam osborn		9		1
john carpenter has directed all types of films , but starman quite possibly is his best romantic and family-friendly of all . it still keeps in his science fiction roots as an alien descends into wisconsin by meteorite and then transforms into the body of karen allen 's recently dead husband by way of photographs , hair samples , and family home movies . the focus really is not so much on the fact that he is alien but rather what is human - both good and bad . questions about love , courage , honesty , and integrity either directly or more subtly emerge as bridges , giving a tour-de-force performance as the alien , tries to assimilate into the society and culture with which he has landed in . humans are portrayed as one might expect : hostile , intolerant , greedy , vain , compassionate , understanding , and a range of other emotions . jeff bridges shows us us through his learning to adapt to human form . allen is as always very good in her role showing a good deal of pathos dealing with a life form that looks just like her dead , husband and who she knows is alien . there are many carpenter touches that reinforce his sometimes overlooked directorial abilities . the film has a taut pace , suspense when needed , comedic interludes , poignant scenes , and an overall message designed to make viewers think . the rest of the cast is provided with the likes of richard jaeckel as a bad government agent and charles martin smith giving a fine performance as an understanding government subordinate . starman is a finely crafted , hugely entertaining film .		9		1
an awesome shocker in every truly great way . decoy is a slow burner and when its pace gathers and the pieces of the story -lrb- and jean gillie 's astonishing character performance -rrb- come together ... . . well i wish i was in a big audience for that collective revelation and reaction . i guarantee the last half an hour is enough to have anyone gobsmacked at her behaviour . the version i saw is the grainy tv print from europe , so to see decoy in a new print in a cinema with a crowd would be one of the great events you could want . i want it - and this just confirms again why i love monogram pictures . this film is worth the hunt ... and godard was right . read all the other rave comments for the storyline ... but do not miss this monogram 1946 decoy under any circumstances !		9		1
the only problem with setting the bar so high is that then you are expected to always perform at that level . pixar set the bar so high with some of its masterpieces that whenever they come out with an above-average animated film , its still `` disappointing '' because it 's compared to its other brilliant creations . the incredibles suffers from this , and so does cars . but , just like the incredibles , cars is a superb tour-de-force that should entertain the entire family . from the beginning fun-filled race to the great ending , cars is a technical achievement , visually appealing , and also contains a great message , one that does not seem forced unlike other animated movies . as a matter of fact , this is perhaps the best animated movie since finding nemo three years ago . cars focuses on lightning mcqueen , who is a fast-talking , cocky , arrogant , independent rookie whose first year in racing has proved to be a very successful one . yet , during his drive to california in attempt to claim his first piston cup trophy , he becomes sidetracked and is stuck in a secluded town called radiator town full of friendly cars led by a quiet yet bitter car with a mysterious past . throughout the movie , lightning attempts to leave the town , but the citizens are not going to just let him go without a fight . casting is amazing . owen wilson perfectly matches his character , lightning mcqueen , and larry the cable guy actually provides some laughs as mater . paul newman is excellent as the humble doc hudson , and the rest of the cast -lrb- cheech marin , tony shaloub , george carlin , john ratzenberger , michael keaton -rrb- did a great job as well . pixar separates itself from most other movie companies because there is a lot of focus in storytelling , and the script was very good , and the dialogue has many humorous moments as there are one-liners sprinkled all-over the place . watching the credits , one would see the amount of research put into the movie as well as dedication and effort , and that is something that really does n't happen much with movies nowadays , especially those that come out in the summer . while it is not the funniest pixar movie nor is it the one with the saddest moments , the blend of comedy , drama , and hint of racing action is spectacular . the pacing totally slows down as the setting changes , which is a rarity in itself . you sometimes forget that they are all cars as they showcase their happiness , sorrow , and pain through their dialogue , tone , and also their facial expressions like a human being . some moments actually had the audience collectively saying `` awwww , '' or collectively gasping , or collectively breaking out into laughter . if anyone complains about the pacing of the film , then they obviously missed the message . cars shows that at times , its best to slow down and take life slowly , not constantly have to go out their to win the gold , to earn the money , to gain respect . if you complain about the pacing , then you are a victim of the fast-paced world we live in . animation is utterly startling , so rich in detail , so rich in color . everything visually is practically perfect , from the tire tracks in the background to the little scratches in the main character 's car , to the thousands of spectator cars witnessing the race . it is hard to blink because missing a moment of cars would be a punishment to the eyes . showcasing emotion through facial expressions in automobiles is not easy , yet pixar pulls it off like it was no problem at all . it is obvious years were put into this movie . bottom line : i ca n't put enough praise on this film to fit into this review . in a world of sequels , remakes , and disasters , it is nice to see that there is still some creativity out there and that there is still a company that can flesh out quality movie after quality movie . cars has excellent casting , a great story , detailed animation , a superb ending , and a hefty dose of drama to blend in with the humor , cars is a blast -- much better than previous dreamworks efforts , better than any blue sky movies , and even better than the latest wallace and gromit production . you would have to go back to 2003 to find a better animated film , when finding nemo surprisingly destroyed the summer competition for a very long time . cars should add some nostalgia for the adults , and should also entertain the kids despite it being almost two hours in length . 10 years and still running well , good job pixar . cars : not the first good movie of the summer , but the first great movie of the summer .		9		1
richet 's ma 6-t va cracker is a legend and his carpenter re-make assault on precinct 13 is a fluent and explosive action update . clearly an accomplished filmmaker with a flair for violence , he was evidently attracted by the sheer ambition of this project but also the complexity of a gangster who , flourishing at the time of the red brigades and , came to think of himself as not just an outlaw but a revolutionary , who wrote two autobiographies , and thus provided material for film-making that would be both layered and epic . this double biopic , part one in 113 minutes and part two 132 minutes , resembles soderbergh 's che diptych . it too is neither a feature nor a mini-series , but a vanity project , a labor of love devoted to an ambiguous hero that 's hard to market and unsuited to normal theatrical distribution patterns . both parts are saddled with the biopic burden of a churning chronology and an ever-shifting cast . it 's rather conventional and heavy-handed -lrb- though mostly successful -rrb- in its use of marco beltrami 's loud surging studio music to augment excitement and heighten suspense . but it 's at least as three-dimensional and logically structured as the soderbergh project , and it has a star in vincent cassel who was made to play this role -lrb- richet has said that there would be no mesrine without him -rrb- and despite pacing endows the protagonist with complexity . the film may be accused of jamming in too much incident and allowing too little reflection but i was impressed beyond expectations . richet 's first part shows the formation of a . mesrine 's bank robberies and prison breaks are so spectacular and defiant that he 's declared `` public enemy no. 1 '' in two countries , canada and france , officially one of the most famous and dangerous criminals in french history , a figure cops wet themselves over and women want to sleep with . mesrine , both parts , is full of the sense of how intoxicating it is to live outside the law , and how deeply cinematic gangster life is . vincent cassel is charming , charismatic , and loyal to his accomplices as he is ruthless and violent , a complex and magnetic figure who keeps changing from one sequence to another . the second part shows him playing the role , a media-savvy public icon who would seek front page coverage and give paris match an exclusive interview while on the run . loud , kinetic sequences alternate with quiet ones . this is a great and challenging role for vincent cassel , the role of a lifetime , appearing in every scene over a shoot , 45 pounds put on , early sequences shot at the end with the weight gain . the cast is full of first rate actors , including depardieu , ludivine sagnier , amalric , samuel le bihan , olivier gourmet , cecile de france , and more . this is not only an impressive and expensive project with high production values and an excellent technical package . it 's watchable and well done and at the end of part one i was eager for part two . mesrine begins as an agent of de gaulle 's colonial ambitions as a soldier in the algerian war . `` the marseillaise was playing when they put a gun in my hand -- my hand developed a taste for guns . '' like american iraq war vets `` jacky , '' as his parents called him , came back to his well off upper bourgeois parents -lrb- they live in a château -rrb- unstable and hungry for violence . war has taught him to torture and murder . it 's also left him with a racist hatred of arabs . his father finds him a job but he prefers to work for a fat , tough crime boss named guido -lrb- an excellent gerard depardieu , so submerged in his role he 's almost unrecognizable -rrb- . mesrine -lrb- pronounced `` , '' not `` , '' as he later insists to cops and journalists -rrb- is fighting a war with the rich that may be a war with his own origins . a trip to spain gets him a beautiful wife , sofia -lrb- elena anaya -rrb- . he 's no good as a father , but he remains linked with his firstborn , a daughter , for the rest of his life . after a stint in jail , mesrine gets a regular job to be there for his family . but he 's laid off , and goes back to guido . sofia objects , and he beats her up . sofia disappears , and the film drops that thread . escape from the cops leads jacques to go to canada with a new girlfriend , jeanne schneider -lrb- cécile de france , also submerged and barely recognizable -rrb- , met like the other women in his life in a bar . this one is not just a bedmate but a willing partner in crime . denied immigration status in canada and told to leave the country , mesrine and jeanne hide by becoming housekeeper and butler for a wealthy disabled man , but clashes with other staff lead them to lock him up and extort money from his son . this fails and they flee , but are extradited back to canada from arizona . mesrine 's subsequent hellish treatment in the quebec province spc -lrb- special corrections unit -rrb- , worthy of abu ghraib or guantanamo , is graphically depicted . this prison and escape sequence is anchors the film . with jean-paul mercier -lrb- roy dupuis -rrb- , his quebecois accomplice from the extortion scheme , mesrine breaks out in broad daylight . they immediately rob two banks and , keeping a promise , return to the prison armed to the teeth and attempt -lrb- unsuccessfully , but messily -rrb- to liberate the other prisoners . after this , mesrine is declared `` public enemy no. 1 '' in canada . he has arrived . the storytelling in this first half is breathless but compelling . it is given particular coherence and focus by the vivid canadian sequences and the prison escape . l'instinct de mort debuted in paris theaters october 22 , 2008 . it is part of the rendez-vous with french cinema at lincoln center , march 2009 .		9		1
the corleone family saga begins with brando granting -lrb- or refusing -rrb- the requests of his friends , family , and neighbors during his daughter 's wedding . that 's just the beginning of the epic saga that put the name puzo on the map . this is a very graphic depiction of the `` family '' scene . it marks the end of one 's control of a territory and the dawning of a new era when pacino takes over the `` family '' business . if you have n't seen this movie , yet , do yourself a favor : do n't wait 30 years like i did . watch it ! it was on one of the premium channels the other night and i taped it . i knew it was three hours long and i always thought i would not have the patience to watch it , but i did . in fact , they are showing part two tonight and i am taping that to watch tomorrow night .		9		1
i wish there was a law against making these big-budget soppy pictures with nauseating children and syrupy music . i know there 's a market for flicks and chris columbus -lrb- his company name : 1492 -rrb- is a spielberg protégé out to make money not history , but give us a break . do people really exchange snippets of wisdom from morning until night ? evidently the half-dozen unknown writers who worked on this derivative script thought so , but i beg to differ . susan sarandon and julia roberts ploughed some of their earnings into this crowd-pleaser , but no amount of emoting by sarandon can overcome the sad fact that her character looks about 15 years too old to have a seven year-old child . she resembles his grandma . moreover , her character exists in limbo , with no friends , mother , or other to hold her hand while her nightmarishly and sanctimonious husband makes out with a lenser half his age . that 's what you get for marrying a lawyer , i guess . what gives me the creeps about this film ? it 's the emotional pornography . just as porno acts of privacy , this movie probes into emotionally intimate moments , e.g. when a child asks innocently : `` are you dying ? '' in a truthful treatment , perhaps it would be tolerable , but in the glitzy context of a money-making vehicle , sorry , that 's invasive and unpleasant . significantly , the film-makers ' slip of moral judgement concerns sex , when julia roberts 's adulterous character spouts off-colour material at her 12 year-old putative step-daughter , and her misjudged words are endorsed and validated in the subsequent action . on the other hand , hypocritically , not the slightest whiff of the frenzied sexual activity that ostensibly drove this adultery appears in the film . i enjoyed the attitude of the 12 year-old daughter -lrb- jena malone -rrb- to her father 's tart , and i cheered at every one of her well-aimed taunts , and those at her father as well -lrb- ed harris -rrb- . dad : `` you do n't walk out on your mother . '' daughter : `` no , that 's your job . '' i never once believed the relationship depicted between the adulterous lawyer and his gormless young , and found his imposition of her on his suffering ex-wife to be spoiled and self-centred , although the movie thoroughly endorsed his behaviour . of course the whole charade is an elaborate hoax . in the vast majority of such cases , when a father departs with a spring chicken , leaving the menopausal mother in the lurch , he is rarely or never seen again . the ones who cruelly attempt to bring mother and mistress together usually get egg all over their faces . this is largely phony trash , avoid carefully .		2		0
bruce willis and tracy morgan team up for a raunchy r rated buddy cop movie directed by none other than the great kevin smith . what could possibly go wrong ? everything . that 's what . cop out is complete and utter crap . it is a movie about two goofball cops , jimmy -lrb- willis -rrb- and paul -lrb- morgan -rrb- , who get suspended from the force after a drug bust goes horribly wrong . desperate to pay for his daughter 's wedding , jimmy decides to sell an antique baseball card worth 80 grand . while selling it the pawn shop he is at gets robbed and the card is sold to the same drug dealer jimmy and paul tried to bust earlier . the two then go on a search to get the card back , not caring who they have to beat up or what they have to do to get that card back in their hands . this film is immature , stupid , unoriginal , and just plain not funny . at first i could n't believe that the likes of kevin smith , who i just love , could make such an awful movie . but then i realized that the real culprits of this movies awfulness were the writers . the film is written by a couple of hacks named robb and mark cullen who could n't come up with an original or at least funny conversation or situation for this movie to save their lives . thus , kevin smith is not completely to blame for how bad this movie is . i do n't know why he thought it would be a good idea to direct this film . maybe it was because he wanted the opportunity to work with bruce willis and tracy morgan , or maybe he just lost a bet . either way , shame on you kevin smith for agreeing to direct such an awful script . i hope you have learned from your mistake . now , i love bruce willis and tracy morgan . bruce willis has been in some of my favorite movies and he has some really great range . and then there 's something about the way tracy morgan talks that just cracks me up , as long as he 's delivering funny lines , which in cop out he is not . but what is amazing is that neither of these two actors do well in this movie . their characters are a couple of bumbling buddy cop stereotypes with no originality or thought put into their design . but the sad part is that it does n't even look like willis and morgan are having fun with this film . they just seem to deliver their lines , make some funny faces , do a few stupid things , and that 's it . i did n't feel any sort of enjoyment or motivation from their performances and they just do not help this film out at all . if anything , they actually drag it down . but honestly , everything in this film drags it down . now , i will give this film the benefit of the doubt and say that it was n't really trying to be anything other than an amusing buddy cop film . so i wo n't try to analyze the story and dissect it for plot holes and what not . i accept the fact that this is just a dumb story and the real purpose of this film is to put willis and morgan in some `` hilarious '' situations for our `` entertainment '' so that we can all just sit back and `` laugh . '' but the problem is that this movie is n't funny ! i chuckled maybe once or twice through the entire film which almost clocks in at two hours . most of the time i was just rolling my eyes or thinking of ways that something could have been so much funnier . cop out reeks of pure stupidity in every aspect . when your story is so uncreative and ca n't draw you in for crap , you need your film to be really funny . cop out ca n't even achieve that . i do n't know what i was thinking watching this film . it is just really sad to see a trio of two great actors and a very skilled director come together to make such a turd . normally this is the part where i talk about the things that could have been done in order to save this film and i point out just where they could have improved . but instead i think the best improvement for this film would be if it just did n't exist at all . i can see this film being to kevin smith what piranah ii is to james cameron , or what jack is to francis ford coppola . it is that film that we just need to forget ever happened , and then we can all feel better about ourselves .		2		0
sure , this movie could have been worse - if all the actors had had brown paper bags over their heads . i went into this movie thinking that it could n't possibly be worse than the idiotically meaningless re : apocalypse , but lo and behold , hollywood foiled me once again by producing something so craptacular that it exceeded even my saddest expectations . this movie is a failure on all levels . it is incoherent , nonsensical , boring , meaningless , unexciting , tedious , stupid , moronic , and just plain utterly deadbeat . there is no proper story of any kind , no characterization that makes the least bit of sense , and to top it off they go and beautiful milla 's face , as if she did n't look good enough ` ready . the sheer dumbness of this production is just off the scale . complete trash , waste of celluloid , time and people . and that 's the best i can say . spoilers ? this entire movie is a spoiler . a spoiler of life and time . avoid like the plague . ` tis the reign of resplendent incompetence . i have given a name to my pain , and it is resident evil : extinction .		2		0
it seems to me that reviewers fall into either of two categories - those who have read the book , and those who have n't . even allowing for the far-fetched coincidence of a malfunctioning orbital weapon that blinds everyone , and plants that seem to have everything but eyes -lrb- which they do n't need -rrb- ; john wyndham 's novel is a science fiction tour-de-force . in it he the possibility that the conquest of space would lead to weapons satellites , and that genetic engineering must eventually create monsters . ok ; the triffids were not actually products of ge , but you get the picture . the novel was written in 1951 . that 's 6 years before russia launched the first artificial satellite , sputnik . his analysis of human attitudes both before and after the catastrophe is sober , straightforward and astonishingly far-sighted . wyndham was a man who considered details and issues you just do n't . and it 's these thoughtful little analyses expressed in gripping dialogue that really are the bones of the book . add to them his powerful and emotive description and you have a classic novel to equal anything written by wells . now to the movie . wretched , botched , shallow , inept , clumsy , unispired , campy , comic crap . all of the meticulously analysed science-fiction was wrung out . the excellent original dialogue was shredded . and as to the plants ? i 've seen more frightening rhubarb . the lead character - mason - is inexplicably re-scripted from a triffid farmer to a sailor . this presumably helps to preclude all of the plant 's genesis and evolution detailed in the book . instead , they themselves appear to have arrived on the ` meteors ' , yet somehow survived atmospheric roasting . the scene where mason awakes in the chaotic hospital is quite well done - possibly because that comes from the original novel . but most of what follows afterwards is just banal . i can think of nothing to merit praise . script , lighting , acting , direction ; all belonged on the cutting-room floor . in ; yeah , sure . why did n't wyndham think of that ? drunken scientist working in a lighthouse with his long-suffering wife ? no reef 's complete without them . and so on . i would love to see a remake that paid closer attention to john 's style and thought . even 150 minutes would be acceptable if it was done really well , with good quality cgi . but this ? read the book . trust me ; read the book first . and i would also like to see a movie of the slower but much more sinister ` the kraken wakes ' . that would also be topical with melting ice-caps and rising so much in the news lately .		2		0
what a bad film this is . i thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren ` t battlefield earth is one of the worst films released by a major hollywood studio . it ` s badly directed , badly cast -lrb- barry pepper as jonnie makes for one of the least impressive screen hero ` s ever seen . maybe travolta should have stuck to his guns and played jonnie . he perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike pepper -rrb- and has one of the worst scripts ever written . an alien race called psychlos , sounds just like psychos , i bet they ` re really evil and cruel . oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it ` s the only thing they ` ve seen humans eat ? and why do they think '' rat brains '' is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the '' man animals '' to be a primitive species . and am i alone in finding the term '' man animals '' irritating ? surely it should be '' manimals '' ? a far sharper and clever expression . but sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! not only that but so do large amounts of firearms , ammo and harrier jump jets , and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week , and no doubt they ` ll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . does this sound very likely to you ? let me put it this way : go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times , capture a few dozen people , bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week . do you think they ` d be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? me neither . do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? me neither ? do you think anyone involved with this film deserves to work again ? me neither		2		0
star rating : ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning the movie claims the last publicised manned space craft mission to mars , apollo 17 , was in december of 1972 , but exactly a year later ` apollo 18 ' was sent to the moon under the nose of the unsuspecting american public , and indeed the world . but when this mission went wrong , and the astronauts found themselves stranded on a mars that appears to have been recently visited by the russians , the american government hung them out to dry , pursued in their isolation by a murderous alien force that wants to slay them off one by one . `` there 's a reason we 've never gone back to the moon '' the tag line on the poster to apollo 18 bellows , aiming for alien 's `` in space no one can hear you scream '' timeless immortality , and it 's certainly a worthy and effective effort that lures you in with the possibility of what may be . if apollo 13 had a problem , i guess these guys have got an emergency . sadly , it ends up serving only as a ` never judge a book by it 's cover ' lesson , as this is almost certainly the best thing about it . with a bit of cash in my pocket after christmas , i decided to do something i rarely do and buy a film before seeing it , only to waste # 10.99 . then again , i waste fifteen pound a month on lovefilm , so i know all about this . spanish -lrb- obviously ! -rrb- director gonzalo lopez-gallego has an intriguing and potentially very unnerving concept at hand here , but somehow fails to generate any sense of tension or suspense at the goings on with the americans on the moon , and failing to develop the characters in any way that makes us care about them or what becomes of them . unsurprisingly , with this in mind , it also fails to be scary or jump worthy in any way , with some kind of inter-galactic killer pursuing them that manages to stay very elusive . maybe it would have worked better had it not jumped on the easily blair witch band wagon and tried to generate more of an horizon type vibe . as it is , by the end it seems to have forgotten it was even meant to be a horror film , and ends as more of a documentary type expose of how the american government screws over it 's brave spacemen . if , as johnathan king sang , everyone 's gone to the moon , they 'll be having a boring time with apollo 18 going on . to see this kind of thing done better , seek out the far superior , under-rated event horizon . or alien . *		2		0
the story begins with abel turner -lrb- samuel l jackson -rrb- a cop that is a widower , raising two children . abel is very strict with his kids , and does not want anything to change . but things do when chris -lrb- patrick wilson -rrb- and lisa -lrb- kerry washington , best known from ray and i think i love my wife -rrb- an interracial couple that moves next door . abel in his own reasons , does not like them , and does things under handed to make there lives miserable there . chris and lisa are helpless to take action , because abel has n't been caught or even made threats that would hold him in court . so chris and lisa decide to fight fire with fire . samuel l. jackson is great but i feel as a villain in this film , he was n't very menacing to the point where you would consider him an inhuman monster , i felt he was just being himself for the most part . and that was not a good thing , they should have made him more scary . although jumper was not a good movie , he at least was a menacing bad guy in that movie . ray liotta was more scary in unlawful entry -lrb- 1992 -rrb- . patrick wilson and kerry washington are great and believable in there roles . but the rest of the film failed to have any thrills or suspense , and they call this a thriller . like i said why did n't anybody demand a rewrite ?		2		0
racism bad . woman good . knee-jerk conservatism bad . thoughtful liberalism good . one-dimensional people bad . two-dimensional people good . hate bad . art good . intolerance bad . change good . repression bad . sex good . fascism bad . freedom good . self-reflection good . blaming others bad . woman pretty . art pretty . flower pretty . book pretty . i am reminded of the tag line : do you get it ? i am appalled at the lack of ingenuity this movie shows . despite the hook - which gets tired very fast - this is a by-the-book hit piece for things that were very safe to hit . there is no cleverness in the script anywhere - nothing that sparks and makes you think . it hides behind the very -lrb- tired -rrb- images and dialogue that it wants to take down , and then it presents them as new a different . i am appalled that this movie pretends to be deep social commentary when it 's just trying to spoon-feed the viewer recycled material with a hook worthy of an `` i 'm dreaming '' episode of a tv sitcom . it 's like a salesman who steals your doormat and then tries to sell it to you because he knows it 's something you would buy . were the actors any good ? it 's hard to say because the script calls for them to act like they 're two-dimensional characters all the way through the movie - this includes all the and . on that score , they did perfectly well . leave this one on the shelf and watch edward scissorhands for a much better fairy tale with better sets , better direction , and a better script .		2		0
i went to see `` blue valentine '' based on some mostly positive reviews it received and this is a main reason why i do n't trust professional reviewers anymore . `` blue valentine '' is done in the `` mumblecore '' style of film making . the dialog appears to be improvised and the hand held camera makes it look like a documentary . that in itself would not normally doom a film , but the problem with `` blue valentine '' is that both characters are totally unlikable and we never really care about them . dean is an alcoholic high school dropout and cindy is a nurse who marries him because she ca n't do any better . the main problem with `` blue valentine '' is that it is extremely boring . it is like watching paint dry . if you like watching depressing lowlifes mumbling for 2 hours , you might like `` blue valentine . '' otherwise , be advised to stay away .		2		0
at pm while watching the movie i missed a phone call . my friend eleanor had given birth to a baby girl on the kitchen floor . the birth was a day early . eleanor 's partner lawrence had assisted , phone in hand to the emergency services , who gave step by step instructions . i missed the call due to being in my cuckoo land of choice , a.k.a. the cinema . at almost exactly that time i was watching an unrealistic ` birth ' in what could be a star trek episode on an unevolved planet , details like umbilical cords neatly censored out . occasionally the cast in those early tv shows would visit some primitive civilisation and observe the wacky beliefs of locals . except it was n't star trek . it was the nativity story , a lukewarm tale set in the middle east where a couple of women get pregnant and everyone is convinced no fornication has taken place . a story , accepted by millions of people as ` gospel ' , that has influenced history . the second baby is called jesus . his mother and adoptive father have been hearing voices and seeing visions . are prophesying a saviour for an oppressed populace , and three astrologers give weight to the sentiments and pronounce jesus a saviour . the enjoyment of the film rests largely on having subscribed to the beliefs in advance . as a story on its own merits , it is a flop . the most exciting action is when a snake spooks joseph 's donkey during a river crossing and mary falls off and gets wet . but for the faithful there is over a hundred minutes of soothing music -lrb- including gregorian chants and heavenly choirs -rrb- and a story everyone knows off by heart already - no big surprises there . released to coincide with seasonal spending sprees , it will help to float modern day ' coffers . it is a sermon that will encourage the warm fuzzies of spending and a brief period of goodwill to anyone who is on message . filmed in morocco and italy , it opens with prophecy from jeremiah : `` and israel will dwell securely . '' not securely enough for the film crew perhaps ? or was morocco just cheaper ? true , ` speaking peace unto the heathens ' goes on today , often backed up with military might -lrb- or , as the democrats might say , `` when clinton lied , nobody died . '' -rrb- however , the religious in the audience seemed to be in a happy daze afterwards -lrb- it took longer than usual to get to the exits -rrb- . it is almost like a genre in itself , where fans will accept anything with a donkey . the nativity story has reasonable production values taken in that spirit and my only misgiving is the ` pg ' certificate which will allow minors to be further brainwashed . speaking of which , remember to put your mince pies out for santa .		2		0
the hills have eyes is not a great film by any stretch of the one the villains look almost normal , not what you would expect deranged lunatics to look another the pacing is very slow at times and there are many scenes of the characters repeating that , i mean there is a lot of filler in the movie , with a lot of running around film did n't have a clear direction.the plot of the movie is hardly original , even for its time.the texas chainsaw massacre came out a few year earlier and is a much more effective film , as far as horror goes.the film has little in the way of scares , and the pounding soundtrack just served to be both grating and distracting all at once.i suppose the music was used to cover up the fact that not much happens through much of the movie , though it failed in its intended basically kept looking at the time every few seconds hoping something would happen or it would end . when something finally did happen any promise the film had was ruined by mere chaos and loud sat through it because i like to give a film the benefit of the , there is some loud screaming , and yes people die , but who too slow getting to any sort of pay off , if you can call it buddy enjoyed it , so at least one of us got something out of it.the hills have eyes is n't the worst film we could have watched , but i doubt i will watch it again.this film was remade in 2006 and i will also have review of that , this movie was painfully slow at times , while other times was chaotic and you like watching paint dry , occasionally interspersed with someone running around your block , screaming their head off , stay away from this movie.a better bet would be the original texas chainsaw massacre -lrb- 1973 -rrb- 1.5 * out of 10 * which is being generous		2		0
now , with daniel craig as bond , james bond , we are able to see how he fights with a terrorist banker . this time , bond is more violent as usual -lrb- brosnan refinement is dead -rrb- and it has lost all his charisma . craig -lrb- at least in this film -rrb- is not bond , he reminds more the anonymous character of `` transporter '' rather than bond . in addition , bond , must be a man of action , i can understand spending one hour in a poker match -lrb- well , it is well told -rrb- but , a bond movie must end with lots of fireworks , not with about one hour of nothing . i think daniel craig can be more brutal way of seeing bond , but the script of the film was not well done . there is no charismatic villain , it is much longer that it should be , as the ending is never-ending . in addition , there 's no feminine erotic views , only craig in shorts -lrb- what is bond without bond-girls ? -rrb- in order to make girls happier ... it is not that it is an awful movie -lrb- it could be much better if shorter , but is viewable -rrb- , it 's the fact that it is not a bond 's movie , just an action one . if you 're a purist , probably you 'll hate it , if not , it is just a bad movie .		2		0
`` around the world in 80 days '' recreates the sensation of looking through someone else 's vacation pictures . some of them may be pretty , but by the time you 've seen your fifth picture of palm trees and sand , you 're ready to move on . this movie existed solely as a big f *** you to the television industry and the threat it was making to film box office in the mid-50s . hollywood wanted to show what film could do that t.v. could n't , which meant big films in exotic locations on enormous screens . unfortunately , these added `` benefits '' came at the expense of just about everything else that makes films good -- pacing , character development , dramatic tension , etc. . david niven sleepwalks through this film , cantinflas is only slightly less irritating that roberto benigni , and spotting celebrity cameos may keep you interested for the first half hour , but they 're not the hook on which to hang a three-hour movie . think of all the things you could do in three hours and do any of them instead of watching this film . grade : d		2		0

the fast and the furious was no cinematic masterpiece . it was nowhere close to being worthy of a sequel . apparently the writers of this garbage did n't think so either , because they decided to write a bad story with bad dialogue , bad characters , and bad clichés . unfortunately , i ca n't blame the writers for the disgusting acting . 2 fast 2 furious follows officer brian o'conner as he is arrested for his illegal actions in the first film and is given an alternative to jail . he gets his record expunged if he goes undercover to take down a violent drug lord . as his partner , he chooses his old best friend roman pearce -lrb- played with 0 talent by tyrese gibson -rrb- . at least the fast and the furious had the redeeming quality of the action sequences for me to rate it a 5/10 . in 2 fast 2 furious , the action scenes are the same , and yet everything else is so bad that not even they can save this trash . i think the story -lrb- or lack thereof -rrb- and the terrible acting destroyed this already bound for failure sequel . i 'm actually at a loss for words at what else i can say . paul walker looks even more bored in this movie than he did in the first one . i 've seen him in other movies , he 's not terrible . did this hack director just tell him to suck or what ? tyrese should stick to pumping out his terrible rap songs instead of terrible movies . all in all , this movie just sucked . there 's nothing else to say . 2/10		2		0
a trainwreck of epic proportions , with almost no connection whatsoever to the first two films . superman has long had a cheesy side to him , it 's no secret , but in trying to that aspect of the character above all else , this stretches itself way , way too thin . if one were to remove the rich , interesting back-story from the first two films , cram every forced , campy slapstick pun into one long reel and inexplicably insert richard pryor at his mainstream worst , the final product would look startlingly similar to superman iii . the shameless luthor stand-in 's villainous plot is vacant and nonsensical , lois lane is written out after twelve lines , the man of steel himself is basically a supporting character , and both the central plot vehicle and the final battle are so far over the top they 've lost sight of the earth . the scenes are good for a laugh , if just in a `` wow , they actually filmed and released this '' manner , but otherwise it 's catastrophic , toilet bowl stinker .		2		0
trash ! i am using an american word because in this film they spoke in american accents ... when it is set in france ! honestly ! do n't people care about authenticity anymore ?! i would give it one star but it 's surprisingly good storyline allows it to be given another star . logan lerman as d'artagnan is the major anchor in the cause for this film to stop becoming a good film ! with his fake looking wig , he brings the most unashamedly american attitude to the film when he is meant to be a humble french farmer boy in search of becoming a hero ! all the actors managed to deliver such cheesy and disgraceful lines which could destroy ones careers ! using words like `` cocky '' and a couple of swear words was just stupid since they would n't have used words like those back in the day ! the only stand out performance was james corden ... now that says something about the quality of the film ! but like i said before , the storyline makes you at least want to stay until the end of the film . in a period drama piece you either use english accents or english language with a french accent ! not with an american accent !!! they could have done a much better job , the story was there but the acting and scriptwriting was not		2		0
this has to be one of the worst films ever made . quentin tarantino 's script was butchered beyond all recognition and this was the outcome . it is trippy , sick , boring and all in all complete crap from the beginning to the end . even david lynch 's involvement could have improved this mess ! . rightly banned for a while in the uk although it should have been , not for its explicit violence , but to spare the public from such an awful waste of time , effort and money . it seems fitting that its uk tv debut was on channel 5 !!!!!!		2		0
this was pretty obviously the product of a of media folks who have more budget than vision . i really can see it ; they just consulted a list of recent moneymaker subgenres , picked two of them -lrb- from a hat ? -rrb- , then retained a hack writer to knock out a hybrid script . y ' know , there 's really not much more you can say , once you 've nailed down that essential thing . i guess i could say that it 's sad to think of folks who 've sort of settled into a lifestyle of producing this kind of schlock ; they rest comfortable in the knowledge that they can plug into a system that rewards modest efforts with cash . of course , the buck can be reasonably passed to a passive consuming public , which does n't expect its movies to be truly wonderful , let alone trenchant or even prophetic ... or even , really , actually funny . as long as people continue to treat a night out at the movies as a time-killer , we will continue to have movies like apollo 18 .		2		0
-lrb- r # 31 -rrb- how can a movie be hyperactive , slick and flashy , yet boring , mind-numbing and comatose at the same time ? well , however lee tamahori -lrb- you know , the guy who introduced to the bond franchise -rrb- does it , he does it good : `` xxx - squared , ! '' is mindless , meaningless and utterly unenjoyable junk from start to finish . ice cube as an action hero ? hmm , yeah , why not . maybe for the next sequel , we could get or anthony anderson to star ? cube is one dull guy to root for and the fact that the script is void of anything remotely funny or witty does n't help . samuel l. jackson and willem dafoe ? what the hell are they even doing in here ? were they doped up , or did they simply not read the script before signing on ? one thought jackson would have learned something from the first movie , but no : he 's back , and more pointless than ever . dafoe is a talented actor but this movie gives him absolutely nothing to work with as the `` bad guy '' . a pointless xzibit thrown in is just icing on the cake -lrb- if by `` icing '' you mean `` strong indian spices '' and by `` cake '' you mean `` open wound '' -rrb- . there 's no plot worth mentioning and the action blows . despite a high pace , endless attempts at humour and lots of stereotypes -lrb- for instance , all black people are badass characters while all the whiteys are stiff senators or gay computer hackers - however did they come up with this stuff ? genius i tell you ! -rrb- , xxx2 manages to , somehow , be less entertaining and even a tad bit worse than its predecessor . how anything could top that vin garbage heap is beyond me . congratulations lee tamahori - you blow chunks !		2		0
pretty awful movie about a young man -lrb- johnny knoxville of `` jackass '' `` fame '' -rrb- who needs to make big cash to help a friend who lost his fingers in a lawn mowing accident . his sleazy uncle gets an idea to get a piece of the action in having his nephew pretend to be a mentally challenged person and then gain admission into the special olympics to claim the prize money . i am actually surprised this movie got made and released at all , given how uptight the politically correct world is today . truthfully though , i was hoping it would be at least funny in the daring way a film like borat had been , and it 's not very . among the cast are some mentally challenged actors . edward , an actor with down syndrome , is quite good in his part . a couple of the other performers struck me as ordinary people pretending to be handicapped , but i could be mistaken . i could n't take my eyes off that adorable katherine heigl , who i fell in love with recently after seeing knocked up , and who plays a counselor here working with the `` special people '' . this would have easily ranked a zero for me if not for her cuteness .		2		0
it 's always interesting to watch james dean act . i mean , the man was good , not just some teen heart-throb ... but most of the characters in this film were just plain annoying to make the film enjoyable . dean and natalie wood 's parents were either way too wimpy or nasty . while dean 's character was okay , the other kids in the film , led by wood , were obnoxious and horrible people . sal mineo 's role was kind of strange in that , even though he was the same age as dean , he was the little brother here who idolizes dean . it did n't quite fit . in the end , watching two hours of stupid parents and unlikable juvenile delinquents is not my idea of fun and entertainment and `` cause '' enough never to watch this overrated teen angst mess again .		2		0
i realize that many may love this film for the impressive sounds that both fred astaire and judy garland create together . i must admit , there was quite a bit of singing and dancing to demonstrate this karmic connection that these two had together . honestly , i would like to admit that there was just a bit too much singing and dancing in this film . easter parade was nothing except a showcase that allowed astaire to prove himself to audiences again and again , while garland attempt to counter her wizard of oz persona that followed her until her bittersweet end . musicals are a tough genre to create . you , as a director , need to have a concrete balance between the song/dance routines and the physical plot , which keeps the audience watching until the very end . i have seen musicals fail and succeed because the director had that bond secured . sadly , easter parade 's director , charles walters , did not have a strong enough grip on the two . instead of a good story , with emotional characters , and a sincere plot , we are forced to watch garland and astaire seemingly attempt to continually outdo themselves on screen . there was no chemistry between the two , there was no logical plot to this story , and finally , there was no emotion . i cared nothing for anyone in these performances because i was time and time again with dance , song , and meaningless clichés , which seemed to be the overall theme of this film . judy garland and fred astaire fans out there are not going to enjoy what i am about to say . this being my first fred astaire picture watched , i must admit i was not impressed . astaire did nothing to develop his character throughout the film . while i do agree that it is the job of the director to create these lines , astaire should have done something instead of prance around hoping to carry this film on just the weight of his feet . as i watched easter parade , i could n't help but think of astaire as this manipulator towards his own common good . i saw him as this evil man who wanted nothing more than to be successfully , but was not willing to do it on his own . from the opening scenes in this film , where it is obvious that he loves the camera on him , to the moments where he is on stage proving that he is the top dog in dance and song . perhaps i misread this film , but i saw astaire as this guy who had relationship issues . he was n't interested in actually falling in love , but did n't want to loose his partner again . his character don was determined to be the best in the business , and he did n't care whom he was partnered with which allowed him to reach that goal . you could see that when he showed minimal emotion towards nadine when they parted , and how unemotional he because during all of his scenes with garland . there was absolutely no chemistry between these two actors . i believe the age difference to be the biggest hurdle , but the fact that when they gazed into each other 's eyes nothing pulled me , demonstrated how poorly the director chose on this film . you could tell that walters wanted two big names to anchor this film because he did n't have the glue to keep it together himself . coupled with the fact that johnny was the most random character witnessed in cinematic history also hurt the overall emotional effect of the film . what was johnny 's relationship with nadine ? it felt like whatever was available , these two men ran towards , without any emotion or sympathy for anything . it was disastrous . not only was the acting enough to be scoffed at , but the plot ... well ... was completely missing . there were minor threads of plot dangling throughout the film like the dysfunctional wardrobe that garland wore during one of the dance sequences . that dress completely represented the direction of this film . the dress itself was the actual plot , while the falling pieces of fabric represented the audience being tossed about and thrown on the floor in hopes to reconnect with the dress again sometime during the performance . alas , we never did . due to the plot , we jumped , literally , from emotion to emotion , never quite sealing a secure moment throughout . one scene we are trying to connect with johnny and hannah , the next with hannah and don , then there is nadine and hannah , or was it johnny , and what about don and nadine ? jump . jump . jump . it became obviously clear that walters knew that this was a flimsy plot and instead of fixing it , pushed more song and dance into the film to attempt to cover the soiled sections . it did not work . our flimsy characters , no matter how well their singing , could not conceal this broken direction that walters obviously lost control of . finally , there were the songs . decent numbers , but just too many . what was the infamous `` easter parade '' ? you would think that a film that chose to have this as their title would explain the ritual a bit further . sure , there was a song , but i kept watching astaire jump around so often that the dizziness caused me to miss the lyrics of the songs . walter 's needed to take a page from a true musical like singing in the rain to show him how to correctly combine a great plot with some great songs ! overall , i did n't like this film . i needed better characters , stronger stories , and the director to just tighten down on this runaway balloon . i think if you saw astaire at a bar today , looking like he did in easter parade , the first words out of your mouth would be `` glen quagmire '' . he looked like an utter sleaze that preyed on young women , but maybe it was astaire just trying to stay with his character ! grade : * out of *****		2		0
this movie has a space voyage and once again stryker is back flying it with his woman now involved with a new man and he knows this new beau of hers is no good . the movie is a parody mostly of concord : airport 79 although it does n't say that on here . this movie was short on laughs and the writers from part one claim to have never seen it and were extremely against it . it was a flop for good reason as it was short on laughs and it 's best parts were actually a bunch of parodies from part 1 , replicating them almost exact in many ways . it did have a few parodies of other films such as star wars , star trek , obviously the airport films , mission : impossible , the love boat -lrb- even having the great jack jones singing the theme -rrb- , there is a funny poster of rocky 38 , very obvious references to hal from 2001 : a space odyssey and much more . ken finkleman wrote and directed and he did n't do a great job at either . acting wise we had robert hayes and julie hagarty back on lead . bridges and peter graves reprised their roles and we had great new people on board like william shatner -lrb- who was the best thing and funniest guy on the film -rrb- , sonny bono , rip torn , chuck conners and raymond burr -lrb- as the judge -rrb- . the film also had small roles for people like george wendt , joyce dewitt -lrb- uncredited as a juror -rrb- , sam anderson , pat and john vernon . stephen was back as the annoying gay guy and i hated his character on both . the movie just was n't that funny , it had some laughs but they were few and far between , it 's hard to set through , every time i have watched it i found myself losing interest . 2/10 stars .		2		0
wow ! what an assault on the senses . not only does the movie feel like you just got hit really hard in the head , and you 're now seeing the world through brain damage , but it 's also unbelievably preachy and boring . it reminds me of a type of conversation you would have with someone high on a narcotic . `` wow man , what if none of this is real , man . what if we 're all like in a dream world , man .

` celebrity , ' written and directed by woody allen , is one of his most anxious , neurotic , works ever , and he even includes what can be construed as a disclaimer of sorts : the scene is the screening of a new film by an director , whom someone refers to as pretentious ; his movie is shot in black & white and is apparently self-serving and self-indulgent . this film by allen is shot in black & white , is pretentious , self-serving and self-indulgent . there is a story in here somewhere that seeks to explore the nature and effects of fame , but toward that end the viewer is subjected to a vast array of unsympathetic characters , mediocre performances and a lot of endless stammering and hand wringing . kenneth branagh should be happy with this one , however , because for him there is no place to go from here but up ; this is far and away the nadir of his film career . he plays lee simon , a writer , a role written by allen obviously with himself in mind , and branagh does little more with it than give a woody allen impersonation throughout the entire movie . inexplicably , he fails to create any semblance of an original character , so caught up apparently with ` doing woody , ' and the result is a ridiculous caricature that lacks any credibility and is annoying in the extreme . how a terrific actor like branagh , with so many personal tools at his disposal , could produce such a pretentious portrait is beyond comprehension . judy davis comes off looking bad as well ; playing essentially the same type of role as she did in allen 's ` deconstructing harry ' -lrb- which she pulled off so well -rrb- , she has been ` ' in this one , taking her character of robin -lrb- lee 's wife -rrb- to a extreme . watching such a gifted actress give such a performance is almost beyond endurance . also wasted in this film are the talents of hank azaria , leonardo dicaprio , melanie griffith , famke janssen , and michael lerner . the only actors who managed to keep their heads above water in this one were joe mantegna -lrb- as tony , the only character you could come close to caring anything about -rrb- , bebe neuwirth -lrb- as a hooker -rrb- , winona ryder -lrb- as an aspiring actress -rrb- and charlize theron , who was probably the most memorable , in a convincing turn as a supermodel . allen has made some great films over the years , but unfortunately ` celebrity ' is n't one of them . this is vapid drivel that will do little more than leave you jittery and have you reaching for the tablets . i rate this one 2/10 .		2		0
-lrb- george , is it you clicking those `` no '' votes ? his cousin ? friends ? bored fans ? -rrb- george clooney 's pathetic directorial debut . does clooney actually believe in 's story ? if he does , then he must be an even bigger moron than i thought he was . clooney , the world-famous mediocre actor , found his head high up in the clouds one day and decided that he would like to be a mediocre director as well . he almost succeeded : the movie is n't mediocre ; it is terrible . why would clooney think he 's `` brilliant '' enough to be a director ? perhaps it 's a result of long-term yes-men kissing his behind , world-wide adoration , plus taking in too many drugs . his already huge ego has obviously been inflating even more recently , because as of the 21st century he has decided to become a world-saving wannabe , much like that poser bono or that imbecile chris martin . clooney 's irrelevant little advice and suggestions about sudan are soooooooo useful . talk about an uneducated , misinformed , bird-brained little nepotistic actor -lrb- his parents were show-biz hot-shots , too -rrb- playing the role of the `` wise man '' who has all the answers to the world 's ills . a jackass right out of the textbook . as if the story in were n't laughable enough , with its pitiful based-on-fact pretensions , clooney had to make things even worse by casting the overly goofy sam rockwell to play . now , you 'll rarely come across a man as annoying as s.r. : the incessant mugging , the idiotic grins , the way he talks - all he does seems to almost be done on purpose to be annoying , and he does this in most of his movies . having drew barrymore and clooney himself in this mess only makes things worse ... clooney plays a cia man with such robotic lack of conviction that his character comes off more like a very bad stereotype than a person who really existed . the story is absurd , the `` humour '' unfunny , and the film is quite dull in the second half . is only an introduction into the world of `` clooney cinema '' , which turned out to be a series of leftist propaganda films , i.e. cretinous nonsense , which will convert only the most ignorant of viewers , or merely preach to the converted . that ridiculous sci-fi/fantasy , `` syriana '' , which he later made confirms this 100 % . clooney does n't understand either the cia , politics , history , al-qaida , or anything else relevant to making such movies . and yet he has a world-wide voice , appearing even on cnn and other news channels where he spouts off his empty-headed views . just goes to show what a sad age we live in . i think clooney and paris hilton should have kids : we do n't have enough kids on this miserable planet . if you 're interested in seeing my extensive hollywood nepotism list , contact me by e-mail . or you can go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~fedor8 and check out my `` tv & cinema : 150 worst cases of nepotism '' list . this review is dedicated to clooney 's dead pig . poor thing ...		2		0

i am not too particular about james bond anyway , but someone did recommend casino royale to me . i 've always seen james bond as a shallow pretty boy european that gets the woman and the bad guy . this movie i stopped 20 minutes in though . my reasoning for turning it off will not resonate with some if not most of you , nor do i expect it to , but it is my review and my opinion . the fact is , i have a particular abhorrence of movies in which a white man goes into africa and snatches black people , whether the said african is a criminal or not . call it a historical sore spot but i just did n't like it . it would be an egregious crime against humanity if an african marched into england or america shooting up white people just to apprehend a criminal .		2		0
this very short sci-fi film is pretty forgettable . it tells the story of a who is busted out of prison by a criminal mastermind . a subservient scientist is forced to experiment on the safe-cracker , turning him invisible ; from this position the thief can effectively rob banks . the master criminal , meanwhile , dreams of creating an invisible army . there are some reasonable effects on display here . but any film that features an invisible man as its centre-piece has its work cut out keeping things interesting . invisible actions are n't a recipe for cinematic gold . and in this instance we have props on wires , invisible fights and , best of all , an invisible guinea pig . it 's all a bit tedious really but clocking in at under an hour it is n't too painful .		2		0
-lsb- contains spoilers -rsb- the place is new york and the time is in the 1960 's . nyu student fritz the cat and his buddies are playing music in the park when fritz sees three attractive young women . he coaxes them into coming with him to a party in a pad across town . people there were making love , drinking and doing drugs . fritz and the girls climb into the bath tub and proceed to make love simultaneously . just then , two bumbling pig cops break in . by then , everybody from the party had joined in the bath tub , leaving fritz bored . the cops burst in and busted everybody . luckily fritz escaped but the cops chased him to a . -lrb- is that how you spell it ? -rrb- . after that he went back to nyu and had had his fill of the way things were in the world so he set his text books as well as the whole school on fire and raced off to harlem . the town was full of black crows . he befriended one playing pool . the two leave together and `` borrow '' a car that had its keys in it . fritz took the wheel and they drove like crazy all over town . they go to the crows ' friends ' house where they shove a number of joints into his mouth and he begins to trip out and go at one of the big female crows . the same two cops from before arrive and by then , fritz had them rally at a revolution . a huge riot breaks out . much blood is shed . fritz 's crow friend is killed . fritz rushes off to the docks to meet with one of his old lady friends and together they drive out of town . just to let you know : it 's not old lady friend as in senior citizen , but old as in one of his old friends . anyway , en route they 're nearly run over by big rigs and soon the car runs out of gas . fritz goes to find more when he meets a psychotic neo-nazi rabbit and his horse girlfriend . he joins them to a party in the woods run by a slug in a cloak and a deranged lizard . the rabbit proceeded to beat his girlfriend with a chain while the lizard aimed to `` ride that horse '' . the lizard planned to blow up the power plant and talked fritz into helping . it was then , seconds before the power plant exploded , that fritz realized that the love you make is equal to the love you take so in the end , he cast out violence and hate , but still embraced sex . well , what can i say ? this has to be the most bizarre movie i have ever seen . a little too weird for my taste . i just saw it because i was always curious about it . but this is no saturday morning cartoon ! it 's an x-rated romp about the twisted side of life in the 1960s with animals playing people parts . it seemed as though fritz was the only character to have a name . when this movie was over , i wondered , `` what in the **** did i just see ? '' so honestly , i do n't recommend fritz the cat , but if you like the work of ralph bakshi then you should see it or you like x-rated films then to you i would recommend this film , though i must warn you : it 's got strong language , heavy violence , heavy sex and shots of genitalia and urination and strange , psychedelic images . but if that floats your boat , it 's for you ! -		2		0
to understand how bad this movie is to compare it to a great movie . `` a nightmare on elm street '' one has a great concept and original story ... the other does not . one has terrific pacing and true terror ... the other does not . one is a must-watch by any movie lover ... the other is not .		2		0

for some , i can see why this is a classic , however for me , not only did i find it painfully slow for the first forty minutes , but a little disgusting at times as well . it 's more than definitely a guy movie , and would never even dare to be called a ` chick flick ' . robert de niro was fine , however i think he tends to play the same role for every movie he 's ever been in . jennifer connely was great , playing the young love interest of deniro 's character , however again , is it really necessary to subject young children of that age to nudity ? there were some sex scenes that could have been done without , and although they have been needed for the film , they still could have presented them a little more tactfully . i found it strange , to be honest , and i do n't normally say that about dramas like these . i would n't recommend it . it 's not worth your time .		2		0

this is exactly what hollywood excels in and a good reason why i spend most of my viewing time watching independent and foreign films . once again you have to scratch your head and wonder why some over paid studio executive green lighted this project . story is about a family that is stressed out with living in the city and decide to pack up their bags and live in the quiet countryside . cooper tilson -lrb- dennis quaid -rrb- discovers a rundown manor that is huge and affordable and he does n't waste any time buying it and moving his wife leah -lrb- sharon stone -rrb- and their two kids into it . everything seems fine and cooper is ready to hire some guys to help renovate it when dale massie -lrb- stephen dorff -rrb- pops up out of nowhere and tells them that he was the previous owner and needs a job . ***** spoiler alert ***** cooper learns that dale has just gotten out of prison but decides to hire him to fix the swimming pool but right after that several strange things start happening like snakes invading the house and dale always snooping around . cooper loves the house and decides to make a documentary about it 's history and he goes to visit dale 's father -lrb- christopher plummer -rrb- who is in an old folks home . after the incident with the snakes dale is fired but he keeps pestering cooper and his family until cooper discovers why he wo n't leave and it has to do with what is hidden in the `` devils throat '' . this film is directed by mike figgis who is very talented -lrb- internal affairs , leaving las vegas -rrb- but most of the films he makes have small budgets and the only reason i can think of for him to direct a by the numbers thriller is for money . could he really have read this script and seen potential in it ? films cost money to make , even low budget ones and i think figgis pocketed whatever the studio gave him so that he could finance his next project . i 'm not sure what quaid was thinking , maybe working with a director like figgis who is very respected . there is absolutely no surprises in this script and once dorff barges into the home of quaid it 's evident as to what happens next . this is your standard hollywood actioneer that wants to be suspenseful but instead evokes both chuckles and yawns . even a reliable actor like quaid is forced to act like a buffoon and it 's hard to stifle a laugh when he 's supposed to be scared silly of snakes . this is a film that has no imagination and no intention of being something special so what 's left is an excuse by hollywood to try and take your money so that in the end they can make a buck .		2		0
is simply a remarkable film - captivating the soul and essence of the entire population of the globe . all several billions of them . this is a story of sheer depth and coming to grips with understanding for the people who bring forth a presence that beckons the yearning of something more . a passion if you will - a passion for the just and honour - in all it 's forms . the entire structure of this fine developed film is that the beauty of love - herein described as simply put - lust uninhibited will prove that beyond our inhibitions , there is something more ... something giving and true that will embrace the world with all it 's splendour and truth . feel emotion come from your inner reaches as the dialogue spark such insight and inspiration to bring on such presence that only a true artist speaking such words can emote . what you have here in story blends with true realism that not only is the words spoken pure fulfilment to the ears , but also the carefully constructed acting techniques and filming styles immerse you into something so deep and centred that to not see this in it 's entirety is simply to miss out on a masterpiece . when the story offers such soul gripping and heart stopping emotions , one can not help but to be fully captivated by it 's focus on characterization and belief of integrity and moral values . the characters here offer and define those expectations and more - if not only for the story but also to develop a sense of truth about what we as a people shall value in it 's entirety . every moment of this film is pure magic and the simple shred of light that shines from the darkest corner offers a spark unknown but to anybody but the viewer when encapsulated by this brave new story which unfolds before you . to mark this as possibly the best film one could ever see would be an understatement of enormous proportions when nobody can ever the quality in any other movie as this has . yet another film feature with seth rogan as a well mannered and schooled young man who can teach us not only wisdom , but also the finer details about life and all it has to offer .		2		0
it 's not so much the fact that the villains can read minds . -lrb- reflect on how bad jeff bridges is at hiding his thoughts , and you 'll realise there 's nothing mysterious about this . -rrb- it 's the way that they can predict behaviour with a pin-point accuracy ... and not just behaviour , but everything else besides . the villains can predict what the traffic will be like , whether or not it will be raining when they want it not to be raining , and how quickly , to within a small fraction of a second , security guards and casual passers by will be able to react . well , this is what happens when the writers want to have it both ways . they try to generate tension but underlining how contingent everything is - if only he 'd arrived at the traffic light just an instant earlier , they want us to think - but then they try to shock us by telling us that every tiny cough had been carefully planned . had the film been less dull i would n't have minded so much . i spent most of my time trying to work out why i was so profoundly uninterested , for the film is n't bad in any obvious way . well , perhaps one : the central character is just so unappealing . who cares if he lives or dies ? he 's scarcely alive to begin with . -lrb- added to this , he has to be the very worst lecturer i have ever seen , in fiction or in reality , and i have given this matter some thought . -rrb- he suspects his neighbours of being terrorists but since we do n't find out until the end what dastardly deed , if any , these ` terrorists ' are plotting , we ca n't really involve ourselves in that side of the story , either . there are other things to send us to sleep . pellington does n't believe in cluttering the frame . no , that 's an understatement . he believes in leaving the frame so clinically bare that it 's like staring at a dentist 's ceiling for two hours . the sound track consists largely of rumblings and thuds taking place at a frequency of about twenty hertz , as of a clearing its throat . whenever anything happens pellington drops a steel girder onto our heads from a great height to make sure we noticed . ... now that i come to think of it , the silly twist at the end is the least of our problems : if i 'd been given a chance , i would probably have enjoyed it .		2		0
like michael myers , the `` halloween '' franchise lumbers on long after you wish it would drop dead , growing increasingly ridiculous as it goes along . `` halloween ii '' was a thrill for fans of the original because it literally gave us more of the same , although it left laurie strode in a catatonic state for most of the film and giving us boring nurses and orderlies for the wandering shape to play `` stalk & slash '' with . 4-6 painted themselves into a corner with a storyline that attempted to explain michael myers , who was so scary because he could n't be explained . part 7 reintroduced curtis to the series by wisely jettisoning the ludicrous sequels and taking its history from the original and `` halloween 2 '' , giving us a neurotic laurie strode finally having to face the shape after 20 years of paranoia . the foolish `` h20 '' moniker could almost be forgiven , and the brisk pacing made it easy to overlook the silliness of the whole thing and focus on the excitement , culminating when laurie lops off her boogeyman brother 's head with an axe once and for all . now this . in an introductory explanation that would n't get by on an episode of `` scooby doo '' , we are informed that michael myers stealthily crushed the larynx of a convenient paramedic , and then switched outfits with him . it was this paramedic that laurie hauled off with at the end of `` h20 '' . it was all a big mistake and the real michael myers got away , while laurie was sent directly to the booby hatch for chopping off his head . although she does not speak anymore , laurie secretly dodges her meds -lrb- the nurses never notice -rrb- , and when mr. shape inevitably returns to claim her , she is ready . laurie has somehow even set up an elaborate trap for him on the roof of the asylum , involving a snare built out of a garage door opener -lrb- where she got these elements we can only wonder -rrb- . but it 's all for nothing -- she falls for a big and dies , getting a knife in her gut and falling off the roof . at this point , `` halloween : resurrection '' could end . unfortunately , there are still about 75 minutes left to the film . director rick rosenthal , who directed `` halloween ii '' , manages to elicit zero chills in this one . the atmosphere of dread that is essential to the success of a horror film is absolutely missing . not only that , but the plot is just plain stupid . a group of beautiful young people is gathered in the myers home on halloween night as part of an internet stunt conceived by busta rhymes . i doubt you will remember anybody 's name after the credits roll . the roles are thankless and the scant amount of personality that the actors manage to inject is quickly exhausted . they wander around the myers house -lrb- locked in , of course -rrb- with grainy cameras on their heads so that we can be reminded of `` blair witch project '' . then they are murdered . some of the early murders even manage to go unnoticed , despite the fact that ... well gee , the house ca n't be that big , can it ? think of your own house . would n't it be real obvious if some screaming person were being hacked to death in the kitchen ? the myers house looks almost nothing like it has in the previous films . we also learn that there is apparently a labyrinthine series of tunnels underneath haddonfield , which can be accessed through portals in the basements of the homes . kind of makes the plot of `` jason x '' seem a little more plausible , right ? no tension is generated in the film , partly because of the mtv-style editing that obscures the details of the action , and indeed it looks just like a direct-to-video outing . it 's even got a groveling television audio mix , where everything is underscored with constant rumbling , spooky music . then there are the clanking knife sound effects . how can a single knife make a sound like two knives being rubbed together ? this movie does not take place in anybody 's reality . they might as well have made it an animated feature . the best thing `` halloween : resurrection '' has going for it is some unintentional humor -lrb- the campy shots that highlight the bloody tip of myers 's butcher knife -rrb- and some amusing references to the earlier films . the actors are powerless to get this dead horse to bolt . busta rhymes reveals that he 's no ice-t , and features in one of the movie 's most embarrassing sequences : when he fights michael myers with kung fu moves . in fact , all of the roles in this film appear tacked on and contrived . case in point : tyra banks 's do-nothing role that centers on her wiggling butt and her prowess with a coffee machine . she is so expendable that even her death occurs offscreen . while it was no masterpiece , `` h20 '' still carried some curiously powerful imagery , especially in the climactic confrontation where laurie decapitates the shape , pausing beforehand to reach out for its hand in an eerily compelling moment . to buy into this film 's mythology is to defuse the last good thing about the `` halloween '' series . i ai n't buying it . i know `` halloween '' fans will see this movie , just like i did , meaning that the only resurrection going on here is that of moustapha akkad 's bank account . now that laurie strode is gone from the series , taking the last shred of interest with her , i seriously doubt if even `` halloween '' fans will go to see the excruciatingly inevitable `` halloween 9 '' . unless , of course , we learn that it was not laurie strode who plummeted over the side of the building , but rather a cleverly disguised female orderly in a rubber jamie lee curtis mask . with her larynx crushed , of course .		2		0
`` wild , wild west '' could have been a good film . it had great stars and a great director . so what happened ? bad script . usually this kills a film . you could make a television show out of it : `` when bad scripts happen to good films . '' will smith plays west , and kevin kline plays gordon -lrb- as well as the president -rrb- . the two of them have to learn how to get along as they try to stop loveless -lrb- kenneth branagh -rrb- from killing the president and taking over the united states . the special effects and gadgets -lrb- loveless 's spider devices are pretty cool -rrb- , but they only serve to remind you that this could have been a good film . the women in the film -lrb- salma hayek , for example -rrb- are seen as just sex objects . hayek seems to be in the film just to cause friction between smith and kline . one more thing : am i the only one to be disturbed by smith in drag ?		2		0
karen sets out for africa to marry bror blixen -lrb- strangely enough that name means brother flash in danish , i thought she was off to marry her brother ! -rrb- when she meets denys -lrb- robert redford -rrb- . she marries bror and the two have this very strange relationship . their most romantic scene : bror : after sex `` i like you . . '' karen : `` i like you too ... '' and the two had now been married for a while ! bror prefers to spend time away from karen . she is deeply disturbed by that and then ends up getting syphilis . she goes back to denmark and returns again unable to have children . with her husband always away denys steps in and suddenly the two get involved . where was the attraction ? he too likes to spend his time away , he buys a plane and just sets off in it every 5 seconds . he even moves in with her yet he still is n't there at all except for the small moments when the two have dull conversations . she gets her divorce from bror and learns that denys is n't interested in marriage in fact he just wants to be free ... and then he tells her he loves her ... do n't worry the whole movie just keeps going downhill right from the beginning ... personally i would watch the thorn birds with richard chamberlain and rachel ward 100 times to see what passion and attraction is al about rather to ever watch this movie again . the movie was over 2 hours and it started out dull and ended dull . there was a huge lack of emotions and meryl streep had a terrible accent ! her accent was not . 2/10 only because it seemed heaven lost a perfect angel and that angel was robert redford ! yet even then the end is terrible so do n't bother renting this movie , if you want to watch it , who knows it might just turn up on tv .		2		0
black holes . they sound pretty spooky , right ? you ca n't see inside one because light ca n't escape and that , in turn , is because we 're not entirely sure whether the laws of physics hold within them . the event horizon , on the other hand is that bit where you can just about see the edge of a black hole , its slippery lip . things are just about normal but could descend into mind-boggling lunacy . naturally , paul andersen ca n't resist nudging his own film off over the horizon 's edge . i think the bit where irony grips is the ` latin quotation ' shot . not only is it laughable but watching with a more critical eye to the film you have to ask , why latin ? did someone 's interface get suspended along with the laws of physics ? there 's plenty of money on the screen in cast and effects -lrb- although not quite enough of the latter -rrb- . but it 's a daft film and ultimately because it does n't have anything to do with it 's own title . 2/10		2		0
there are mass murderers and former dictators rotting away in prison cells who have done better for the human condition than author , nicholas sparks . if nicholas sparks was a conflict he would be the hundred years war ; if he were a baseball team he would be the 1962 new york mets ; if he were a boxer he 'd be jerry quarry . since 2004 's `` the notebook , '' which at least earned praise for the inclusion of veteran stars james garner and gena rowlands , but catcalls for ryan gosling and rachel mcadams -lrb- at least gosling has become a better actor since -rrb- , sparks has become the antithesis to romantic dramas and to good film , in general . follow-ups such as `` dear john , '' `` the last song '' and `` the lucky one , '' have all gotten progressively -lrb- or even exponentially -rrb- worse . that pattern continues with his latest valentine 's day release , `` safe haven , '' which is nothing more than `` sleeping with the enemy '' meets `` the lucky one . '' in fact , during this picture i quietly prayed for zac efron to appear and make everything better again . directed by lasse hallström -lrb- the man behind such quality productions as `` my life as a dog , '' `` what 's eating gilbert grape '' and `` the cider house rules '' -rrb- , this picture has a woman on the run trying to hide her identity but stumbles upon love in an unbelievably bucolic north carolina fishing village . katie -lrb- `` rock of ages '' julianne hough , as in `` hough '' did she get up on the big screen ? answer , she 's living with ryan seacrest -- talk about sleeping one 's way to the bottom -rrb- flees a murder rap in boston in a bus and is trying to avoid a psycho police office -lrb- david lyons , `` eat pray love '' -rrb- . conveniently , she settles in south point where few people speak , with the exception of general store owner alex -lrb- josh duhamel , `` transformers '' franchise -rrb- , a widower with a cute , ready-made hollywood family -lrb- including the robotic kid actor who was so bad in `` playing for keeps '' -rrb- . he is smitten , but she 's a cold fish -lrb- remember , she has `` secrets '' that we know about , but alex does not -rrb- . he makes small talk , she ignores it , he gives her a bicycle , she can not accept it , etc. , etc. , etc. . but of course , since this is a nicholas sparks ' adaptation , you know love -- and a certain amount of lust -- is just lurking around the corner . soon , she discovers what a wonderful , caring , handsome man he is -- and he loves children , to boot . alex is , after all , a '90s woman . in the third act , though , we know a certain cop will show up to add what little drama his arrival can add to a film like this and it takes a plot twist from the planet pluto to save the day . it has been said that sparks -lrb- who now boasts his own production company , so the `` fun '' will continue for years to come -rrb- has trouble writing men , but can certainly capture women . after `` safe haven , '' i can honestly say he can not write anyone . his latest effort is schmaltzy , predictable , clichéd to the point of absurdity , and has no chemistry whatsoever between his good-looking leads . in fact , now that i think about it , `` safe haven '' actually is the perfect valentine 's day date movie -- provided , of course , that you and your date avoid it at all costs .		2		0
i only watched this because for about forty years i have seen it listed among science fiction movies . yes one reviewer said it was made for kids . that 's true . others were made for adults . however , bad is bad . who the film was directed at is of no consequences . i would suspect short attention spans , would last about five minutes . it 's just a rambling mess of mistaken identity and ridiculous situations , going nowhere . santa is ok in his ho , ho , ho , sort of way , but he even looks bored and confused at times . he is brought to mars to get the kids to focus on more traditional martian values or something . they are watching too much tv , i guess . but the pitfalls are that the martians are so uninteresting . earthlings with shoe polish on their faces -- it even rubs off at times . there is the obligatory bad guy . i guess he 's on a power trip because what difference does it all make ? the title is really the best part of the movie .		2		0
although advertised as a complete action movie , it is n't . in fact it mostly a dialogue driven part thriller that achieves very little . supposedly this is mel gibson 's vintage return back into the movie world , but by time the closing credits emerge , you would have expected a lot more from gibson . from the list of some of his past movies -lrb- braveheart and mad max -rrb- you would have thought after a seven year absence from acting that he would have learnt more and developed , but he has n't . the action is limited , believe me . if you go in with the expectation of an all-out guns blazing action movie then your seeing the wrong film . do n't get me wrong the violence is pretty brutal , and despite over quickly , it does , in some way leave it 's impact on you . there is one scene that will have you jumping out of your skin because of it 's very quick happening . you are always left wanting much more than what has been advertised , and if you do n't like your action thrillers being slow and dialogue based , then you are buggered .		2		0
ugly . slow . tacky . stupid . i have a truckload of negative adjectives that i feel like applying to alien : resurrection , and i think they all fit . i know some people do n't share my appreciation for alien 3 , but good grief , i think it 's miles better than this installment . indeed , alien : resurrection strikes me as one of those train-wreck movies that leaves the average viewer scratching her head , wondering why a studio would ever give the green light to such a misguided project . alien 3 , unpopular though it was , brought the alien saga to a very definite close by killing off the protagonist , sigourney weaver 's ripley . in this film , ripley is brought back to life as a clone . indeed , this whole movie focuses on the cloning issue to the exclusion of all else ; it 's clearly trying to say something about genetic manipulation , or parenthood , or whatever , but the message -lrb- if any -rrb- is lost in a quagmire of grossness and bad writing . speaking of bad writing , the movie 's scriptwriter was none other than joss whedon , he of `` buffy '' fame . i gather that whedon has sort of disowned alien : resurrection because he does n't like the way his script was realized , but i 'd argue that the script was fundamentally unsound to begin with . it 's loaded with techno-babble , profanity and pilfered ideas , and populated by a cast of seedy , cardboard and thoroughly unlikable characters . apart from ripley , the only character who gets any development is winona ryder 's , but ryder 's acting stinks and her motivations are n't that interesting anyway . really , this film is the worst possible blend of elements from previous alien movies . unlike the first alien and alien 3 , it lacks the presence of a single , unstoppable , awesome alien creature - and unlike aliens , it lacks the excitement of a whole hoard of alien creatures . in alien : resurrection , there are 12 * somewhat * aliens - ho , hum . so we have n't got the sheer terror value of the first film here , or the raw energy of the second . we 've got 12 aliens milling around yet another boring spaceship setting . what an ill-conceived idea . there 's only one really good scene in this film - the underwater action segment , which is more sophisticated than any of the battles in the other alien films . but since i do n't care about the characters , i do n't care about who dies in that scene . and , apart from that one exciting bit , the film has few merits , choosing to get mired again and again in disgusting concepts and disgusting imagery of mutants , clones , and a half-alien half-human creature with saggy boobs . gross . if the tagline for the second film was `` this time , it 's war , '' the tagline for this one should have been , `` this time , bring a barf bag . '' or , better yet , `` this time ... stay home . '' atrocious stuff .		2		0
stallone was funny in `` oscar '' . he was positively hilarious in `` paradise alley '' . in `` stop ! or my mom will shoot '' , i think he was stuck in a no-win situation . all the negotiable laughs go to estelle getty as his mom , jobeth williams as his and roger rees gets a chuckle playing a much blander villain than he did in `` robin hood : men in tights '' . all sly can do is stand around like a deer caught in the headlights , maybe wondering if he should do another `` rocky '' or rambo '' . sure beats seeing him wander around in a diaper -lrb- relax ; it 's in a dream sequence - he 's not that old -rrb- . two stars . book 'em , dano - bad career move in the first degree .		2		0
some of the sets used in this movie were great . i presume they were historically accurate ? in any event , some of the scenes thus evoked were exotic and very appealing to the eye . the acting , the script , in fact , the rest of the movie , however , were appalling . ` alexander ' was more like a panto version of ` braveheart ' or ` henry v ' than anything real . there were awkward snippets of action , especially anything involving alexander and his troops , that appear to have been stolen from ` braveheart ' , shakespeare 's ` henry v ' , and even ` gone with the wind ' . one guesses that oliver stone might have imagined a much grander , more noble , and truly stirring combination of these elements . as it turned out , unfortunately for us in the audience , nothing fit . his international cast also seemed to be speaking in a variety of accents -- no one accent was selected by the director for the characters to use . the majority of the cast was british , so english and scottish accents prevailed , but there were others . angelina jolie , for example , sometimes sounded spanish , sometimes russian , but mostly like dracula . that was very strange ! overall , a real disappointment . it deserves a 1 out of 10 , but given the nice sets , i gave it a 2 .		2		0
about 15 minutes could have been cut out of the film with no problem . and perhaps a script doctor could have shaped it into a story that had some momentum . here , there 's an action sequence , and then some really unnecessary and lengthy scenes . it was very hard to develop any sympathy for a wisecracking idiot . i left before the film ended -- maybe 20 minutes early . after dozing through most of the cement truck scene , there was an endless fight between our heroes , over some really trivial and childish point . it was not funny and it would not stop . there were about four or five funny lines in the film , but that 's certainly not a reason to watch it . awful . i saw it in 2-d , and i ca n't imagine that 3d would make this film any better . only more expensive .		2		0
cold creek manor starts off in new york city where high flying businesswoman leah tilson -lrb- sharon stone -rrb- & her low budget documentary film-making husband cooper -lrb- dennis quaid -rrb- decide to leave the big city behind & take their two young children jesse -lrb- ryan wilson -rrb- & kristen -lrb- kristen stewart -rrb- & buy a large house out in the sticks . they buy a old farm called cold creek manor for a cheap price in the county of bellingham & move in . at first things go well & the huge manor house seems perfect as they begin to convert it into their dream home , however local thug dale massie -lrb- stephen dorff -rrb- used to live there before the bank sold it to pay his debts & still considers it his house . dale begins to terrorise & threaten the tilson 's but is there more to his intimidation than simply being upset about losing his house ? this english , american & canadian co-production was co-produced & directed by mike figgis who also provided the musical score & to be blunt cold creek manor is an awful film & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . the script by richard jefferies takes itself extremely seriously & is full of holes , is packed full of clichés & is perhaps one of the most boring & uneventful big budget hollywood flicks i 've ever seen . seriously cold creek manor is really boring to watch , i almost fell asleep on several occasions & by the hour mark & was sitting there just muttering the words ` please finish ' to myself . there are some truly hilarious scenes here , the stand out one has to be the house with about six snakes in it & the entire tilson family act like they are trapped in a burning house rather than faced with the huge threat of about six docile snakes . lets get this into perspective , this is n't a mass of 1000 's of deadly snakes like seen in raiders of the lost ark -lrb- 1981 -rrb- there 's a few snakes who do n't even try to attack them & it 's one of those scenes which you have to see to believe . another hilarious scene is where cooper is standing in his driveway which is paved with gravel , let 's not forget this is a huge house with a huge driveway yet he finds a clump of mud which interests him enough to pick it up & it turns out that it 's dale 's daughter 's brace & teeth ! again the scene is played totally seriously & it 's hard not to laugh at it . the character 's are awful & dale is never even given a reason for killing his wife & children , their decision making is terrible , their motivations are rubbish , the twists are predictable , the ending is awful & does n't make a whole lot of sense the story is dull & generally speaking cold creek manor is a serious big budget turkey of the highest order . director figgis ca n't decide what sort of film he 's making , is this meant to be a horror flick or a thriller ? the way the film is shot it resembles a haunted house horror flick but it 's not scary & nothing supernatural happens in it & since the plot is so predictable & poorly plotted it fails as a thriller as well . cold creek manor is just a mess of a film which i do n't really know who it would appeal too , as i 've said it 's not a horror film at all despite what the trailer may indicate . having the sort of budget this did means cold creek manor certainly looks nice enough with great sets which if they had been utilised in a horror film might have been very effective , as it stands i do n't really understand why it 's shot in the way it is . with what was probably a big budget cold creek manor is well made with superb production values but the film still sucks . set in new york this was shot in ontario in canada . the acting is bad , bad , bad . this just proves my theory that total recall -lrb- 1990 -rrb- & basic instinct -lrb- 1992 -rrb- were complete flukes & sharon stone is an awful actress in everything else she 's been in . dennis quaid looks like he 's just here for the money while dorff was nominated as worst supporting actor at the 2004 razzie awards for this which says it all . cold creek manor is awful , i honestly ca n't think of a better more to the point way to describe it , i really ca n't . at almost two hours & a terrible plot i would recommend you give cold creek manor the cold shoulder .		2		0
adventureland was the name and extreme deception was its game . the movie was quite different from what the trailers depicted . the trailer gives one the feeling there is somewhat of a faster pace with a deliberate sense of juvenile humor . i went in thinking that 's what i would get . instead , angst and doubt were more apparent . therefore , the ride tossed us all 180 degrees and upside down nauseating us all . anyone going in for the laugh will quickly recognize the deception . at best , a few chuckles will be all you get - if you can avoid tossing your cookies long enough . i felt like someone in an extremely long line , waiting to get into the park so i could get onto the roller coaster i could hear making the sounds that made me nearly drool from anticipation . but when i get in , i see the trash littering the grounds and rides made of cheap plastic and tin . even though the main ride gives me a couple minutes of enjoyment , it was not what i wanted and after 20 - 30 minutes i already wanted to go home . i am so tired of movies that get made only because it can be done . the production was so bad that it seemed the production team could very easily have been the characters themselves . this movie was not nearly as thought provoking as the creators may have thought . they should ` fess up and tell us they messed up . if they wanted us to appreciate the moment at the end , they should have tried connecting the beginning and middle with the same attention as they paid at the end . while the teens are growing up and the adults are acting like fools , no one even comes close to connecting with the audience except for kristen stewart 's sad and self-deprecating em . i have to say that i was totally offset by a scene where sensitivity towards political correctness was tarnished by irreverence to a `` retarded '' -lrb- their phrase -rrb- gate attendant . it was extremely hypocritical . in this scene , em chastises someone for being `` anti-gay and a bigot '' while another character -lrb- i forget who -rrb- makes a poorly placed `` joke '' about the gate attendant . funny how this thoughtlessness was shown by the creative team who made a movie about people who lacked thoughtfulness . save your money , miss the movie . rating this travesty a 2/10		2		0
fairuza balk 's performance in this movie was wonderful . the movie , as far as horror movies go , was quite enjoyable and entertaining while maintaining a level of tension which was not relieved by the few spots of well-placed humor . as a movie called , `` the craft ; '' however , this movie was a low blow to all pagans , be they wiccan , eclectic or users . i use the word puerile often when addressing movies i find childish and immature , and it certainly applies here . it portrays magick users with three basic stereo-types : 1 . evil 2 . pathetic sheep to be led 3 . classic . in truth , most magick users would have never followed anyone like nancy downs -lrb- balk -rrb- . her character was obviously unstable in the beginning , and insane towards the end . she was the epitome of the stereo-type of the tragic american `` goth . '' as such , she played her role well . this `` work '' struck a hard blow against the pagans . not in my top 1,000,000 favorite movies . for entertainment value alone , i 'll give it a grudging 1.8 / 10 from ... the fiend : .		2		0
the sequel that no one was asking for to `` tron '' -lrb- 1982 -rrb- . kevin flynn -lrb- jeff bridges from the first movie -rrb- disappears in 1985 without a trace . many year later his son sam flynn -lrb- garrett hedlund -rrb- discovers a virtual world where his father is with an evil twin named clu -lrb- a virtual young jeff bridges -rrb- . sam tries to get kevin and his hot brunette pal quorra -lrb- olivia wilde -rrb- to escape ... but clu will do anything to stop that . i saw the original `` tron '' back in 1982 in a theatre . despite the -lrb- then -rrb- state of the art special effects i was bored silly and could n't wait for the film to end ! the film was a which disney quickly ignored . now -lrb- 28 years later -rrb- we get a sequel -- and you know what ? it 's as bad as the original ! for starters this is too long running over 2 hours ! the music score is terrible -- the same music again and again and again ! gets monotonous quick . the special effects did n't impress me -- and the same ones are used all through the film . the plot made little sense -- but it could be because i dozed off twice because i was so bored ! it also had the same problem as the first -- during the `` game '' sequences you could n't tell who lived and who died . they all wore stupid helmets which made it impossible to tell them apart ! lastly the 3-d was n't needed . it 's a huge rip-off from hollywood charging you extra to see it in 3-d . my ticket was a ridiculous $ 15.50 ! the 3-d was barely used and it did n't help the special effects in the least . a few times i had to take off the 3-d glasses because it was making the image so dark i could n't make it out ! on the plus side the acting was good . hedlund -lrb- despite the lousy lines he was given -rrb- was young , handsome and appealing . wilde was incredibly sexy and gave a good performance . bridges was good in both his roles and it was fun seeing a young bridges . but , all in all , i was bored and annoyed at this . if you liked the original `` tron '' you might like this . i give it a 2 -- mostly for the acting .		2		0
in one of the many movies that mike , servo and crow have to watch on `` mystery science theater 3000 '' , a bunch of weird little monsters get loose and start wreaking havoc -lrb- which of course is the same thing as `` gremlins '' and `` ghoulies '' -rrb- . the only reason that i stopped short of giving `` hobgoblins '' 1/10 is that is has some sexy scenes . of course , that 's probably only because the director needed filler . let 's face it : when the same table gets tripped multiple times , you need a lot of filler . so , the movie on its own is 2/10 , but the `` mst3k '' version is 10/10 . pearl sure was cruel to make those guys watch this .		2		0
the nice people of japan make these cartoon movies where aliens and monsters have sex with -lrb- or should i say rape -rrb- innocent young school girls . this movie , for all its budget is basically one of those movies . the alien from the first movie is back but now there is another alien brought back from mars who has taken over an astronauts body . like any young good looking pair on a saturday night , they are looking to get laid . only problem is that this will result in a race of aliens that take over the would . a good reason to practice safe sex . but of course americans are a little bit scared of sex in their movies -lrb- the good guys always do it missionary style and the bad guys have the fun kinky sex -rrb- . the result is a dry sterile movie which does n't know how to explore the dark side of the topic material -lrb- humans and aliens having sex -rrb- . it would have been better to hide the sex and leave it to the viewers crazy imagination . it would be scarier or sexier -lrb- depending the imagination -rrb- .		2		0
this film is not recommended . back in my younger days , when i was 9 or 10 years old , i would always watch and enjoy the rocky and bullwinkle show . i think back , with fond memories of my favorite part of that show , a segment called fractured fairy tales . narrated by edward everett horton , these cartoons were various modernized send-ups of familiar children stories with a wicked comic bent and clever irony to them . i bring up this experience because mirror , mirror , a film meant to captivate children and adults alike , tries to capture that same humor and inventiveness , but fails miserably . the film is still fractured , but it is also dull , contrived , and extremely unfunny . where 's edward everett horton when you need him ? mirror , mirror takes the snow white folktale and skews it , rather then going to extremes which a fairy tale can and should do . the film has enough style with its bright production design and sets by tom and its lavish costumes by the late eiko ishioka . those are its few pluses , the minuses , however , are too numerous to name , but i 'll start anyway with most of the blame going to its director . the film 's director got his start directing music videos , under the name tarsem . he then graduated to feature films where his trademark use of lavish costumes , colorful sets , and an over-dependence of cgi under the name tarsem singh singled him out . now , taking his full , tarsem singh , he has outdone himself yet again by making one of the worst films of this movie season . -lrb- and i thought immortals was bad ! -rrb- perhaps , by changing his name slightly , he hopes to have a fresh start in the minds of discriminating moviegoers . not a chance ! his films have gotten progressively worse . the man certainly has a wonderful visual sense ; it 's just that he has no common sense when it comes to selecting woeful scripts . now let 's look at the script : writing credits include the brothers grimm -lrb- which i 'm sure they would have requested their names removed from this project -rrb- , jason keller , and melissa . the writers follow the conventional formula with some updating of the well-known material and they try to add some humor , mostly sophomoric , and wry remarks that are so tired and forced . their dialog weighs down the action and rarely advances the plot . characters are one-note and lines fall flat , and speaking of flatlining , let 's discuss the acting . julia roberts plays the evil stepmother and ambitious queen without much finesse and charm . she never achieves any real menace as the villainess . her distinct phrasing and speech pattern vacillates and her comic timing is off too . she underplays the character when it should have been more outrageously acted . -lrb- this just may be her worst performance ever , although i did miss charlie thorne . -rrb- lily collins , looking like a second-rate leslie caron , has no real charisma as our spunky heroine , snow , although frida kahlo would be envious of her beauty . the talented nathan lane , as brighton the queen 's servant , is totally wasted as he minces around the palace , delivering his lines like an young effeminate bob hope . the dwarfs , renamed napoleon , half pint -lrb- get the humor ? -rrb- , grub , wolf , butcher , grimm , and chuckles , are innocuous at best , and not the least bit memorable . only armie hammer as the prince brings a light comic flair to his role as the studly suitor . there is no happily-ever-after feeling when the movie finally ends , although the filmmakers try -lrb- and almost succeed in the closing credits -rrb- with a bollywood wedding number that , at least , has some energy . mirror , mirror is awful , awful . grade : d + note : visit my movie blog for more reviews : www.dearmoviegoer.com		2		0
` eighty-four ' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted . it is a very dark film , and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself . it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred . the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours -lrb- contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams -rrb- and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places . however , despite the film 's cleverness at portraying this idea , the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across . it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story .		2		0
i love the concept of time travel , and i try to see every movie created on the subject , however time machine falls short , way short . for one thing the movie is only 90 minutes long and is supposed to cover 800,000 years of history . three places are visited , and the majority of the movie is spent in a place that looks like the past that is 800,000 years in the future . the movie really has nothing to do with time travel . the book can not be that bad , and i hope that if i get a chance to read it , it will be a lot better . i want to rent the original and compare it ! horrible movie ! 2/10 i give it a two because guy pearce is an awesome actor and because memento is one of my favorite movies . it had two much of guy pearce in a serious role , when he is a comedic actor . hell mark boone junior is a major character , and only has a 10 minute role . just two many things happen that either not explained or do n't make any sense for the movie . the one scene that comes to mind is where mark boone junior 's character is going to let guy pearce leave in the time machine , and for no reason he attacks him . the one thing that guy pearce forgets is the only way to change the past is in the past , not the future .		2		0
sick , pointless film about people who get sexually turned on by car crashes . they stage elaborate reenactments of famous car crashes and they purposefully have car crashes to satisfy themselves . i do admire director david cronenberg for taking on risky material , but why he chose this is beyond me . the movie has little plot -lrb- and what it does moves slowly -rrb- and has some good actors giving their worst performances . james spader , holly hunter , rosanna arquette are stone-faced throughout the entire movie . also there 's a disgusting sequence involving arquette and her scars which almost made me turn this off . i do give the actors credit for doing some pretty raw sexually explicit sequences which earned this film an nc-17 . the one between spader and elias koteas was really surprising . if there 's a point to this it totally escapes me . i give it a 2 for cronenberg 's good direction and the sex -lrb- it 's not erotic at all but very interesting -rrb- . if you must see it get the nc-17 version -- the r rated one is cut to ribbons .		2		0
i brought this film home thinking it actually might be scary . no way , it basically a film about two living together people and their rolling around the house saying banal and very dumb things . i suspect this format was to scare crap less people of high and not very much sophistication . bingo , you have the teenage weenies just sitting on the edge of their seats holding the significant other of the moment and screaming . it really trash and not worth even a rental . however if you 've nothing really to do or plan other activity including deep sleep , during this flick , it could be for you after all . it did not scare me or my cat .		2		0
remember david cronenberg 's naked lunch ? i should have known what i 'd be in for after viewing this mess of a film . i must hand it to viggo mortensen , a fine actor , who comes up with a marvelous russian accent . otherwise , the story line is boring . a prostitute dies while emergency surgery is performed to deliver her baby . turns out that the baby 's father and family are russian mafia living in england . by the way , what are these characters doing in england ? this is never adequately explained . while the end is satisfying , the film is gruesome and highly predictable .		2		0
alright , i confess ... i do like the toilet-humor of , let 's say , american pie -lrb- that 's part 1 -rrb- or road trip , and i love jackass , for instance ... but unfortunately , old school did n't provide what all previous did : some laughs ... the ` story ' of 3 guys setting up a fraternity was n't only ridiculous and stupid -lrb- which i can overcome -rrb- , it was totally not funny and boring as well ... right down with freddy got fingered , this one ... 2/10 .		2		0
hell no ... the remake of hills have eyes was great . the cinematography was perfect , the movie worked with little effort of trying cheap thrills and the violence was raw and left me disturbed . i loved it as much as i loved aja 's high tension . now lets make a sequel right before the hype dies ... but why take a director like for such a polished movie ? rohtenburg might have been enjoyable for gorehounds and , but whats the idea giving him direction for this cash-in ? all my bad expectations became true ... the plot is ridiculously cheap . take the setting of the first movie , have an army squad come there and be murderer one by one by the mutants acting extremely stupid . the kills are rather boring -lrb- one suicide reminding me a lot of texas chainsaw massacre plus several pretty idiotic ones and a slashed off arm -rrb- ... its obvious they were trying to top part one with the crappy opening mutant birth scene -lrb- stupid implementation of the rape subject by the way -rrb- , the guy in the cesspool or the final mutant being heavily kicked in the ass to even out the boring first kills of the movie . yeah and you get another rape scene ... basically it looks like the movie wants to make this the main subject with raping mutants -lrb- , give ma a baby ! -rrb- but its in no way as shocking as raw visualisation . so whats left ... the mutant creature fx is pretty bad , you get plenty of stacked together scenes which could work in a clip show but just do n't make a logical plot -lrb- friendly mutant like the girl in part one dropped off somewhere , ridiculous explosion with dynamite collected by the mutants and an idiotic army guy setting it off , the real pretentious rape subject , the machine gun in the final mutants mouth , a mutant kitchen with loads of bodyparts -lrb- btw ... where do they get so much fresh meat in the midst of the desert ??? -rrb- , the revisiting of the nuclear test site with mutants hiding in uniforms for ghost train thrills -lrb- this one was particularly funny to me considering how extremely sophisticated the mutants work ! -rrb- , tough army guys swearing and shooting with no clue , army chicks showing their boobs and to top off the sophistication of the mutants they even learn using army high tech equipment in the closing scene -lrb- of course this one sais `` part iii coming soon ! -rrb- -rrb- . its all a cheap mix with an implausible plot and implausible reactions of the actors . of course what kills the movie is that its not shocking as it wants to be and the gorehounds wo n't dig in the boring kills that make the first 2/3rds of the movie and the real average creature fx . if you missed aja 's take on the subject , go and watch this one ... its worth it . part 2 of the hills is worth to be forgotten immediately .		2		0
attack of the clones is a film which relies to much on special effects and not enough on dialogue and overall . the characters are in no way as likeable as chewbacca , han solo and the original charaters . while the original star wars trilogy used modelling and puppet techniques , attack of the clones relies to much on computer effects . far too much blue screen work . do n't get me wrong , the blue screen is good in small doses . in small doses . but 90 % of what we see on the screen are computer effects . the film 's battle scenes are well choreographed and prepared , but endlessly boring . the dialogue is wooden and duller than you could possibly imagine . `` yes master , no master '' . and as for the love story , never has a relationship seemed so unconvincing . the story is thrown together with little thought being put into it . all the cgi in the world can not save it from it 's lamentable script . it 's minorly better than episode 1 , but still not much to write home about . this one 's for star wars fans and people with good attention spans only .		2		0
`` xxx2 : the next level '' -lrb- revolution studios and columbia pictures changed the subtitle from `` state of the union '' for international territories , for obvious reasons -rrb- comes from the director of `` die another day , '' which was terrible ; producer neal h. moritz , whose last credited project was the dire -lrb- and thankfully -rrb- `` point pleasant '' ; is a sequel to the dreadful `` xxx '' ; and comes equipped with samuel l. jackson 's stated dislike of making movies with rappers . on this showing , you ca n't blame him . trading in vin diesel -lrb- his character is written out by someone saying that he got killed in bora bora -rrb- for ice cube is no improvement ; not only is he not the most expressive actor , but he 's not that convincing in action -lrb- when he 's being chased by scott speedman you just know that speedman would catch him like that -lrb- snaps fingers -rrb- in real life -rrb- . in fairness to mr. cube , he 's far from the only thing wrong with this ; simon kinberg 's screenplay seems not only to have been aimed at emotionally and intellectually stunted 13-year-olds but written by them as well , with the plot starting idiotically and continuing from there - the villainous secretary of defence played by willem dafoe is so pantomime villainous that when he makes a speech to jackson you 're surprised he does n't laugh maniacally . suspending disbelief is one thing , but when you have a movie that expects people to believe that tanks can be handled like motorbikes ... and which works in such daft plot turns as characters having their deaths faked just so they can be around for the climax -lrb- why not just kill them there ? -rrb- ... and that has a finale which depends on a car and a presidential bullet train being able to fit on the same track despite the car being a compact if speedy sports car ... in this case it 's just impossible . admittedly it does n't help that said scenes are incompetently executed thanks to shockingly bad special effects and shoddy direction ; some of the miniatures are glaringly obvious , and i particularly hope that lead effects house industrial light and magic did n't do the cgi bullet train shots . and as for the way some of the shots go from film to what looks like video and back again ... the cast is n't much good either , although it 's fun to see peter strauss as the president -lrb- in spite or because of his not sounding like he believes a word of this -rrb- ; xzibit not only helps parts of this seem like `` pimp my ride : the movie '' but he ca n't act , dafoe is special guest villain level , and jackson phones it in . as for the female characters , nona gaye and sunny mabrey are pretty much defined by their cleavage and by the fact that one 's good and the other -lrb- the one who looks like a cross between nicolette sheridan and rachel bilson -rrb- is n't . -lrb- the movie ca n't even be laddish properly ; for some reason the sexiest woman in the movie -lrb- max , who plays xzibit 's girlfriend and who helps out with the robbery of the cheese truck -rrb- is n't listed in the credits . -rrb- and the tiresome , rap numbers do n't help , certainly not compared to marco beltrami 's score . -lrb- ironically , at one point on hearing the female string quartet bond our hero complains about the music ; they are not to blame for the aural wrongs . -rrb- `` xxx2 : whatever '' is so unexciting and so absurd that despite its stabs at relevance -lrb- our hero claims dafoe is hatching `` world war iv '' -rrb- , the only way to get through it is as a laugher ; the sight of ice cube in a suit and tie -lrb- with umbrella ! -rrb- is funnier than his intentional attempt at comedy later in the same scene . to make it worse , the last scene leaves the door wide open for a third movie ... if it does happen , why not cast scarlett johansson or charlotte church as the new triple x ? it 's not like realism is a key factor here .		2		0
near the end of this movie one character is explaining about releasing a story to the press so convoluted that it obscures the facts and that neatly summaries my view about this nonsense of a film . cop seeks to uncover why his daughter was murdered and finds all sorts of conspiracies and subplots . for most of this film the actors talk in riddles and i ai n't got a clue what any of it is about if indeed the actors do ! there is one english performer who is totally out of place with his cockney fruit and veggie seller accent and acting ; none of the players in this picture are convincing in their roles . the plot is totally ludicrous and the actors give the impression they know that and give half hearted effort to their work . the only reason i give this movie just above the lowest vote is for some reasonable special effects action : this film is trash and i wonder how i managed to get to the end of it , 2/10		2		0
alexandre aja 's `` mirrors '' is a sad reflection -lrb- did i actually say that ? -rrb- of where american horror movies are at -- at least the ones getting wide releases . of course , much better stuff like `` inside '' gets dumped straight to dvd because a -rrb- it 's not `` american '' , b -rrb- the french characters do n't speak `` american '' , and c -rrb- it 's too `` extreme '' for horror fans -lrb- ! -rrb- . this film from the overrated director of `` the hills of eyes '' is just depressing . keifer sutherland , who ca n't do anything with a terribly obvious script , starts work as the night watchman of an abandoned department store in new york . he starts seeing weird images in the surviving mirrors in the old store and is soon telling everybody around him that the mirrors are out to get him . what the hell made alexandre aja think that this would make a scary movie , let alone a good movie ? it 's the worst idea in recent history . it does for mirrors what `` dead silence '' did for puppets . there is a ridiculous backstory that tries to explain what 's going on in the mirrors , but you wo n't give a flaming f *** as you try valiantly to exorcise the insidious boredom from your brain . the film has half a dozen climaxes and gore that belongs to another movie . it 's a misfire in every department . aja 's sense of judgement stinks , so i 'm not looking one bit forward to his `` piranha '' remake . the genre is scraping the bottom of the leaking barrel .		2		0
altman should go into retirement , as should scorsese , and all the other former great directors who waste everyone 's time with their new material . this overlong , unfunny starts off with a half-hour of pure tedium , in a sort of `` driving miss daisy '' vein ; with an old woman and her loyal black friend . absolutely nothing happens in this part of the movie . i wish it had stayed that way , because once things start happening that is when the movie gets really annoying . -lrb- like sting 's famous : `` life was easy when it was boring '' , or `` this film was easier when it was boring '' . -rrb- the overly familiar plot -- already milked dry by the hitchcock - of an innocent man accused of murder is just too stupid . it also sinks any chance that the gags and the humour might have ; but the jokes are mostly mediocre so it does n't matter . the other major problem with the movie is the rather `` blah '' cast : julianne moore , glenn close , o'donnell , that `` country '' singer , and worst of all - liv tyler . while moore is convincing as a semi-retarded woman , close is simply annoying in yet another role . o'donnell is typically bland , while tyler is not only awfully miscast but a bad actress , as well . for altman to cast her as some white-trash southern girl is an insane move . charles dutton has a very cliché role : he is , pure goodness and is intellectually superior to just about everyone - without feeling that way . and what an annoying plot-point in the kid 's father not wanting to listen to what the kid had witnessed . plus , there is that annoying sporadic that any movie can do without . what a waste of time .		2		0
i knew this would n't be as good as the brilliant original film , i guess i just wanted to know how good or bad it was compared to it . you remember how at the end of the last one , you thought damien was dead and he suddenly reappeared , well he 's grown up now , aged 13 -lrb- jonathan scott-taylor -rrb- and discovering what he really is . living with his uncle richard thorn -lrb- the bridge on the river kwai 's william holden -rrb- and aunt ann thorn -lrb- lee grant -rrb- , damien is anxious to inherit everything his relatives have to enable him to rise to power . oh , and in the meantime he is doing something with the military . along the way there are some more character deaths , but they are n't up to the terrifying or bizarre standard as the previous film . also starring robert foxworth as paul , nicholas pryor as charles warren , lew ayres as bill atherton , beetle juice 's sylvia sidney as aunt marion , aliens ' lance henriksen as sergeant neff , elizabeth shepherd as joan hart , lucas donat as mark thorn , allan arbus as , fritz ford as murray , meshach taylor as dr. kane , john j. newcombe as teddy , john charles burns as butler , paul cook as colonel , diane daniels as jane and robert e. ingham as teacher . this is a very forgettable sequel , not even the very occasional and satanic deaths can rescue it from being a waste of time . pretty poor !		2		0
as i sat watching hot rod , i was constantly reminded of napoleon dynamite . each have sort of a feel , and they both revolve around similar characters and feature very similar humor . the primary differences between the two films is that hot rod has more well-known actors , a bigger budget , and very , very few successful gags . napoleon dynamite was no masterpiece , but it at least provided a sufficient amount of chuckles to satisfy audiences willing to accept it for what it is . in the case of a film like hot rod , even those willing to be entertained by hot rod on its own terms will find very little to laugh , or even smile at . rod kimble wishes to be a stuntman like his late father , and is constantly doing stupid stunts . rod is sadly inept , so many stunts end with him getting hurt . rod wishes to prove to his stepfather that he is a man , though , and the only way rod can do this , is to beat his stepfather up . so , when rod 's stepfather has a heart condition that requires a heart transplant for him to live , rod must raise the money for this , so that his stepfather can live long enough to see rod prove himself to be a man . the humor is simply dumb . the many gags in this movie can only be described as idiotic , aiming for those with high toleration for such idiocy , or for those with low maturity . it goes without saying , though i 'll say it anyway : hot rod is not for those looking for a sophisticated comedy . there are various points in this film where events occur for seemingly no reason other than to create hilarity . a random street brawl suddenly occurs during one scene , and the chaos only served to give me a head ache as opposed to the laughter that hot rod was trying to achieve . there are many other examples of this throughout the film , too numerous to name . it just feels like the writers were too lazy to write a series of cohesive events , so basically anything goes in this movie . many gags are painfully unfunny . some are quite predictable . one supposedly humorous scene involves rod beating up his 60 year-old stepfather , but this is more painful and sad to watch than funny . i already knew i probably would n't like this film before it even started . but seeing as hot rod is n't even a full 90 minutes , i figured any pain would be brief . unfortunately for me , the film just seems to go on forever . unfunny comedies often feel long , but this felt like an eternity . the cast does try pretty hard , but the material is so unfunny , it 's hard to blame the performances for being as weak as they are . andy samberg plays the imbecilic rod kimble perfectly . it 's a shame he does n't do anything particularly funny . the other cast members are n't even worth mentioning . the score , composed by trevor rabin , consists of terribly dated sounding synthesizer tunes that sound like a nightmare from the 80 's . it 's simply terrible , and the soundtrack consists of an assortment of dated rock songs . between the `` music '' and the awful screenplay , i wonder if i would have enjoyed hot rod more if the film was set on mute . hot rod is stupid . there really is no other way to describe it . even hot rod 's biggest defenders would have a difficult time denying that . the few gags that are worth smiling or laughing at actually make you feel guilty for doing so , simply because the humor is so absurdly dumb . even those in the mood for a mindless comedy will certainly be disappointed by this obvious cash-in on the napoleon dynamite trend .		2		0
interesting enough horror/thriller , with argento 's usual disregard for logic . not as mind-numbingly dumb as his `` trauma '' or `` bird with absurd illogic '' -lrb- sorry , i meant `` bird with crystal plummage '' -rrb- , but the film has its share of absurdity . first of all , the film 's 4th corpse is totally accidentally lead into the -lrb- first -rrb- murderer 's house by a dog who just happened to have attacked her - of all people , and chased her to the said house . it 's already silly enough that a woman would just happen to be chased by a dog into a serial killer 's home , but to have that woman know the writer whom the killer is imitating - that is just too ridiculous . towards the end , i was starting to suspect that the writer is the -lrb- second -rrb- murderer , and i must say , while that is a -lrb- more-or-less -rrb- unique twist , it does n't do the movie 's logic any justice ; to have an initial murderer and then have another person use the situation and murder as well - well , that 's just too stupid . it 's also far too coincidental that the writer had killed in his youth , and that he would come into a connection with a serial killer later in his life . what are the odds of that ? but i would n't ask argento that question . his appreciation of statistics and odds is probably just as low as his appreciation of logic . a thing i noticed in argento 's movies : the soundtrack , though original and interesting , in many scenes does n't fit the action and sometimes does n't even fit the genre .		2		0
i heard the critics saying that this film was rubbish , and then a not very reliable friend told me that it was pretty good , so i decided to see which opinion i would agree with , and i 'm glad to say it was the critics . from the writer of juno , this film mixes themes from carrie , the possession of the exorcist and apparently something to do with the film heathers where girls enjoy murders . anyway , basically and near slutty cheerleader jennifer check -lrb- razzie nominated megan fox -rrb- and nerdy bookworm anita ` needy ' lesnicki -lrb- mamma mia 's amanda seyfried -rrb- are best friends , even though they have hardly anything in common . then all the sudden jennifer begins to lust and appetite for human flesh and blood , and not in the sexual sense , after being in a fire in a dodgy local bar . over the next few nights , many male classmates are found having parts of their bodies eaten , and needy is almost trying to ignore this to stay friends with jennifer . the reason for jennifer doing these horrible things is because she was sacrificed for a black magic ritual , but she was not a virgin , so she has become a flesh-eating succubus . in the end , needy , who has been relating most of the film , being in a mental prison , did indeed kill jennifer , which is obviously why she has been placed where she is . also starring johnny simmons as chip , the o.c. 's adam brody as nikolai and spider-man 's j.k. simmons as mr. . fox may be a gorgeous creature , obviously not with her blood-covered fangs , but she is really not that good , seyfried tries and fails to be the main star , and the gory effects just do n't make the film any better , it is just a waste of time . it did n't scare me , it did n't make me laugh , and it did n't make me feel like it was worth watching , a terrible comedy horror film . pretty poor !		2		0
surprisingly flat comedy about a fashion magazine editor and his eccentric psychiatrist , and their adventures with mini-skirted birds . peter o'toole is game but miscast ; peter sellers , in an exaggerated beatles wig , seems constricted by the mostly unfunny screenplay , his personality never coming to a full boil . glossy , , but unfunny picture , which does n't even capture the swinging '60s with much appeal . directed by clive donner with assistance from richard talmadge ; written by woody allen , who also makes his movie debut . the title song , sung by tom jones , may be the most memorable thing in it . * 1/2 from ****		2		0
jude law goes all camp and wants all the children in the world to stop believing in isla fisher , the easter kangaroo , and alec baldwin as the slightly aggressive santa with a non-specific but hilarious accent . jack frost comes to save the say by causing near fatal accidents on our usual safe conscious roads . hilarity should ensue . the first thing you realise about this film is the lack of love and care it has compared to other dreamworks projects of recent years . it feels rushed , the animation is n't up to much , and it 's main crime is that it 's boring . its been claimed by many that this is the avengers of local legends , which sounds enticing for sure , but when it comes to a head , the most interesting characters are sidelined in order for jack frost to be the hero . the character has been done a dozen times before , the cheeky young lad who does n't remember his past , causes lots of trouble and yet redeems himself at the end . yawn . jackman and baldwin are left to nothing more than support , and this is a shame , as they could have been something that livened up the film . law is easily the best thing in this movie , and in fact his pitch is a great animated villain of recent memory , like the hans gruber of the animated world . other than law , the film is a complete stinker , mechanical right down to the rusty cogs and soulless . dreamworks have really sold out with this . no fun .		2		0
killers from space starts as scientist dr. doug martin -lrb- peter graves -rrb- is monitoring the aftermath of an atomic bomb test detonation at soledad flats in nevada from a military jet , dr. martin sees a strange flashing light which when approached causes the jet to crash . doug 's wife ellen martin -lrb- barbara -rrb- is given the bad news , however rather unexpectedly doug reappears alive & well apart from a strange scar on his chest . mr. briggs -lrb- steve pendleton -rrb- of the fbi is on the case & after noticing doug act strangely suspects he may be leaking information to the other side , sure enough doug is caught with sensitive information regarding the tests . doug is given a truth serum for obvious reasons & is then questioned , what doug says is a tale of aliens from a distant planet called astron delta & their need to wipe out humanity using giant carnivorous lizards & insects so they can conquer earth for themselves ! nobody believes him but doug is determined to stop them ... produced & directed by w. lee wilder this is a poverty row 50 's sci-fi film which has nothing going for it . the script by bill raynor which seems to take itself very seriously starts out like a spy flick with briggs the fbi geezer chasing doug around who is passing on secrets to the other side but then about halfway through the ping-pong eye ball aliens are introduced & it suddenly transforms into some unintentionally hilarious camp classic . you know i 'm sitting there watching killers from space as the main english speaking killer from space dude is talking to doug & revealing their entire plan & practically telling doug how they can be defeated as well & i thought to myself would a seemingly intelligent alien tell someone this so he could pass it on & possibly stop them ? then again maybe i 'm just thinking about this film too much . the film also has a stab at a moral message about atomic bomb testing & radiation but in the end it 's very ineffective & has no conviction to it . at only 70 odd minutes in length it 's short but it does n't feel like it , in fact this is one dull , boring & even at 70 minutes overlong mess of a film . director wilder makes a complete mess of everything , the action scenes are as lifeless as they come & any serious message about atomic testing is lost in the crapness of it all . the aliens themselves are hilarious , the ping pong eye balls , the with thick belts & lets not forget the large bushy eyebrows . these guys are meant to be scary but they are more like to bring about fits of laughter rather than send chills down your spine . there are also a collection of giant lizards & insects here , they are just normal lizards and insects filmed in close-up though & again are quite funny to watch . the rest of the special effects like the plane crashing are also terrible . the film has dated badly & there 's another funny 50 's bit when we go inside doug & ellen 's bedroom , despite being married they sleep in different beds separated by a bedside cabinet ! technically the film is poor with bad editing , awful day-for-night shooting which does n't match , terrible use of stock footage , not so special effects & rock bottom production values . the acting is suitably rubbish & a fair amount of the cast actually smoke on screen . killers from space is a bit pants really , there 's no scares or decent sci-fi in it , the aliens are ridiculous & despite being a public domain film so you can download it for free it 's just not worth the time or effort .		2		0
there was a bit of a buzz around the first human centipede movie . people could n't quite believe that a film about three people sewn together , mouth to anus , would ever get made , let alone be any good . it turned out it was n't that great anyway but it certainly had some novelty value . human centipede ii - full sequence , is a whole new kettle of fish . this is the story of a mentally ill security guard who is so obsessed with the first human centipede movie that he decides to make his own centipede . this time with twelve people and with no medical background whatsoever . you will agree , it 's a clever premise , but that 's the only good thing you can say about this film . shot in black and white ' this film is so revolting that you feel that you need to jump in the shower after watching it . the main actor -lrb- who does not talk -rrb- is a disgusting looking fat man and his vulgarity just adds to the unpleasantness of the film . it is extremely violent , it has some really nasty scenes in it . one where he knocks a man 's teeth , slowly with a hammer , really springs to mind . it has no redeemable features and you have to wonder what was going through the actors minds when they was shooting this movie . human centipede is a completely unnecessary film that tries to shock for shocks sake and should be avoided at all costs .		2		0
i like michael mann , and i like gangster movies ; but the trailers on this were not inviting - flashy , slick , without a lot of tension . so i waited 'till the film got to the bargain theater . my apprehension proved to be spot on . while there are a number of really fine set-pieces here , i have n't seen a film so utterly lacking in focus or theme in a long time . the bare story of the real john dillinger is strong enough to carry the viewer of the film , but did the audience not know at least something of that story , it would be hard to follow story here , it goes all over the place . and i am shocked that we get to know so few of the characters here - it takes a while to recognize one g-man from another , even after they have become important to the narrative -lrb- such as it is -rrb- . it 's hard to figure out why mann decided to go wild with the historical inaccuracy ; i 'll mention one i found most annoying , first because it is a seemingly small matter , but it also reflects two larger problems . i 'm referring to the repeated use of billie holiday on the soundtrack - she 's even on the radio whenever dillinger turns it on - unfortunately , she was n't known during the early thirties , she was just starting out ! it 's clear someone wants to make a point by playing her that often - but i have n't got the foggiest idea what it is ? is dillinger supposed to be a ` black white man ' like they say of bill clinton ? is his career a foreshadow of 's ? could n't they find any other period music to play ? which remarks the soundtrack itself , which is one of the worst in a major motion picture in recent years - it 's a mess , evoking a dozen different emotions , almost none having anything to do with the images we 're watching at the moment . the dialog is needlessly pretentious . one thing i feared was having to compare this film to john milius ' `` dillinger '' with warren oates - but the comparison ca n't be avoided . milius , taking his cue from `` bonnie and clyde , '' from the earlier lawrence tierney film `` dillinger , '' and from the gaudy gangster films of roger corman , fashioned a film that was both flashy yet homespun , part unabashed b-movie , part evocation of american gothic . milius ' film is by far the better of the two . even his occasional tinkering with historical accuracy could be forgiven , since it was clear he had a firm grasp on what the dillinger phenomenon was really all about - ` farm boy makes good by turning bad ' is an undeniable of american life . but mann clearly - and desperately - wants dillinger to be a real hero , not only of his time but ours . this is the most romanticized version of dillinger - of any american outlaw - i 've ever seen , making the many cinematic apologies for jesse james seem like harsh condemnations by comparison . but it ca n't be done . the brilliance of warren oates ' performance in the milius film is that oates plays dillinger like a runaway farm-boy with a sense of humor and a quick temper , who just happened to rob banks for a living . that 's as much as you can give any professional criminal without lying about the nature of crime namely , it 's about stealing other peoples ' money and hurting many of them in the process . the cowardly punk dillinger as performed by lawrence tierney is probably even closer to the truth . but the sum of all this is not simply that mann has romanticized dillinger ; that , in a b-movie at least , could have been forgiven . the real problem is that he sentimentalizes the bandit . this turns the whole shenanigans soft like mush , instead of the hard-boiled crime film we should have gotten . and this leads into one of the worst finales in film history , dragging on and on , and even after we know the story is done - it still goes on , trying to turn itself into a tear-jerker ! what a waste ! and what a disappointment from michael mann . and do n't blame the actors , as some critics have done - they 're actually trying to do a good job - but the script is poor , and mann ca n't think of any way to direct it properly .		2		0
i have to admit that i was n't expecting much from this film . the trailer made it seem so ridiculous and predictable . starring vin diesel -lrb- saving private ryan , pitch black -rrb- , plays an extreme sports fanatic who is sent by our government to find out about a russian secret society called , anarchy ' 99 . naturally , this secret society , or gang , has plans of world domination by the use of chemical weapons . it 's a pretty obvious plot that we have seen used before . some may say that i should lighten up about the whole thing , and remember that this kind of film is more for fun , what with it 's action sequences , slick one-liners , fast cars , cool fight scenes , and beautiful women . well , its action sequences were n't done all that well , in my opinion . its slick one-liners were n't even amusing . i could care less about its fast cars , or it 's typical fight sequences . it does have a beautiful woman , but most of them seem like skanks . there was one thing that i did think was somewhat cool ; an avalanche scene , that although was impossible , was cool visually . and vin diesel can act , although this was a film that really did n't require him to give a good performance . i would have expected something much better from director rob cohen , who last year directed the successful film , the fast & the furious , which was n't that bad at all . but xxx just stinks ! look , to sum it up , xxx tries to be a younger , cooler james bond . sorry folks , you do n't send a boy to do a man 's job . * 1/2		2		0
infuriating story from a stephen king book about elderly man with esp -lrb- anthony hopkins , in an easy , sly performance -rrb- befriending young bobby -lrb- anton yelchin -rrb- , the boy of a single mother who both live downstairs in the same building . william goldman 's mediocre screenplay pokes around , trying to come up with interesting details , but the whole thing is too belabored , with arty directorial flourishes adding nothing -lrb- such as the slow-motion photography with bobby and his friends playing in the river -rrb- . the focus of the piece is so off that a bullying kid is not only revealed to be a cross-dresser -lrb- huh ?? -rrb- , he gets away from criminal punishment with a good , stiff beating from vengeful bobby , while good-hearted hopkins gets hauled away -lrb- again , huh ?? -rrb- . the picture does n't even have the sense to tie its ends together at the , instead giving us a voice-over dripping with sentimentality . * 1/2 from ****		2		0
this has got to be the worst premise a movie has been given in a long time , i mean come on . the only thing i can say is i hope ryan reynolds has not damaged his career after appearing in this . and as for ruined careers , jeff bridges role is worse . it could have been much better . the script was and the direction was terrible . at points in the film , it is hard to remember which world you are seeing , the characters or the avatars that really represent them . an old chinese man as reynolds avatar and a beauty as bridges ' . if the film `` monkeybone '' comes to mind , that is what i am reminded of when i write this . `` r.i.p.d.

dr. seuss has sores all over his elbows from rolling over in his grave from this movie . this movie was totally disrespectful to dr. seuss and his entire family ! mike myers is too r rated to play the cat in this movie . the jokes were inappropriate for a children 's movie . the plot was very creative . they even made a plug for universal studios during a scene from this movie . there was very little in the movie that was actually based on the book . for those who saw the movie in the theater , you missed a lot of great scenes . they put 16 deleted scenes in this movie on the dvd . they help you understand the plot of this movie better . what was the point of putting alec baldwin 's character in this movie ?		2		0
normally , i start a comment with what the film was about . unfortunately , i can not do so for this film because i do not know what the film was about . there were many problems with this movie . the directing was terrible . there were many scenes that could have been shot much better . who wants to see an action scene with an aerial wide angle view ? to make matters worse , this view was often the only view that the fighting scenes were shot in . there were times when there were tens of guys trying to kill milla jovovich in all directions , but suddenly all these people died after milla waves her arm . and the corpses formed a neat circle . haha , were they trying to be the futuristic da vinci code ? this film tried too hard to look stylish . there were more than 3 occasions when the bad guys fell to the floor after being shot . they fell one by one as if the were line dancing . it was so choreographed that it became unbelievable and comical . as others have pointed out , weapons materialising in the hands all of a sudden was too unconvincing . the worst part of the movie was that scenes jump from one to the next without explanation . in one scene , milla & the kid were in a building , with bad guys all around them . there was no escape . the next second , milla & the kid was already outside the building , without any explanation how they got out of the building ! this was just one example . if i quoted all of these ridiculous example , i would be writing down the whole movie . seriously , avoid this film . it is very bad .		2		0
this is a horrible movie that actually made me laugh a bunch of times but that still does n't save it from my rating . the laughs have absolutely nothing to do with the plot and are mostly sight gags . the entire premise is absurd , instead of telling the truth to the new girl he met about wearing a wedding ring he concocts a lie so complicated and stupid it could never work under any circumstances . one point being the idea that he is automatically going to stay with this girl even though they only had one night together but still creates situations that would not work in any future with her . his fake wife is really his assistant , his cousin has to do a fake german accent and his fake daughter has to continue to do a english cockney accent forever ? the blonde girlfriend must be the dumbest woman on the planet to believe the nonsense she is being told . the end is predictable . the only good thing was nick swardson who is very funny .		2		0
the story of a sudden change in the weather that brings an over night ice age is one of the dullest films in the past few years . if it were n't for the spectacular visuals this movie would sink to the `` never to be remembered '' pile faster than the winds change in this story . worse is the fact that many of fx shots seem to have been cribbed from many other , better , films . emmerich is , at his heart , a b-movie director . if you look at the films he 's made they have all been glorified b-movies . what made them work was great characters that you could care about . the trouble here the characters are all one note and even the great leads ca n't work miracles with a script that simply calls for one emotion from most of them . you quickly learn not to care and you quickly lapse into boredom . i will not even get into the science which is so much a joke that anyone with a brain ca n't suspend disbelief . -lrb- give me the core any day -rrb- unless you really feel the need to pay 10 bucks to see this on the big screen -lrb- the visuals are at best a third of the running time -rrb- stay home and wait for video ... or cable .		2		0

notice i said it sucked to me . i am not going to bash people for liking this movie , but do n't bash me for hating it . this movie is a thinly disguised anti-war movie that mocks patriotism and such . this movie is set in the future and the society has become more of a nazi type government . forget trying to analyze it , the science is quite bad so forget it . you will just hurt your head , thinking how it is impossible to fly the distances portrayed in this movie . in this movie they want you to join the military , and apparently you have to be a supermodel to join . come on people , there are n't this many good-looking people at a college , most people are average looking , but you have to suspend your disbelief . the reason i hate this movie is that i ca n't stand the characters , they are all annoying and you almost crave for them to die , but then whom do you pull for ? the bugs ? they have no personality . so here and there lies the problem , the director purposely made this movie this way , you are supposed to hate the characters , i think i read where this was supposed to be what if the lead couple in the movie grease became nazis and fought a war in space . so right of the bat this is going to turn off a lot of people whether they get it or not . many who enjoyed the movie did n't get it , but just like the violence and action , but i was n't even overly impressed with the action . the movie is supposed to be satire , but it was n't funny enough or witty enough for me . it played like a satire that took itself to seriously for its own good . do n't however ; dismiss the movie based on my review . many like it so give it a look see and write a review here . many people like its antiwar messages and think it is a great play on things , others just like the action so as bad as i thought it was you may find something to like about it . i just hope i never live in a future where guys and gals can shower together and act like it is no big deal .		2		0
a group of young british men and woman on holiday in spain go yachting , but things get ugly after one of them turns up dead . this is an amateurish , low-budget thriller that veers from soft-core porn to repellent violence , but is mostly lame , particularly the premise that leads to the first death . it is poorly acted by a group of unknown actors , most making their film debuts . blackburn makes his feature film debut as director and co-writer but he 's in over his head . for non-british viewers , the soundtrack is also a problem if subtitles are not available , as the actors mumble their lines in heavy english accents .		2		0
arnold must have had some really big medical bills to pay off or something , because i ca n't see any other reason why he made this film . cliched , silly and downright boring , this is the type of film that could end a career . just look at where gabriel byrne and kevin pollack are right now ? heck , look at where arnold is ! end of days is correct , for a great many careers that is .		2		0
even not being a fan of the `` star trek '' movies or universe of shows and books and such , i still find some enjoyment in some of the movies featuring the old cast and in the case of `` first contact '' even the new cast a bit . this one though was kind of sad to watch ... it seemed to want to be so much , but it failed on so many levels to be one of the worst star trek movies . the plot is very far fetched seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate trek adventure , but it ends up an unfunny when it tries to be , not tense when it wants to be and not action packed like it tries to be mess of inconsistencies . the whole movie to take a phrase from spock is illogical . the effects are nothing special as i have seen episodes of next generation that are just as good , which is to say it is fine for a television show , but not a major motion picture . the plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop spock 's brother then joins him on his quest to find god , yes you read that correctly . the klingons make a tacked on appearance , which actually will set up the much better undiscovered country movie . all in all you know it is bad when the best part of the film is kirk , bones and spock singing row your boat , well spock was not really singing , but rather questioning the lyrics .		2		0
this movie was nothing like what i expected it to be . it looked to me like a movie where the kids get the run of the house and go crazy , throwing parties and doing outrageous , irresponsible things . it ended up being closer to working girl : the oldest teen has to get a job and falls backwards into an upwardly mobile fashion career . the responsibilities of maintaining the house eventually turn each of the children into productive citizens . what bothered me was n't so much the story as the fact that almost nothing was funny . it ended up being closer to a drama . there performances were cartoonish , but at the same time , were n't into so-bad-they 're - funny territory -lrb- except for the guy who played gus . someone should have seen this movie and realized the potential this actor had as a physical comedian -rrb- . so there was almost nothing to like . once in a while , we get a good line or two , like when the brother and sister were arguing like a married couple . but as soon as one of these good exchanges got going , the movie cuts right away to something else , killing the comedy momentum . my opinion was that it was an idea with good potential that was completely mishandled .		2		0
very disappointing , i had thought i would be seeing a return to good comedy for murphy , and a continuing of the comic talents shown by deniro in some of his previous films . however , neither was present . deniro is playing a normal tough cop , while murphy plays an over the top , run of the mill cop . paired up by a tv company for a new reality show , they slowly begin to work together and each moves toward the other , murphy becoming a good cop and partner , while deniro becoming more open and relaxed about his job . in the meantime , we get bored , and i 'm unsure why . the film seemed good enough , the set pieces and stunts were nice , yet i could n't help but feel we 've seen all this before . quite a few times in fact , and in one series , lethal weapon , and they did it spot on . however , this does n't . i found myself uninterested in anything that was going on and very detached from the entire movie .		2		0
i remember hearing about this movie , all of the hype about it , `` it 's really scary '' , `` people are throwing up because its so scary '' , etc , etc. . well they must have been seeing a different movie , because the one i saw was n't scary in the slightest , and most importantly , i did n't really feel much for the main characters . it was completely illogical for them to continue to remain where they were . i liked the premise and idea of the film , i can see where the director was coming from , but ultimately , its one of those films that might sit in peoples dvd collections , but is unlikely to ever be watched . a dvd unwatched is pointless , much like this movie .		2		0
this is a movie about vampires . i get that . it 's not supposed to be taken seriously or even be believable . i get that , too . and usually i really , really like vampire movies . if they 're well done they 're frightening , suspenseful and mysterious ; sometimes vaguely erotic and sometimes quite humorous . you can have a lot of fun with vampire movies . i get that . but i did not have a lot of fun with `` priest . '' the thing that - to me - makes vampire movies fun and scary is that even though they 're about something as unbelievable as vampires , they 're nevertheless sort of believable movies . they place the viewer into some sort of circumstance or situation or setting to which we can relate . it 's that creepy sort of `` the vampire could be living right next door to you and you 'd never know it '' sort of atmosphere that really makes the genre work . `` priest '' had none of that . there 's nothing remotely familiar about this setting . it 's either complete fantasy or some sort of alternative timeline kind of movie where there 's a war that 's been going on between humans and vampires forever . the human warriors are the `` priests '' - sort of a catholic clergy type -lrb- except that there are women in the order -rrb- who are governed by an all-powerful `` church '' that 's built huge walled cities to provide refuge to civilians from the vampires , and which govern with an iron fist . meanwhile , out on the frontier , vampires attack a homestead and capture a priest 's niece . he defies the orders of the church -lrb- and in this society to defy the church is to defy god -rrb- to rescue her . there 's a mishmash of concepts going on . it 's part apocalyptic ; it 's part western ; it 's part critique of religion and statement about religion 's potential abuses ; it 's even got elements of chinese martial arts movies in it . and , it 's part vampire stuff . there 's a lot of fighting , and it 's bloody -lrb- although i thought it might have been moreso . -rrb- i have to admit that it kind of lost me right off the top with a very long and rather silly animated narration that explained the history of this timeline . then , after losing me , it was just too way out to really draw me back in . i really did n't enjoy this . -lrb- 2/10 -rrb-		2		0
if there 's anything that italian horror directors do right , it 's making crazy movies ! before italian horror cinema took off in the mid to late 80s , a `` subtle little movie '' came along that capitalized on the emerging cannibal and zombie genres . this movie features a lot of the former and a little of the latter . ian was even so kind as to return in here , after surviving zombie ! when a string of murders and dismemberments plague new york hospitals , it is discovered that the perps are members of an ancient cannibal tribe . so it 's off to a tropical island -lrb- that looks remarkably like the same location for zombie , hm ... -rrb- where they discover a mad doctor -lrb- of course -rrb- doing what they do best ! acting is actually pretty good given what later movies would offer . the dialogue is still laughable . my personal favorite is when the good doctor speaks into a recorder , : `` patient 's screams forced me to remove the vocal cords . '' the gore is over-the-top with impalement and disemboweling being the preferred methods . the make-up for the seven or so zombies is pretty unconvincing -lrb- just slightly better than burial ground . -rrb- as with most euro-trash , this is best watched in the presence of your funniest friends !		2		0
i expected some pretty great things from the film doctor zhivago ; not only is it on the american film institute top 100 films of all time , but it has a pretty solid reputation as a good film . unfortunately , i have to vehemently disagree with this opinion . doctor zhivago is set during the russian revolution , a time when socialism was rising and personal freedoms were diminishing . this alone would be a fairly interesting topic , if it was done well , but this was a sweeping epic of a love story instead . zhivago -lrb- omar sharif -rrb- takes a wife , tonya -lrb- geraldine chaplin -rrb- and they have a child . during these formative years of their marriage , however , zhivago meets lara -lrb- julie christie -rrb- who enchants him . after ` resisting the attraction ' for a while , they meet up a couple of years later when tonya is pregnant again , and pretty much fall into bed within five minutes of reuniting . their affair is so obvious that when tonya is looking for zhivago at one point , the members of the village where lara lives all point her to his mistress ' house . charming , yes . i could have merely disliked the film because of the horrid ` romanticism ' if the rest of the film had any merit , but everything else is just as bad . i have now seen three david lean films , and have really enjoyed two of them : ` bridge on the river kwai ' and ` lawrence of arabia ' . for this reason , i was just stunned at how horrible this film is . the scene changes in ` zhivago ' are positively laughable -- many scenes are about thirty seconds long , and end abruptly , prompting me to internally -lrb- and eventually externally when it became apparent that we were all exasperated with this film -rrb- say , ` that was a great scene ' in the most dry manner possible . it got to the point where we were expecting someone to walk in the door and say , ` hello ' , and promptly have a quick fade out . there are too many things to support the ridiculousness of this film , but one more notable moment was a scene in which sir alec guinness , who was sporadically narrating the film , was talking about a moment when he was speaking to one of the characters . he was narrating the scene , and we are watching the action on the screen , with the narrator in the scene . it ended up looking absolutely absurd and seriously laugh-inducing . why lean could n't have just , oh , say done the scene without narration ? i will never know because there is no way , after writing this review i even want to mention this film ever again , so i am certainly not going to read about it . i 've passed the stage of morbid curiosity and have gone right to the denial stage . i want to deny this terrible movie ever passed over my retinas . i even indignantly confronted some family members at a recent family gathering who actually really liked this film and demanded they tell me why this is a good film , and the first thing every one of them said was that it was ` romantic ' . unfortunately , i was almost thrown out on my ear when i said , ` romantic ? romantic ?! it 's sleazy !!! ' before anyone accuses me of fanatical piety , let me remind any gentle readers that my favorite film of 2003 was kill bill vol . 1 and i laughed until i cried at the ` bang-up ' ending of ` intolerable cruelty ' , so the moral police i certainly am not . dr. zhivago was just ridiculously bad melodrama disguised as an epic because of its dramatic backdrop . i expected a lot and received worse than nothing ; a loathsome story and really bad filmmaking . -- shelly		2		0
ok ... this has to be one of the worst movie sequels ever ! first of all , at the end of the first movie , all the immortals are gone except for conner macleod ... including juan sanchez villa-lobos ramirez -lrb- sean connery -rrb- . so what is he doing back ? and why are there more immortals out there ? it should be over ! on top of not paying attention to the world they created , the writers also managed to come up with a bad script ! normally , i would give this movie a 1 , but i will say , the great fight sword fights and the cool quickening effects were there , so i have to bump it up to a 2 . by the way , true highlander fans refer to in one of three different ways : 1 . highlander ii : the sickening -lrb- hence , my summary ! -rrb- 2 . the movie we do not name 3 . they made a second highlander movie ? i thought they went right to the third !		2		0
for those of you reading at home , here are the ingredients to make your own `` killer shrew '' drink . chocolate ice cream captain crunch with crunch berries peanut m & ms mrs. butterworth circus peanuts mr. marshmallow peeps -lrb- lotsa marshmallow peeps -rrb- sweet tarts vanilla frosting wax lips -lrb- oops , nope , that is for the vulcan mind probe -rrb- `` alright , pour that into the plastic tulip glass , and garnish with a wind-up shrew ! '' the killer shrews without mike , joel , tom servo , tv 's frank , dr. forester , and crow is not a good movie . there is a reason why they chose this film to be a part of their mocking library . this `` horror '' film lacks in every critical category . it has shabby characters , very minimal visuals , sheep dogs in shrew costumes , and quite a bit of liquor consumption , while all the time never developing anything known as a `` plot '' . the basis behind this film is simple , honestly , too simple . a random , uncharted island inhabited by a scientific experiment gone wrong . there are only six `` survivors '' who were all doing fine until rosco p. coltrane -lrb- aka james best -rrb- arrived to the scene . it is after he arrives that liquor seems to be highly consumed , nerves never seemed to be unraveled , and more and more about these shrews are revealed . nearly halfway through this film i thought that henson might have been involved somehow with the creation of these shrews . there is even one scene in which there is a shrew hiding under the stairs , waiting for his prey , and you can not help but feel a sense of admiration for the beast . it is rather cute , in a costumed dog sort of way . this is one of the first films where you can watch the entire story unfold and feel nothing for these characters . director ray kellogg was either still writing the script as he was shooting or was hoping to use the phrase , `` it 's my first time directing '' for this silly excuse of a film . it is neither scary nor thrilling in any way . to begin , the visuals are horrendous . between the overused stock footage of a saber-toothed shrew peeking in through the wooden fence and the only one interior shot used in the film , it was bound to make any sane viewer go a bit bonkers . i realize that kellogg may have been trying to build the idea of entrapment or claustrophobia for his characters , but this sensation could never have been created with this cast . it became obvious to me early in this film that drinking was just as important as knowing your lines . in fact , if you did n't know your lines and chose to drink , director kellogg would have considered it a strong move on the part of the actor . the killer shrews is not a film for recovering alcoholics . let 's see if i have covered all the points . horrible acting . nobody actually has a character in this film . we learn nothing about anyone and feel nothing as they attempt to save their own lives from the killer shrews . there was one point in the film where ann asks thorne if he does n't wonder about everything and want to ask questions . she asks him if he does n't want to know about her accent . suddenly , i was whisked away to a lost memory and was waiting for all six of these character 's lives to suddenly be molded together in a rather shocking way , but alas , that did not happen . the creatures were creative , but definitely not scary , even for the late 1950s . the shrew under the stairs reminded me , to quote mystery science theater 3000 , like a puppet . it made me laugh , which is your typical viewer 's reaction to this type of cinema today . this was not a ed wood production in any way . this was far worse . acting was not necessary to be in this film . if there would have been any range of emotion emitted from anyone in this film than i may have graded it higher than i did , but alas , there was none . no chemistry between the characters , no drive , no excitement , just pure alcoholism . finally , there was the climactic ending that flies by faster than the beginning of the film . if the ending had been more intense , a bit spookier , and maybe even at night , than i think we would have had a stronger contender as a great film . sadly , the ending looked exactly like the rest of the film , cheap and subdued . overall , i do n't think i could watch this film again unless i had my old mst3k buddies with me to enjoy it . there was nothing of redeeming value in this film unless you count the action that the liquor bottles saw , then one would grade it higher . the shrews were laughable , the tension was non-existent , and the science of the film was never fully developed . there were so many avenues that kellogg could have traveled to make this into a `` cult '' phenomenon , but instead he stuck with less than mediocrity and the result is this black and white film that puts a horrid stain on the `` horror '' genre . instead , why do n't you make a `` killer shrew '' drink and call it a night , the results would be better ! grade : ** out of ***** -lrb- extra star for the mst3k memories -rrb-		2		0
a poor mans `` die hard '' if ever there was one . i thought `` olympus had fallen '' looked pretty rotten from its trailer , but i fell for several reviews that i read , telling me that it was apparently pretty good . those who said it was good , are wrong . those who say it just looks like `` die-hard in the whitehouse '' are probably more right than they realise . gerard butler tries to act all john mcclane , running into a terrorist infested building , and becoming the one man army that must stand up against them . but he 's no bruce willis . he attempts to pass of the same tough guy attitude , but ultimately fails . in one scene pointing out how unprofessional his superiors are being , before willingly giving away his position to the bad-guys by calling them up just to tease them . idiot ! now the movie does actually start of pretty promising , but by the end i was pulling my hair out . it essentially is just `` die-hard ! '' right down to a bad guy pretending he 's an escaped hostage , and sharing a cigarette with the hero . the awesome invasion that kicks off the movie soon leads to butler single handily taking on the 10 or so individual terrorists -lrb- even though it took hundreds of them to carry out the invasion -rrb- and a rescue attempt with a helicopter spectacularly fails , by getting blown up and having butler jumping out of the way to safety . i mean the titles even pretty rubbish is n't it . though i would probably have another reason to slate it if it was called `` hard to kill '' or `` hard target '' or something . as it is , `` olympus has fallen '' probably sums it up pretty well . what could have been half decent , has fallen to very low depths , with its lack of originality , and a plot that struggles to be credible in any way . on top of that , its riddled with terrible dialogue and an unbelievable over use of slow motion flags blowing in the wind . as cheesy as it gets this .		2		0
this movie is plain stupid . the characters are stupid the acting is stupid , the story is stupid , the visuals were stupid , the director was stupid if he though this would be a success , the actors were stupid if they thought joining this project would be a career boost and quite simply your stupid if you like this movie . you have typical character development and dull battle scenes as well as a stupid finale and definitely not enough gore . the whole tournament thing , i mean come on ! ca n't you think of anything a bit more realistic please ! do n't see this movie i beg of you , it is a waist of your time ! i do n't recommend it and i would actually rate in 1.5 / 10 . that is only because i think the girl sanaa lathan really gave it her all in this movie , otherwise i would give it a zero .		2		0
messiah of evil finds young marianna hill coming to a small pacific coast town to pay a visit to her father royal dano . dano 's a noted artist of sorts who 's not around , but a lot of his paintings are and they 're portraying some really scary scenes , not anything like the still life stuff he 's noted for . in this terrible ripoff of invasion of the body snatchers the normal populace of this town is growing smaller and smaller with folks catching the zombie disease or just being eaten by same . when there are no normals around that does n't diminish anything for the zombies they just snack on whoever 's available . there 's a kind of zombie messiah supposed to return which is the reason they 're hanging around . if you 're curious you might want to sit through this claptrap to see if the messiah of evil makes it back .		2		0
ok , i first have o admit that i was coerced into seeing this movie . i had heard many good things about it , and the fact that it was n't an america vs. movie intrigued me . i hoped that this would be an evenly told story that had no ulterior motives . boy was i wrong . this movie is probably one of the most obvious pieces of pro-war propaganda since john wayne was alive . `` u-571 '' is a little close , but nowhere near as obvious as this . morals of the story : germans were bad , russians were good , sex leads to failure . that last one could be derived from the result of one of the funniest , and most gratuitous sex scenes in film history -lrb- including caligula -rrb- . what happened because of death ? the hero could n't perform his duties . i liked the fact that everybody spoke english . but , that paled in comparison to the fact that finnes had a constant shadow , but was never clean shaven . that was amusing . the love story was lacking , the war story was lacking , about the only thing that was n't lacking was the strange accents . the best part of the movie was that it was about propaganda . i do n't know if that was supposed to have any sort of effect on the final shot . ****** spoilers ******** the final shot was the ultra hero shot . with finnes looking up and to the right -lrb- with his head at the left side of the screen -rrb- , and the light glowing from the right side of the screen in his face . he 's superman !! bleh . also , the foreshadowing was obvious , the movie was put together so horribly that i found nothing intriguing about it . russians are going to win , fiennes will be the result , he 'll get the girl . if you want a good war movie , rent full metal jacket , apocolypse now , the thin red line . something not so obvious . do n't rent this tripe . 2/10		2		0
dr. zhivago concerns a bright , privileged figure who should 've risen to the ranks of the russian cognoscenti , but the decades-long revolution consumes the entirety of his life . this long story tracks the random , glancing interactions of 4 or 5 major players . but those moments deliver little of the frisson they might . director david lean is on autopilot , and assumes viewers are interested . but the movie has very little forward momentum and is about as involving as a chart . it never develops a center . and there 's no getting around the fact that omar sharif is miscast . even he was surprised when lean offered him the title role . -lrb- he was seeking a smaller part -rrb- sharif hits his marks and no more . he has no presence or weight ; and he makes you wonder why a very long book was written about this vague , empty character . additionally , a is lost in the middle of all this . rita tushingham , was apparently cast for her ability to bulge her eyes ambiguously for hours on end . megahit ` somewhere , my love ' is intoned continually despite the fact that it undermines things .		2		0
star rating : ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning a young girl with an incredible mathematical ability finds her talents pursued by ruthless criminals , as well as finding out the second part of a set of numbers that hold the combination to something big . she crosses paths with luke wright -lrb- jason statham -rrb- , a former cop turned cage fighter who charges himself with protecting the girl and bringing down those assailing her . i got ta admit , i 'm no great fan of statham . i find his movies at best give and take , and when they 're as low grade as this , a curious piece of work indeed . they seem to pop up out of nowhere , and it 's a wonder more of them have n't gone straight to dvd , but they always seem to find their way to the big screen before disc format , where i tend to watch them . the main reason you watch a statham film is the action , and this particular one seems to have it just popping up here and there , mainly in the shape of ludicrous fast paced , hard punching fight scenes where our hero inexplicably beats many bad guys all at once to a pulp , as well as summarily executing some others . in between , we have to contend with a confusing , incoherent story and a flat , humourless screenplay . not one of my favourites . and given we 're talking about statham movies , that 's saying something . *		2		0
... that `` the matrix '' got released first and had a comprehensible plot . `` the thirteenth floor '' , presumably about fake and/or simulated realities , is just plain boring . i spent half the movie trying to figure out what was going on . gretchen mol went from the mind-numbing `` rounders '' * to this , and craig bierko , armin mueller-stahl , vincent d'onofrio and dennis haysbert sure did n't do themselves any favors by starring in this . that 's 100 minutes that i 'll never get back . not even a showing on `` mystery science theater 3000 '' could improve this crap . do n't waste your time . * some idiots actually interpreted that as a `` good will hunting '' remake !		2		0
the only thing that the bone collector contributes to the world of cinema is gruesome detail and violence , following a story of investigators tracking down a murderer who steals the bones off his victims ... and just finds new and creative ways to murder people . there is n't much more that this film has to offer outside violence - and angelina jolie . i definitely wo n't be putting this film into my collection . the dialogue , characters , and relationships come out as rather silly , and the only thing this film seems to do well is to portray grim detail and shock value . i 'd give it a miss unless you are hooked on very gruesome films .		2		0
for a film comedy , this may be one of the all-time sleaziest movies ever made . they just made it under the wire , too , as , by the mid '80s the ultra-sleazy movies like this were history . they lasted from 1970 to about 1984 . for 1982 , this was `` pushing the envelope . '' there is hardly a sentence in this script that is n't dotted with a profane word and all anyone in the film - anyone - cares about is sex . hey , who is n't in that it some for or another , but this is a mainline film and that 's all that mattered in here . even more ludicrous and insulting is that it 's about high school-age kids -lrb- who all look about 25 years old in this film -rrb- ! when you are young , stupid and devoid of morals , this is a `` cool '' movie . i thought it was 25 years ago when i first saw it , to be perfectly honest . yes , even that classic scene in the shower room with the bulldog gym teaching pulling on this guy was funny ... but not now . this film looks sophomoric to me now that it 's embarrassing . i guess it depends on when in life you watch it . anybody over 40 who still watches this needs counseling . this movie should be put in a time capsule to show how low hollywood had plummeted by 1982 .		2		0
it has only been recently that uwe boll 's seeming masterpiece , alone in the dark , has been available here for rental . it completely bypassed local theatres , and was available on dvd in america at least a year before here , which is rarely a good sign . unlike boll 's previous effort , house of the dead , the problem is not so much in the performances or even the special effects . the real problem lies in the direction and editing . articles have since sprung out of the woodwork describing boll 's inflated and inability to work effectively with collaborators . it seems that this includes actors . reid and slater do their best with the roles that they have been assigned , but it becomes clear that they are given very little direction throughout the film . at one point , slater and reid appear to be running from the alien-like creatures of the story through a warehouse . to say that they interact very little with their surroundings is an understatement . this scene could have been more convincing , in fact , if they had been running across a floor with a rear-projection behind them . no , the real problem in this film lies in the direction and editing . a sex scene appears with no linking into the preceding or following scenes . adding to the film 's woes is that test audiences were so confused by the plot that an opening crawl had to be added in order to make the plot easier to follow . said plot basically follows christian slater , who looks nothing like the edward carnby of the video games , as he deals with supernatural creatures emerging in our plane of existence and a government agency attempting to deal with them . exactly where this plot stems from , i do not know , and i have only briefly played one of the games , but i do not remember any of the embellishments boll has provided -lrb- which telegraph themselves with fervor -rrb- . compounding the problem is that boll requires his actors to describe the plot or the point of what we have seen in the scenes . that none of the plot can be inferred through the images makes boll 's incompetence as a director pretty obvious . to hear it from boll during the featurette , atari contacted him and asked him to adapt the game into film . the nonsense of this spin is shown by what outsiders have to boll and his films . the writers of a rejected screenplay for house of the dead decided that they would rather remain in obscurity than become famous for working with boll . speaking as a writer myself , this tells me far more about boll as a filmmaker than a million featurettes from the lousy dvds made of his lousy films ever could . adding insult to injury is that nuclear blast paid boll and his cohorts enough money to make an album in order to have a few of their bands included in the soundtrack . if there were justice in the world , nuclear blast would be one of the many record labels sony by a twelve to one ratio . they are innovators , and have released some masterpieces from the likes of or . that they have to slum it in dreck like this while sony saturates the market in their repetitive garbage only adds further insult to alone in the dark . i hope that thirty grand could be written off easily . soundtracks and bad direction aside , the construction of the film is utterly terrible , too . i can not really describe the ending for fear of ruining what little surprise the film has , but i bet that uwe was paying very careful attention to the end of resident evil . it is a pity he did not learn that such images only work because of the context they are in , and that context needs to make a certain level of sense . i know it sounds hypocritical of me to call for a film to guide the audience through the plot , but at the very least , alone in the dark could have given a small trail , anything to make point a follow logically from point b , so to speak . the idea that we are meant to follow all this action going on in such a confined space , and then accept that some survivor got out and destroyed everyone -lrb- even the meaning of everyone is left pretty vague in this film -rrb- is pretty ludicrous . others have described the patent unbelievability of tara reid as an archaeologist , but this is in fact one of the least of the film 's problems . i gave alone in the dark a two out of ten . as a horror film , it is far too tame to horrify . as an action film , it is too stagnant to move the audience . as a serious acting piece , it has no drama to speak of . without the lousy or idiotic production decisions , it also loses the unintentional comedy that made house of the dead bearable . in essence , it winds up in no man 's land . see it if you need an example of how one man can be so blind to his own incompetence .		2		0
i 'm not even sure it 's worth the commentary , but here goes : this film had to take the time to explain a convoluted back story before the film started , just so it would n't have to bother with such trivial things as ` plot ' and ` story ' once it was up and running . it 's fragmented and disjointed , with scenes that have little to do with each other , horribly transposed upon each other , with little transition . it 's full of generic and ` mandatory ' scenes that do little to further the plot . like the sex scene - its only purpose in the film was to show off tara reid in a bra , and frankly i can get that online in 30 seconds , i do n't need to waste an hour forty-five for a thirty second , ridiculously out-of-place , on-screen roll in the hay . and there are a couple of moments of gore , which belong in dawn of the dead , not an sci-fi action film . frankly , this film would n't even make a good video game - it does n't hold a candle to the playstation game it 's based on . it 's too hackneyed ; a string of second-rate action sequences held together by grand plot holes and some of the worst dialogue i 've ever encountered . not to mention heavy over-emoting by the good il ' evil doctor villain character , and the bad-ass military character , the latter played by stephen dorff , who suddenly goes from irritating power-hungry jerk-off to heroic military buddy . and i have n't even touched on the lack of character background , lack of chemistry , or the shallow attempts to use strobes and lots of machine gun fire to hide the lack of cgi effects . guess the budget just was n't high enough . do yourself a favour , just rent aliens instead . 1.5 / 10 - and only because , sadly enough , i 've actually seen one or two films that are worse .		2		0
antoine fuqua had already directed two movies before `` training day '' got him some notice -lrb- and won denzel washington a best actor oscar -rrb- . since then all of fuqua 's movies have been total popcorn movies . the latest is `` olympus has fallen '' , which is basically everything that we saw in wolfgang petersen 's `` air force one '' transposed to the white house . terrorists have taken over ? no problem ! one person single-handedly takes them on . yeah , i know . this movie does n't pretend to be anything that it is n't . sorry but there are stories that have n't gotten filmed . this is just a dumb movie . i 'd like to see an adaptation of kim stanley robinson 's `` years of rice and salt '' . and i 'd like to see michael apted 's `` stardust '' and jack starrett 's `` gravy train '' -lrb- both of which got released in the theaters but never got released on vhs -rrb- get released on dvd .		2		0
spoilers !! my wife picked this movie , and now i will pick the next one . you will need prozac after watching this depressing tripe . i know this movie has a social message etc , but i believe that gives the producers no excuse to destroy reason . i do not want to be mean to hopkins , but how can hopkins play a black man from two black parents . genetically this is not possible . with this reasoning they could of had jackie chan playing hopkins role . the reverse would be having a black child from two white parents . when this plot twist finally arrived , i said to myself `` i do n't get it . it 's not possible . '' hopkins did play a good self absorbed in love with himself university prof. i guess the film was trying to say that race made him that way . i think he was just a jerk to begin with being so selfish . it is hard to have any sympathy for this person seeing that he was ashamed of his family and community and wanted nothing to do with them . usually , people have a sense of comfort with their family or community . if a person runs from one 's family , there has be some . nicole kidman plays white trash to the tee and no one wants to see this . i have to put up with this at work daily . ed harris plays a wacko . everyone blames their problems on other people and takes no responsibility for their own actions . everyone believes that it is okay to behave in a selfish manner . i had no sympathy for any of the characters . 2/10		2		0
this is a good but by no means great film that highlights british youth culture through the eyes of mia . it has a good enough story and some nice moments but it can not be ignored that the mass amounts of swearing and sex references and in one case sex scenes are not needed and get in the way of this film being truly great . all the cast give good performances and this film will probably live on forever as a text discussed at a2 media level but will never be remembered in years to come as being a great example of independent cinema or film making because it appeals to too much of a niche market .		2		0
basically , the kind of overly simplistic , tv movie of the week story you 'd expect from basic network tv or from the formula hollywood films that also end up making little or no stop at theaters . besides being boring and predictable , it lacks any significant meaning . it 's difficult to fill up 10 lines for imdb describing in detail what i 'd prefer to forget . the acting is n't bad , as you 'd expect from the actors involved -lrb- though you 'll ask yourself why they 'd be involved at all with this -rrb- . there are issues , like brosnan 's voice sometimes feels like a voice-over , and it 's difficult to tell if he 's supposed to be doing an irish or scottish accent . given the way the film is largely talk driven and his talking is featured , you 'd think there 'd be some significance to it , but it does n't really matter . the single biggest problem besides the shallow , imitative , factory-made story is the lack of plot development . i suppose they thought it added suspense and mystery . it just made it seem completely unthought through .		2		0
i pass on most remakes these days , as they 're usually of forgettable junk that was n't worth an original . but just the mention of `` halloween '' , evokes the beginning of a genre that 's still running strong 30 years later . unfortunately , overrated hairball zombie has made this look like one of the many slasher knock-offs from the 1980s . populated by unsavory and obnoxious characters , i swear to you not one -- not one ! -- character did i care anything about , if they lived , died , screwed , puked . nothing . an insulting barrage of tasteless , endless dialogue throughout , involving verbal abuse , put-downs , and unrealistic references by 12-year-olds of semen being pumped from a female stomach . eye-roller to the extreme from zombie 's screenplay . and i was constantly griping at the screen as to what time period this takes place in . 70s music and fashions abound , but then there are cell phones and , f-bomb laced dialogue uncharacteristic of any time period . i know we have mouths in the world , but this was stunningly excessive . early 90s ? late 70s ? got me . his main approach , though , falls even flatter , as he tried to expand on the origin that is michael myers . this leads to an overextended 45-minute trailer trash sequence of events , that just come off more embarrassing than engrossing . finally , zombie arrives at the point where myers is an adult , but then must shoehorn a majority of the original film into the final 45 minutes here . this leads to a rushed middle portion , completely lacking in suspense or tension . only to be finished with an ending that had absolutely no direction and went on forever . as far as technical aspects , a real mess there as well . constant dramamine , shaky-cam moments , totally telegraphed kills -lrb- old and young myers is always shown in the background -rrb- , and grating performances that annoy . mcdowell as loomis comes off the worst , with donald pleasance towering high over his understudy . taylor-compton a laurie strode , with her appearance and valley girl line readings . plus other cookie cutter who we care nary an iota about . sadly , one is a good in danielle harris , the of halloween 's 4 and 5 , here playing a convincing teen at the age of 30 . well , appearance wise . performance wise , kinda stiff , and that 's not a pun intended considering her lengthy topless scene , mostly covered in blood . biggest of all are the myers actors , the first a pudgy , stringy-haired brat who brings an uncomfortability in watching him hack up a bunch of loutish wrong-doers in his life . then , as an adult , myers annoyingly resembling wrestling 's the undertaker , with blond locks hiding his mug . plus the implausible fact that , though lying motionless for years in a nuthouse , he has the power to tear through walls and withstand gunshots . after reading the above you get the impression as to why this was not a horror experience , but more of an exercise in viewer distractions to be counted . i coil in fear at the thought of michael bay 's `` friday the 13th '' remake due out next year . lord , help us .		2		0
this movie is just retarded . it 's basically nothing more than a badly acted vehicle for pro wrestler john cena to star in a poorly written die hard with a vengeance ripoff . i was pretty excited when i heard was this was going to be about , but unfortunately it is bogged down horribly by very poor acting , which leads to shallow characters and poorly delivered lines , which leads to the death of any tension that could possibly come from the movie 's plot . also , when die hard with a vengeance did this , they had like three or four challenges that bruce willis had to do , and they were stretched out over a long period of time ; generally exciting and fun to watch . with this movie , it 's twelve challenges , and they 're all done in rapid succession . this movie is n't believable , it is n't exciting and it is n't endearing . does any of this sound good to you ? i did n't think so .		2		0
a couple of months ago my boyfriend told me about a trailer that really scared him , the fourth kind . so we went to the movies and i saw the trailer as well , even though i did n't have the same reaction as he did , i was kind of intrigued . who does n't love a good sci-fi thriller ? so we saw this opening weekend and this was a major disappointment on every level . first , we have milla jovovich coming on screen and introducing herself saying that this is a true story and she 's portraying a real life doctor who went through the events that she 's about to show . so i 'm thinking `` ok , even though this is bs , i 'll go with it '' , then it automatically goes into split screen . i 'm thinking `` um , ok , is this a documentary , a movie or america 's most wanted ? '' . this movie was nothing but a split screen trying to insult the audience 's intelligence by making it look like it 's based on a true story . the fourth kind is set in modern-day nome , alaska , since the disproportionate number of the population has been reported missing every year . despite multiple fbi investigations of the region , the truth has never been discovered . here in this remote region , psychologist dr. abigail tyler began videotaping sessions with traumatized patients and unwittingly discovered some of the most disturbing evidence of alien abduction ever documented . using never-before-seen archival footage that is integrated into the film , the fourth kind exposes the terrified revelations of multiple witnesses . their accounts of being visited by alien figures all share disturbingly identical details , the validity of which is investigated throughout the film . the film ends with the director coming on the screen saying `` believe what you want '' , and it 's a total slap to the face . this is a fictional story because if it was real , we would 've heard something about it , especially with today 's age of the internet . another problem is the way the film was made , it 's pretty much all split screen and is too much on the eyes . what i would 've done if i made this film , i would 've made it just as a regular film . then introduce `` the real doctor '' at the end and show `` the real footage '' . because we 've already seen the reenacted footage , why not then compare at the end ? also the actress who played `` the real doctor '' , oh , my gosh , could they have picked someone more annoying ? i understand what she was trying to do , but her droning on the script with her zombie like voice and appearance was just awful . the acting pretty much on everyone 's part is awful , because this movie was taken too seriously when it had so much potential . the story just had a lot of flaws . the patients are having these nightmares and one of them really looses it and kills his family and himself for no reason what so ever , have no idea what his motivations were other than maybe him trying to protect them from the abduction , i do n't know . the sheriff asks dr. tyler what the patients have been telling her and what is going on , for some reason he 's blaming her for the murder/suicide . she put the patients in a hypnosis , but she did n't know the outcome , so how could the sheriff blame her ? then another patient she puts under hypnosis , his body contorts and paralyzes him , the sheriff then threatens to arrest her ? why ? i do n't get it ! he has no right . nothing about this movie made any sense and was a waste of my time . i suggest you skip it , it 's trash and deserved better than what this director did to it . it could have been a fun alien flick and turned into a total joke . 2/10		2		0
i watched this film last night and can not figure out , for the life of me , what all the `` hype '' is about . yes , we all love johnny depp , and many will say the same about kate winslet as well . however , not even these two talented performers can save this `` clunker '' from being the dreadful bore that it is . j.m. barrie -lrb- depp -rrb- is a london playwright in 1903 . while writing in the park as he often does , he happens to stumble across sylvia llewelyn davies -lrb- winslet -rrb- and her four children . immediately taking a liking to them , he begins a relationship with the troop , which in return , gives him the inspiration to write `` peter pan '' . first of all , does anyone really care ? the character of j.m. barrie for a full length feature film , just does n't hold up . what is the surprise that a writer , while running around with 4 boys all day playing cowboys and indians , would n't start to get some kind of creative juice flowing ? does n't take a genius to figure that out !! i found it very odd that j.m. barrie was a married man , yet he spent all his free time running around with a widows children that are n't even his own ? barrie never even develops a romance with davies , he simply plays with her kids all day long . yet he refuses to introduce his wife to the family , nor involve her in any of his imaginative `` play dates '' . it 's almost as if he is having a love affair with these children , but not with their mother . if someone were to do that by today 's standards , people would be in an uproar . i side with davies mother mrs. emma du maurier -lrb- julie christie -rrb- , who thinks the whole ordeal is outlandish , and that barrie should back off , letting davies -lrb- a widow -rrb- and the children , move on with their life . after all , he is a married & successful playwright , with a life of his own . of course , the children have become completely attached to barrie , not realizing that when his writing is all said and done , the relationship with barrie is more than likely to dissipate . well , that 's not what happens , due to the fact that davies has a secret illness -lrb- the cause never revealed -rrb- that will eventually take her own life . she starts out with a little cough here and there , then suddenly becomes too weak to leave the house and then ... well you can guess the rest . it all happens rather quickly , without even a good explanation to the cause of her illness in the first place . summed up in a nutshell : man meets kids , man plays with kids , man enjoys spending time with surrogate family more than own wife , man writes play , wife leaves husband , play becomes timeless classic , children 's ' mother dies , man gets joint custody of kids . zzzzzzzzzzz !! i found the entire movie to be pretty boring . a romance with winslet is never developed , although at times it is hinted that depp has really fallen for her . however , they never even kiss in the film , so it is all speculation really . the children in the film are like any children by todays standards ; creative , spunky and full of energy . one is named peter , and of course , peter and barrie have the strongest bond with each other . i feel that despite the two talented leads , this movie has nothing to offer really . the relationship amongst all the characters is presented in incomplete fashion throughout the entire film . the story of j.m. barrie 's creative inspiration for writing peter pan is really not that interesting , entertaining , or moving enough to sit through for 106 minutes . i balk at the fact this movie was nominated for an academy award for best picture and would suggest anyone interested in this dribble just pick up a copy of `` peter pan '' -lrb- written or filmed -rrb- instead ! the story of peter pan is far more interesting than the story of the man who wrote it .		2		0
a predictable eli roth movie . which basically means you 're better off watching something else . after being boasted as `` the sickest thing you will ever see '' by blabber mouth director . i was n't looking forward to this after the disappointment which was cabin fever but me and some friends decided to go and see it anyway . maybe we should of thought twice . the story is that while backpacking through europe , college students paxton -lrb- jay hernandez -rrb- and josh -lrb- derek richardson -rrb- seek the ultimate vacation through sex , drugs and unforgettable experiences . when a friendly stranger informs the two of a hostel in bratislava that offers the most beautiful and promiscuous women in all of europe , paxton and derek trek with their new icelandic friend oli -lrb- eythor gudjonsson -rrb- to find the hostel that sounds too good to be true . when arriving to bratislava , the trio found that the hostel was everything and more of what they expected . the events that follow are sure to deliver the unforgettable vacation that the two were looking for . mystery , suspense and fear direct this film to its bloody ending . hostel has a great idea , sick but great it 's just too bad it was brought to the screen in with such a shoddy attempt . i was expecting cheap thrills and i got cheap thrills , but those cheap thrills came along with one of the most cheesy , tacky and stupid movie i have seen . this film is not once sophisticated . and not even that gory . his movie is completely charmless and probably more of a disappointment than cabin fever . the actors are n't terrible but they are n't anything special , the constant boobs ! are unnecessary and is just a time waster . the characters were annoying and you truly did n't give a damn what happened to any of them ! please just avoid this film . its eli roth 's exercise in car crash cinema and boy does it crash and burn . the only real thing hostel manages to get right is the shameless promotional attempt by putting master director quentin tarentino -lrb- kill bill , pulp fiction -rrb- on the front cover which is sure to make movie goers part with their money . please i urge you this is no more than a rental and even that 's pushing its luck . blabbermouth director roth has done it again . cabin fever still remains one of the dullest duds ever made . he promised us blood we got humour . now it has a friend to join it . hostel is equally -lrb- unintentionally funny -rrb- as a run of the mill horror film `` hostel '' does no wrong . but for reel spills and chills your best off watching something masterfully crafted and even mildly gripping . two things hostel lacks . it 's interesting premise aside i ca n't really say anything productive about hostel . this really is n't anything that you have n't seen a hundred times this year . what 's even scarier is the sequel prepped for meaning roth gets to splash some more blood around . it 's a good money maker so i would n't be surprised if this series keeps going much like the highly worn saw series .		2		0
the new columbia pictures pg-13 rated remake of cult director john carpenter 's r-rated 1980 horror epic `` the fog '' -lrb- * out of **** -rrb- proves that an $ 18 million dollar budget , an incoherent script , and the obvious use of cgi can not make up for a shortage of nail-biting suspense and chills . although a pg-13 rating opens `` the fog '' up to younger viewers , the drastic in blood and gore as well as the intensity with which the filmmakers serve up their shocks dilutes the fear factor . aside from fewer than five white-knuckled moments , this remake of `` the fog '' neither makes your skin crawl nor raises the hair on the back of your neck like its imaginative predecessor . worse , the cgi special effects look hopelessly phony . a death scene where razor-sharp glass shards impale a guy owes more to the `` final destination '' movies . indeed , staging death scenes as elaborate gimmicks deprives the tragic act of its horror . you do n't think about how gruesome such a death is so much as you marvel at the expertise with which the filmmakers orchestrated the live-action effects with the computer-generated ones . `` stigmata '' director rupert wainwright and writer cooper layne of `` the core '' have ramped up the evil power of the title antagonist . the ` new ' fog can suck adults back through windows and turn seaweed into tentacles of terror ! `` the fog '' unfolds on the eve of the centennial celebration of the founding of the island town of antonio bay in oregon . california provided the setting in carpenter 's original . as officials finalize the festivities , strange things begin to occur . a massive fog bank drifting against the wind lays siege to the scenic island . not only does the fog shroud party-goers on a fishing boat in its homicidal haze , but this atmospheric phenomenon acts as a smoke screen for a spooky clipper ship manned by zombies . sometimes , the undead show up as ghosts or as zombies . inexplicably , ordinary objects defy gravity and become lethal weapons . repeatedly , we learn that the treacherous antonio bay officials arranged a deal to sell land to a colony of wealthy lepers . these officials then cheated the lepers , plundered their valuables , torched their ship , and left them to drown in the murky waters of antonio bay . one hundred years later , the undead demand payback . wainwright and layne shun a shot-by-shot remake of the carpenter classic , but their changes undermine the whole enterprise . some alterations have legitimacy but others do n't pass muster . in carpenter 's version , when the fog crept in , its supernatural force made a bank of pay telephones ring off the hook . pay telephones are today an endangered species . unfortunately , several changes appear arbitrary and done simply to differentiate the movies . the female lead discovers the murderous clergyman 's diary in the remake rather than the priest in the original . incredibly , wainwright and layne include a subplot with no closure that did n't appear in the first film . in their `` fog , ' one of the principals is related to the dead lepers . meanwhile , they add an entirely new character solely in the name of multiculturalism . african-american comic deray davis of `` johnson family vacation '' plays a mike epps wannabe and possesses none of the talent that legendary african-american comic mantan moreland brought to similar roles in 1940s ' horror chillers . the new `` fog '' packs its cast with pretty people who would look more comfortable modeling lingerie than mingling with zombies . young superman stars tom welling of `` smallville '' fame and `` lost 's '' maggie grace headline a largely unknown cast . they appear to have been chosen more for their flawless skin than their acting chops . the only recognizable talent -- selma blair of `` hellboy '' -- wears enough eye-liner to pass as a raccoon . moreover , she appears far too young to have an elementary school-age son . veteran character rade serbedzija of `` euro-trip '' is the only notable actor of any stature , but he languishes in a backstory role . wainwright and layne have tailored their `` fog '' to audiences that can cope with an occasional jolt and prefer to see nothing that might be unpleasant . if you prefer horror movies , the new remake of `` the fog '' may be your cup of poison . as for hardcore gorehounds , `` the fog . '' this refers to the theatrical version .		2		0
this film was a massive disappointment . from both an entertaining aspect and the storytelling aspect , it just never really got off the ground . there were too many elements that went untouched that should have either been explained or explored . instead , we are forced through a film without any directions and a horrible guide . i personally got lost twice trying to find my way out of there . there was some potential in white noise , but sadly it never was shown the light of day . the concept behind the film is absurd . the ability to hear the dead through your computer or vcr seemed a bit archaic to me . this was a very modern film , yet we are forced to possibly see the spirits through beta ... i kept waiting for that important scene to switch this entire film around . alas , it never evolved . so , instead , i am forced to watch michael keaton fumble his way through an already pathetic film and experience some of the least frightening -lrb- mostly due to do underdevelopment -rrb- ghosts that the horror genre had to offer . i would rank these below casper ... and he was a friendly ghost . the issue arrives very early into the film . we are shown brief images of these three shadows that constantly had me thinking of the `` smoking man '' in x-files . who were these spirits ? why were they just watching ? what were they doing on television ? simple questions that you would think would be answered immediately throughout the film -lrb- because they are a big element to the ending -rrb- , but no , nothing is explained . these three shadows are used as a technique early in the film to make audiences jump in their seats while never quite explaining who or what they are . then , as if we are to already know what they are , they are used near the end for a very important scene . this left me boggled . in fact , the entire ending left me boggled . i am not going into detail here because others would be upset , but the entire ending seemed that director geoffrey sax wanted to incorporate several different techniques from several different styles of film into one anticlimactic ending . it was poorly executed and very badly conceived . it will not end with a great taste in your mouth . so , with the choppy spiritual aspect and the abruptly bad ending , i bet you are thinking that at least keaton could carry this film . wrong . this seemed like it was the most difficult film for keaton to handle . i am not sure if it was the emotional moments that did n't settle well with him or if it was the fact that he had to use expression on his face instead of reading his lines that ruined his performance here , but either way he was disastrous . from the opening scene of this film , you never really saw keaton as anyone other than michael keaton . the moments between he and his wife seemed forced and rather hollywood created , which overall impacted the rest of the film for me . why would this man want to hear his wife if he was n't really in love with her ? bring that element into the picture and i think sax would have had a stronger picture . secondly , does anyone else get tired of witnessing grown men never go to work yet have the most lavish lifestyle ? as a retail working man , i thought this completely ruined any reality that this film was trying to build . a man who wishes to live a trendy lifestyle needs to work , and keaton -lrb- after about the first ten minutes of this film -rrb- never went back to work . to me , that was depressing and unbelievable . keaton did not cut it at all in this film , but then again , neither did his co-stars . the choice to use deborah kara unger was smart , but we needed to give more to her . she is a spooky woman that almost carried the game away from michael douglas , but somehow was completely forgotten about throughout this film . i understand that keaton was supposed to be the central focus , but she was a huge element in helping him understand evp , so why not give her more screen time . then there was ian mcneice , who quite possibly wasted his talent on this film . he is a decent actor that showed us that bad screen writing can still sound bad from the mouth of even decent actors . nobody in this film seemed to have the energy or excitement that was needed to make this film worth watching again , and again , and again . finally , the story was as shallow as the local kiddy pool . director sax had us jumping from one moment to the next , confusing even the most novice of film watchers and horror enthusiasts . you could tell that he had so much information , so many ideas , that he wanted to get out on the screen that he dropped some crucial elements and completely forgot about some other ones . finally , when we do get to the ending , we are so turned around and unexcited that laughter seems the only response one could give . for this story to work stronger there was a need for better actors , a tighter script , and more development of those three shadows that still have me scratching my head . just like in the x-files none of my questions were answered . grade : * out of *****		2		0
totally worthless sequel to the first equally worthless movie . the plot is stupid -lrb- it makes one of the old episodes of the tv series seem like shakespeare -rrb- ; the movie is chock full of deafening explosions and needlessly loud special effects -lrb- i had to cover my ears once -rrb- ; the jokes are abysmal -lrb- i groaned aloud at a few -rrb- and contained some stunts that were so over the top i actually yelled `` oh come on ! '' a few times -lrb- but nobody could hear me over the soundtrack . also the sexism is in high gear -lrb- again -rrb- . purportedly we 're supposed to applaud this movie because it shows strong , intelligent women single handedly beating up bad guys . true -- that is good . but they 're always dressed in very tight or revealing clothes -lrb- of course there 's the required beach sequence when they 're all in bikinis -rrb- , and are constantly having water thrown on them or are inexplicably getting wet -lrb- notice how conveniently the water sprinklers start when they 're walking over a lawn -rrb- . this happens all throughout the movie and got annoying . drew barrymore , cameron diaz and lucy liu are as good as anyone could be and bernie mack , robert patrick and matt leblanc were very good in supporting roles . and it 's great to see demi moore back in films -lrb- even if she still ca n't act -rrb- . the songs in the movie were good and i must admit the stunts , while very stupid , were . still , i hated this movie . i guess my taste for mindless , loud summer movies has peaked . this should be avoided . notice ... the majority of people voting on this gave it a 1 .		2		0
this recent flick shows how foolish the cinema public must be . what a dumb story with pieces just illogically jammed together for effective stupidity aura effects . where do i start with this thing that is written so clumsily . first a millionaire who does who knows what for work , has his child and wife murdered before his eyes . he later takes booze and pills , but is rescued by of all unbelievable people a crazy doctor who just knows this dude has had an near death experience . well , the filler tends to give the viewer an idea of how crazy this flick is getting . the doc specializes in and soon has a heart attack so he is removed as a character . later a crazy , improbable nurse , takes abe , in for re sex training . gosh ! and from here i just had my own nde from an over dose of cinema stupid and turned the thing off . buy this as i did on dvd . surely their is something better you could do with your life , such as clean the cat 's box ?		2		0
millions , two huge stars , a director with a reputation and a fictional sounding name , and of course , venice ! nothing works , nothing ! the chemistry between depp and jolie is virtually non existent . she is dressed in ridiculous , supposedly elegant , gowns but she looks as if she 's wearing costumes . remember audrey hepburn ? she was never worn by her dresses , she was ahead . the dialog is not to be believed - julian fellowes is listed among the writers but , i ca n't believe it 's true . the meet-cute on the train , done so beautifully in th past by a variety of directors and stars , falls flat here , flat ! johnny depp is one of my favorites but here he looks puffy and detached . how can anyone managed to make depp look bad ? i do n't know but they did . jolie is a big star but here , she seems unused to wear dresses . i could n't believe her walk through venice . `` hot to trot '' comes o mind . imagine , audrey hepburn walking purposely through venice in a ball gown . or carole lombard , or grace kelly , or loren or deneuve , gene tirney , kay kendall ... i can think of dozens . this was really bad . the only saving grace a running joke that has depp 's character , not speaking italian , speaks spanish to the italians and the italians respond in spanish , specially the scene with christian de sica -lrb- son of vittorio -rrb- in which de sica replays `` de nada '' so , the lesson learned is the eternal cliché . not everything that glitters is gold . and this one , from a distance , glittered , big time		2		0
eddie albert must have read my mind when he asks tom skerritt in one scene where they come into a ghost town , `` the devil 's rain ? that 's a new one . '' i myself had never heard of such nonsense -- maybe because as far as i know , there is no such thing and the only earthbound element that the devil is associated with is the `` fire and brimstone '' of dark , poems and the well-known `` garden of earthly delights '' of hieronymous bosch , featured in the opening titles . but this is what happens when you make a smashing success like `` rosemary 's baby '' and `` the exorcist . '' all of the waste product tries to jump in on the bandwagon and see what profit they can make by luring unsuspecting fools into the theatre and showing them an exploitation film about satanists -- which is all this movie is , anyway . so let 's see what we have here . a plot to gain control of a book and a battle between the devil himself -lrb- channeled , apparently , through the body of john corbis -rrb- and the preston family . first the father goes , melting into a soft bubbling goo . then the mother -- played by an unrecognizable , tired-looking ida lupino -- also is forced to join the cult and put some cheap-looking that are supposed to make her eyes black . then it becomes william shatner 's turn , and he goes , but without a fight . finally , it 's up to tom skerritt and eddie albert to see if they can have a hand in winning this battle and going home with some really cool prizes , to which we get to the only character who does basically nothing but have a lame vision and scream mindlessly at the end : skerritt 's wife . a terrifically lazy story that was , apparently , written on autopilot . the devil 's rain is a total bore and as horror as edgar allan poe is screwball comedy , but there it is , existing in the time period of the height of the horror genre , featuring a hammy performance from ernest `` marty '' borgnine , a blink and miss appearance of john travolta as he yells `` blasphemer ! blasphemer ! '' and shows off his notorious cleft chin , and the melting sequence , which goes on and on and on into the void , flanked with sounds of moaning and lots of writhing around . it could be a teeny bit redeemable if it were n't for the flat-out unbelievable final scene . oh , bloody hell .		2		0

scott calvin -lrb- tim allen -rrb- is a depressed divorced dad that resents his ex-wife laura -lrb- wendy crewson -rrb- marrying the child psychiatrist -lrb- judge reinhold -rrb- of his son charlie -lrb- eric lloyd -rrb- . after hearing a clatter on his roof , scott startles an intruder , santa claus , who falls to his accidental death . because of an unknown technical clause , he inherits the duties of santa . scott gains a massive amount of weight and rapidly grows a white beard and reluctantly transforms from a scrooge to santa claus . this all creates a problem for young charlie , because he knows his dad is santa ... but his step-father insists there is no santa claus . sitcom star allen makes his movie debut in this family friendly comedy . pretty corny , but assuredly the younger the viewer the more enjoyable the santa clause is . if you are not a tim allen fan this will fortify your opinion . also in the cast : david krumholtz , mary gross , peter boyle , joshua and larry brandenburg .		2		0
as an adult i ca n't stand to look at this movie anymore . i still like the famous theme song . it 's the best thing about this movie . the story is thin , but what could you expect from a movie based on a video game ? especially such a game as mortal kombat . it 's funny . the special effects that were amazing when i was a kid , now look incredibly cheap . the acting is bad , with the exception of christopher lambert -lrb- `` highlander '' -rrb- who seems to be having fun as rayden , so in the end he gives the best performance of movie . cary hiroyuki tagawa gives a rather annoying performance as the main villain . the whole movie is a terrible kitsch , because it 's too serious for it 's own good . the lame action scenes can ' save the movie . i also loved the `` subtle '' clues for liu kang how to defeat sub zero . jesus , i know that this movie was aimed at kids , but did the creators thought about retarded kids ?! anyway , it 's trash . i have yet to see a good movie based on computer game . i can agree that this is n't as bad as `` super mario bros '' . after all , they did make a sequel and tv series thanks to the success of this one . it does n't change the fact that adults should keep away from this movie . i give it 2/10 .		2		0
to be fair to dreamwork studio 's new film eurotrip , i felt uncomfortable even before the movie began . accustomed to arriving at movie theatres a full hour before show time , i was first shocked , then embarrassed when i saw a parade of young people -- some accompanied by adults , others in wolf packs -- arriving at my screening . i did n't know much about eurotrip other than what i read in the local papers , but i was pretty sure , i was about to sit though a film in the vein of old school or road trip , both films which pushed the envelope with what is now commonly phrased as ` gross-out comedy ' . so as i sat and watched these 7 to 14 year olds march into the room , it felt weird knowing that we were probably going to be subjected to copious amounts of nudity and a handful of jokes surrounding various taboo body parts . i had this vision of parents squirming in their seats wishing they had done their homework before agreeing on this films ' selection . eurotrip starts right after high school graduation and follows a group of three horny males and one female as they travel through europe with the goal of uniting one of the boys with his internet love . starting in england and taking the group through france , italy , amsterdam and eastern europe , the gang encounters every stereotype imaginable and characters so unlikable and unbelievable that you ca n't help but hope a ticket home for these teens comes sooner rather than later . how bad is the stereotyping you wonder . well , there 's the englishmen who are always looking for their next fight . there is the sexed up italian that makes his moves under the darkness of the train tunnels . throw in an annoying french mime , a dominatrix in amsterdam , and what europe trip would n't be complete without a visit to a nude beach . add all these together and you have the makings of this one skit at a time failure of a comedy . going in with absolutely no expectations , this movie had the chance to win me over . in fact , i actually chuckled during the opening credits and the cameo by matt damon as the singer who just stole someone 's girlfriend , was upbeat and promising . too bad they had to go to europe . now usually , reviews of films spend some time talking about the actors and the director and the work they have done previous . however , eurotrip boasts no recognizable faces -lrb- sure there 's lucy lawless and matt , but you would n't recognize them had the credits not identified -rrb- . i would offer a high reward to anyone that could name a film that features scott mechlowicz , jacob pitts or michelle trachtenberg . naming anything from first time director jeff schaffer would be even harder , but than again , any man who wrote the cat in the hat , might want to lay low for a while . this movie may play well with the younger crowd , but it is in no way comparable to old school or any of the american pie franchise . the situations the group finds themselves in seem stretched and it is no surprise that the writing team for this film is founded in television as it plays more like a r-rated madtv entry than it does something you want to fork over $ 13 bucks for . so now back to my opening statement . in the darkened theatre , i heard the constant laughter of pre-pubescent kids laughing at people being kicked in the groin , nude men running and flapping on the beach , someone being sodomized by a electric sexual device and the implied death of the pope . with each new scene of nudity -- and there is a lot -- or sexual reference , it felt like a knife digging into my side . i wondered about the rides home and whether the adults would take the opportunity to have open discussions with their children or if they would sweep the experience under the carpet . unfortunately for me , this instance made a bad film seem even worse .		2		0
bad , bad , bad acting and writing combine for a lousy thriller , which should be avoided , as watching paint dry would be a better option . alyssa milano is the only recognizable name among the horrible cast . mannequins have more emotion than these thespians who should be banned from ever working in front of a camera , for the rest of their lives . teddy graduates harvard medical school at the top of his class and is invited to join a pathology program . there he meets a group of fellow interns who get bored with dead bodies , and create a game to see who can commit the perfect murder . one by one , some innocent people are killed , and at least milano still looks good . other than her presence as ted 's girlfriend , there is nothing to save this mess .		2		0
this is director carter smith 's debut full length feature and that inexperience destroys this film minutes is the ideal running time for a horror , but in truth there is barely half an hour 's worth of material here . the premise of the story , the eponymous novel by scott smith is simple and fine . but carter smith is wholly unable to translate the layered horror of the page onto the screen . the ruins follows two american couples , just out of college , enjoying a pleasant , lazy beach holiday together in mexico as they go off with new found friends in search of some remote mayan ruins , site of a fabled archaeological the characters are underwritten , and the performances lack depth . frankly we do n't care whether they live or die . once stranded on the temple , a relatively small pyramid style structure , there quite literally is n't anywhere to go , and as this happens early on in the film this is a , horror gore quickly replaces plot in order to create any impact or basic horror principles that what you do n't see is more horrific than what you do see , as is the threat of what might come , are eschewed out of sheer desperation . the climax to the story is so clichéd all dramatic tension is lost and the final frame would have been thrown contemptuously aside by the tutor of a first year film studies photography and a fine setting do not compensate for a feature length failure .		2		0
it 's been a long time since i saw a dr. seuss book , much less read one , but i have vague memories of a slightly irreverent cat that ultimately does the right thing . this mess , on the other hand seemed to have few of the qualities i remembered as a kid . i do n't recall the cat spouting double-entendres and using crass humour in the books . so why here ? i can only conclude that the writer tried to `` update '' the cat to a more modern version . but i have to say all it succeded in doing was annoying me intensely . who was the film aimed at ? was it aimed at anyone ? will anyone find it entertaining ? all in all this was a mess of a film that should have been done by someone else , or left well enough alone altogether . i believe it got a razzie award as `` the worst excuse for an actual film '' . i suppose i should give a nod to the effort , since in this day and age all hollywood ever seems to do is remake old films . but try as i might , i ca n't get enthusiastic about this movie . it 's completely rubbish and , to give it the same treatment as the cat 's car . avoid this one if you have fond memories of dr seuss ' works . in fact , just avoid it . about the only good thing i have to say about it is that it 's not as bad as rocky and bullwinkle and did n't have big name stars making fools of themselves -lrb- apart from myers , whose star seems to be waning a little these days - and who can tell the baldwins apart , anyhow , so little harm done there -rrb- . give it a miss .		2		0
reeker shows us that not all independent horror films are great.i have to say that the only great thing about this movie are the first 3 after that great beginning , the movie is totally boring and the killer of the movie is really the first 3 minutes , this movie has almost no violence and it has a very slow did n't like the ending of the movie , really.i found the ending way movie shows us that , lamentably , not all independent horror movies are great.i do n't recommend this movie to you wan na see great independent horror films watch may or the is a shame in the history of horror movies .		2		0
mr. magorium 's wonder emporium -lrb- 2007 -rrb- * 1/2 dustin hoffman , natalie portman , jason bateman , zach mills , rebecca . hodgepodge of `` willy wonka '' but with toys about an ageless child enthusiast -lrb- hoffman in a fright wig and an ed wynn lisp -rrb- whose magical store is truly alive . however the direction by zach helm is stillborn and a real mess particularly wasting the genuine talents of portman as a wanna-be pianist who seems truly out of sorts throughout and bateman as an accounting mud . . the rating gets an extra 1/2 for the decent visuals but that can not be counterbalanced equally by the god awfulness of this kiddie aimed concoction .		2		0
i found it so hard to get into this . the premise is slightly interesting and felt like something hitchcock could have done wonders with , but when it came to the characters i just could n't have cared less . after about thirty minutes of trying and trying i realized that it was going to be this huge chore to get through the rest , and that 's what it was . robert mitchum was such a drag , a performance i was really looking forward to but could n't have been more flat to me . he was n't intimidating or interesting at all . the second we meet him you know exactly who he is and exactly what he 's going to be like . there was no sense of surprise or fear in the film at all . i did n't care about the kids and i was n't frightened by mitchum so the whole thing fell incredibly flat . there were some really nice images though , incredibly shot with great bits of symbolism throughout -lrb- in particular i liked the one shot when the kids were on the boat and we saw them through a spider web -rrb- . the whole thing really was n't working for me and then came the final act , which was just this disaster of out-of-character actions and dreadful attempts at comedy . it was this despicable fall of a bad film to a horrific one . all of this culminating in the ending that made me feel like i was about to get diabetes .		2		0
to begin , the plot of this thoroughly confusing film is so woolly and complicated i have no idea who killed whom or why . however the film serves a purpose : it 's symbolic and symptomatic of the decay of us society and of hollywood 's total lack of any moral code . every second word is f ** k or s ** t when there was no need for it . endless people are shot for no real reason . there is a constant diorama of nudity , violence and depravity in a society which disdains truth and honesty and where there no longer seem to be role models , standards and morals . it 's always about advantage and outsmarting the other guy . it is an unfortunate and ill-advised attempt at a murder comedy . it could have been a good one without the constant garbage mouthing , bed hopping , crotch and tit shots , violence and gun play . my problem is that the extensive number of perversions depicted here are portrayed as normal , routine and acceptable social behaviour . you make movies like this then decry the homocide rate and profess shock at the number of pregnant school kids . -lrb- is n't it odd that the imdb computer censored the f and s words which originally had been spelled out . yet they are in common use in just about every film listed here . -rrb-		2		0
this was among my least favorite movies , it really was . i was coaxed into watching it by a friend , the one positive i have for this movie is that abba is a wonderful band . other then that , sadly this is n't a movie that i really cared about . i did care about some of the characters , but have no interest in watching some people be tormented and some do nasty things to each other , which starts immediately into this movie , and at times , seems the major plot point of murial 's wedding . the movie was very depressing and it also moves at a snail 's pace . that really bothered me . most of the people i watch movies with feel the same with this one and yet so many people seem to like it . it 's hard to know why . not only was the story completely depressing but the movie dragged as not just in one area . the story movies remarkably slow and the whole movie seemed overlong and quite dull at times . i had a very difficult time with this movie although abba sure helped . it 's always nice to hear `` dancing queen '' .		2		0
omg ! i know now that dwayne johnson can no longer do action type films and he should stick to making films for disney . oh boy where do i start ? ok put it this way it was like you had me leaving jail and then going to kill all these guys who supposedly killed my brother and then its over you know nothing about me , am where i 've gone etc. etc. . this storyline was so full of pot holes its not funny . i do n't blame johnson or his acting as he usually does a pretty solid job its seems to be the fact that he needs help in script choosing or maybe its time he came back to where he belongs ... the wwe ! however that being said aside from the tooth fairy i have enjoyed his disney films . i am always willing it seems to give johnson another chance to kick ass and this of course will be coming up again soon in the new fast and the furious so hopefully that too is not a . this movie totally sucked the only thing it had going for it was the cool car that driver drove in it but it was n't cool enough to save this disaster of a film !		2		0
nothing grates quite so much as a `` realistic '' film that contains practically no realism at all . to its credit , `` all the real girls '' really * tries * to be true-to-life . but the dialog and performances do n't convince . characters in this film are constantly doing and saying quirky , bizarre things that real people never do or say . for example , in one of many strange `` romantic '' scenes , the female lead says to her boyfriend : `` i had a dream last night that you were growing a garden on a trampoline . and i was so happy that i invented peanut butter . '' so , what are we to make of this bizarre nugget of dialog ? is it `` sentimental '' ? is it `` deep '' ? and is it the kind of thing that i would say on a date ? -lrb- i 'll answer the last question for you -- `` no . '' -rrb- it 's none of those things , it 's just ridiculous ... the product of a strange , artificial mode of speech peculiar to american art-house movies . in another weird moment , our romantic leads are standing in an inexplicably deserted bowling alley -lrb- did they break in after hours ? -rrb- the guy says to his girlfriend something like , `` i wan na dance , but i do n't want you to watch me . turn around . '' so she turns around . and then he dances like a doofus . do even goofy teenagers behave like this on dates ? and am i really supposed to believe that this guy is a ladies ' man , as we are repeatedly told -lrb- but not actually shown -rrb- ? other exciting scenes involve a lengthy discussion of what 's better to eat for breakfast , pancakes or eggs ; a woman in a clown costume declaring something like `` i used to be beautiful , but now i am this clown '' ; and a scuffle in which an unimportant character gets beaten severely and choked , and is then totally forgotten about by all the other characters , the director , and the screenwriter . one of many strange lapses in a film of lapses . so , if your idea of a good time is to spend almost two hours in indie movie hell , watching a non-plot crawl along at the pace of a half-dead snail , while two superficial and thinly drawn characters alternate between flirting ridiculously and exchanging depressing anecdotes on their path to falling in a desperately superficial form of love ... well then , this may be the motion picture for you . i , for one , will be watching something like `` smiles of a summer night '' or `` terror of mechagodzilla '' instead .		2		0
i saw jaws 3-d -lrb- as it was called once upon a time -rrb- in the theatre back in 1983 . it was lousy then , and it 's even worse now on home video . it absolutely blows my mind to fathom that the classic science fiction author richard matheson was somehow involved in co-writing this exercise in extreme tedium . the so-called `` story '' is a failed attempt at changing the locale to an aquatic theme park called `` sea world '' where chief brody 's now-grown son michael works . rather conveniently , two sharks -lrb- mother and child ? -rrb- manage to gain access to the underwater kingdom to wreak havoc . sounds like it has potential ? forget it . the new shark scenes are sillier than ever , the level of tension and suspense is nil , and the characters are completely uninteresting . the worst served here is actor lou gossett jr. , who was so excellent in the previous year 's an officer and a gentleman . what a waste . dennis quaid plays mike without much to do , and while his love interest bess armstrong is cute in a girl-next-door sort of way , she leaves no impression either . the selling point of the film in 1983 was its 3-d effects , and these look absolutely pathetic on your 2-d home screen . a really , really bad and muddled movie and easily one of the very worst sequels to a classic motion picture ever made . this was followed by jaws : the revenge in 1987 , and as maligned as that film is by fans and critics , the truth is it turned out miles better than number three .		2		0
every now and then a film comes along that divides critics and the general public right down the middle . a critics ' choice might be a box office flop ; a sizable hit with the public can quite often be utterly despised by critics . `` drop dead fred '' seems to divide audiences into two camps in such a way . a glance through any movie guide will yield nothing but terrible write-ups and rock bottom star ratings -- -lrb- roger ebert even went as far as declaring , with great finality , that it was the worst film he 'd ever seen . -rrb- yet a glance through the user comments here on the imdb proves that the film has plenty of fans . courtroom secretary elizabeth cronin -lrb- phoebe cates -rrb- has the worst day of her life . in the course of one lunch hour , she breaks up with her philandering husband -lrb- tim matheson -rrb- , has her car stolen and is fired from her job . consequently , she has to move back into her childhood home with her over-bearing and domineering mother polly -lrb- marsha mason -rrb- . when elizabeth was a child she spent much of her time playing with a mischievous imaginary friend , drop dead fred -lrb- rik mayall -rrb- , and upon moving back home it is n't long before the now grown-up elizabeth starts `` seeing '' fred again . chaos ensues as elizabeth tries to piece her life back together with the help -lrb- or should that be hindrance -rrb- of drop dead fred . there 's nothing wrong with the basic concept of the film beyond its simplicity and childishness . the idea of a grown up being revisited by a troublesome imaginary friend from her childhood is fundamentally sound enough . but `` drop dead fred '' never builds on its potential - it is a thoroughly terrible film for a number of reasons . almost every attempt at humour revolves around infantile vulgarity . whether it 's wiping snot on other peoples ' faces , peeping up a woman 's skirt , or treading in dog poo , the level of humour in `` drop dead fred '' starts in the gutter and just gets lower . on the few occasions where anything resembling a fresh approach is adopted , the film settles for time-worn broad physical slapstick of the kind that the three stooges were offering fifty years previously . a cast of talented actors are thoroughly wasted in their respective roles . mayall shouts and jumps around a lot , substituting manic and wide-eyed mannerisms for restraint . matheson plays the unfaithful husband as a pure slimeball rather than a cunning cheat , making it extremely hard for the audience to believe that cates would ever really want him back . and cates herself fights a losing battle in a role that no actress could pull off -- her character is alternately gullible , stupid and improbable . `` drop dead fred '' is a poor film -- on this occasion i 'm afraid the critics got it right , and the film 's small , hardy band of fans have found something to admire here that the rest of us just ca n't fathom !		2		0
quite simply this blows . there is basically extremely violence w/out any sort of point . do n't get me wrong i can appreciate good violence when it has something to do w/the story . this just shows violence to show violence . there is absolutely no point to all of this violence . worse than that is the fact that there is n't any semblance of a comprehensible story either . there seems to be random characters popping up but for absolutely no reason ! the first half hour is an absolute waste of time . there are plot-holes -lrb- for whatever plot there is -rrb- that are hilariously bad also . what is most amazing is that somehow this garbage was released theatrically too ! skip this at all costs .		2		0
the abs or the drabs ... pick one bella . the problem is there is not enough story to go the distance . to stretch things out we get repetition and back story way late . we get a graduation speech that says bella is too young to make a career decision , but she wrestles with the forever decision . talk to dad . visit with mom and sit and talk . do a lot of walk and talk . be carried and talk . so much conversation , so quick epic battle . robert pattinson plays his role with all the emotion of a dead vampire . with the exception of ashley greene , the perky vampire , everyone is depressed . it 's no fun to be human , depressing to be a wolf and sucks to be a vampire . a total eclipse of a positive movie experience .		2		0
i 'll credit milla jovovich with an excellent performance within the framework of luc besson 's interpretation of the tale of joan of arc . besson borrows quite a little from other writers and directors in this film but his chief borrowing is from 20th and 21st century psychiatry . in the end , he tells viewers through joan 's visible conscience -lrb- portrayed by dustin hoffman -rrb- that her `` voices '' were the product of hysteria and that the messenger from god simply told her what she wanted to hear . to make this approach credible , besson introduces the murder and subsequent rape of joan 's elder sister , which she witnesses when she is 10 years old through cracks in the door to the closest where she is hiding . `` hysteria '' is a modern and plausible explanation for religious visions , but there is no historical evidence to serve as background -- and i found the modern day psycho-babble more than a little jarring , even though dustin hoffman does his best with the role . fay dunaway also performs very effectively but john malkovich is john malkovich , not the dauphin . despite acting that is generally good , i found this to be the least satisfying version of the joan of arc story that i have ever seen , and i 've seen most of them at one time or another .		2		0
after killing a cop and maiming others , a drug-addicted nut case is inexplicably trained to work as an assassin for the police . nothing about this idiotic movie makes sense . why is n't a cop killer punished ? why do the police pick such an unstable person to work for them ? why are the police in the assassination business ? parillaud turns in a surly performance in the title role , a character about as interesting as a wet rag . she veers from cold-blooded killer to whiny cry-baby to giggling schoolgirl , but no attempt is made to explain her bizarre behavior . nikita 's missions are executed so poorly that they are laughable . there 's a dull romance with a grocery store cashier .		2		0
any movie that starts at creation and goes into the fifties and beyond is going to be too long . five editors are given credit , five were n't enough . these days everyone receives great photo images via the internet . it does n't take two plus hours to enjoy them . a good cast does n't have much to say as there is very little dialogue . at one point the eldest son has the opportunity to kill his father and you wish he did . he wishes his father dead , you wish the movie would be over . no one seems to be able to escape the abuse , except for the audience members who left early . do n't get sucked in . looks good , but it is bad .		2		0
i like most of the fast & furious stuff , to varying degrees , largely because of some expert mechanics in the camera . tokyo drift boasts the most intriguingly colorful world , but the execution is much too ordinary , pulling back from much the same sexuality and intrinsic deathwish linked to mechanical beasts that cronenberg had shown in crash . once vin diesel came back on board , the stories ` matured ' to just generic crime stuff , losing the youthful world , but the mechanical execution improved . this is poor in the usual , expected ways , it is intended for a teenage audience so the dynamics reflect a teenage understanding of how things work . you 'll see that in just the opening race , where no one is older than 25 , the race takes place through empty streets , with no actual life anywhere . miraculously how , kids have bust into the control room of a lifting bridge which they lift to spice up the race , just like that . and in the end the show up , breaking off the party . in the end , who cares about a stupid plot with a drug kingpin ? i 'd love , seriously love , to see a film like this that just revels in the hyper world of mindless chrome , girls , music and engine roar , a gummo or spring breakers . something that truly felt illegal and dangerous . tokyo drift came close , but again no . but what really kills this is how devastatingly poor is the racing action . it would vastly improve in the next one , and over time , as the special effects , editing and production design teams would gradually change , especially from the fourth movie onwards . but here singleton and his team embarrass themselves . the motion detail , backgrounds , impacts , and virtual camera in the driving are on a power rangers level . nearly all of them were replaced for tokyo drift . this is the batman and robin of the franchise , just lame from start to finish , and coming so early it 's a miracle it did n't kill it off .		2		0
incredibly bad , brooding piece with an older man , dissatisfied with life , who is turned into rock hudson by an organization that gets its business from word of mouth . trouble is that the grass is n't always necessarily greener on the other side of the track . at age 40 , hudson looks more like 50 , as he attempts the malibu life with a swinging party . trouble is that he gets too drunk and you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to discover who those guys are who are trying to restrain him . obviously , the company has failed in attempting to recreate hudson . there is only one alternative and a priest , rabbi , minister , all in one , says the words as hudson is led down the halls . this is a colossal bomb by director john frankenheimer . what was anyone thinking when they made this awful film ? life is n't a bowl of cherries , but stay with what you have .		2		0
spoilers : since this movie has a high -lrb- or low ?!? -rrb- position in the bottom 100 i just had to see it with my own only because of the rating but also since a lot of movies that are judged in a bad way are not that bad , for instance `` plan 9 from outer space '' by ed wood which is seen as the worst movie ever based on several really enjoyed that movie.but this time i could n't agree more with the imdb voters : `` earth '' sucks ! first of all there is the truly chaotic and completely ridiculous story , the movie just does n't make any sense.it goes from here to there and nothing is acting does n't compensate , john travolta seems to be back in his `` look who 's talking '' streak of bad acting is so not good , he extremely over-acting and in this kind of movie that is a bad he is casted as the star of the movie his role of the bad guy is a supporting one -lrb- just like marlon brando in `` apocalypse now '' -rrb- . the hero and the leading character is jonnie , played by barry pepper who 's best known for his role as the sniper in `` saving private ryan '' but he just is n't convincing either.the other acting is also inferior and that 's a shame since one of my favorite actors is playing this film : forest problem though is that he chooses a lot of bad roles in his career -lrb- such a shame -rrb- but his good movies are truly great and his acting in those is even better = > i mention `` smoke '' and especially `` ghost dog '' by jim jarmusch . the special effects are nothing special either , it looks more like a video game at times . there are a lot of mysteries in the movie that are totally unexplainable , for instance : why are the aliens on planet earth when they hate it so because of the gold ! why are the aliens talking in this mystery language at one moment and another moment talking english to each other , so on and so forth . the climax is very anti and the closing shot is a direct rip off from `` raiders of the lost ark '' . as the whole movie is copied from classic sci-fi movies like `` star wars '' , `` blade runner '' and especially `` planet of the apes '' . john travolta and his alien gang are in their way of thinking just like the apes in the charlton heston classic . all in all , a shameless effort to revive science just does n't make sense for one moment . 2/10		2		0
i watched this ... no , i endured this movie , a few days after seeing ` the others ' . and i think i probably managed to cop one of the best haunted house movies of all time , followed by one of the worst . why one of the worst ? there are , after all , dozens of awful haunted house movies stretching back for decades . which is the point : king ought to have known the traps and cliches not to slip into , but he did n't just slip into them , he sought them out and made them centerpieces of the movie . the cast is almost uniformly bland , the script woefully predictable , and the thing moves at such a crawl ... i swear to god that in the first 60 minutes _ nothing happens at all , _ and after that we 're treated to wonderful five or ten minute sequences of pointless camera shots of parts of the house with people whispering in the background . ! we even have the inevitable psychic , weird child , and the negro servant -lrb- straight out of the shining -rrb- . the only thing missing is the recovering writer . now do n't get me wrong : i like stephen king 's books . i also think that at least four of his stories have been made into good movies , and three of them are classics -lrb- stand by me , the green mile , and the shawshank redemption -lrb- the last of which is ranked # 2 movie of all time on this very database -rrb- . significantly , none of these are horror films . so what goes wrong when king himself gets involved in the production ? everything seems to go to hell . and this is probably the worst thing he 's been involved with since the awful ` maximum overdrive ' . only thing i can suggest is , watch this , and then reward yourself with ` the others ' a few nights later . 2/10		2		0

role models , sort of a second grade apatow or mckay production , is distressing from end to end . the premise augured a good dose of humour though , but it is the complete opposite that occurred and one realizes really quickly the intergalactic void that is this movie . the dialogues are of a rarely achieved dreadfulness , and the scenes are for the most part really bad , badly filmed , badly edited , and flow together in a total disinterest , not to mention the cliché psychology and moral . almost all the gags fall flat and ca n't manage to raise the already abyssal level of a script that goes nowhere . william scott and rudd also weigh down the movie , not helped by their bland and uninteresting characters . jane lynch is the only one to stand out a bit in a completely crazy style that suits her wonderfully .		2		0
not entirely sure what happened to the whole generation of horror directors , who once formed the whole genre and are held in high regard for their work in the 1970s and 1980s . this includes such renowned names like brian de palma , tobe hooper , john carpenter , george romero or dario argento . now wes craven has joined the cast of former greats basking in their past glory . `` my soul to take '' ventures into well-tread paths of the genre , but with absolute lack of flair and some dreadful performances to boot . attempting to rekindle the atmosphere of horror serial killers wes craven breaks into a script with absolutely no redeeming qualities , additionally inhibited by senselessly laughable dialogue and character formation , which fails to go anywhere . what is arguably the only decent scene , `` my soul to take '' starts off with the grim realisation by a happy married man , that he is in fact a schizophrenic with a murderous second personality as a serial killer . upon this gruesome revelation an inner struggles results with him murdering his pregnant wife , meeting his demise after a succession of miraculous awakenings after being repeatedly shot . years later on the 16th anniversary -lrb- do n't ask me what made that year so special ... -rrb- the town of riverton lives by the legend and seven children born on that fateful day annually cast away the demon from returning . when the seven start dying one after another questions reappear as to whether the killer survived that day or maybe he has been reincarnated in one of the seven . bug -lrb- max thieriot -rrb- , a boy with a dark past , is soon to become the prime suspect ... being somewhat lenient the repetitive premise could have at least met the standard norms and been given a passing grade . however craven fails to keep up with the horror standards he helped creates , instead only coping with throwing in multiple clichés . as such the execution is horrendous , especially with the audacious acting gasping to die with a glimmer of sensibility and coherence . mind-boggling pointless fare not to be recommended to anyone who wants to keep a positive outlook on craven 's legacy should do best to pass on this failed creation .		2		0
i ca n't say enough how goofy travolta 's character was . the saturday night fever man failed to deliver any goods whatsoever . i mean , come on ! he was an angel ? i do n't care how many ways you slice it , he was no angel ! he was a stoned version of what he thought should have been an angel . i did n't like any aspects of this movie . i kept thinking that john would eventually say something intelligent and not like he was in the middle of being stoned . did you notice how he talked like a stoner ? also , the beautiful andie mcdowell was miscast as the partner of william hurt . it hurt me to watch the banter between those two . i admit , it was commendable for andie to keep the texas accent but that was about it . there was nothing mystical about this movie . it was simply something that a stoner would enjoy because from a stoner 's perspective , john travolta would have been quite entertaining . sorry john , but you lost me on this one . two thumbs down .		2		0
the story is no better than an episode of `` ghost whisperer '' except there is an a list cast . did n't they read the story before producing the movie ? it is a ludicrous story and does n't have a cleverly written script . `` the sixth sense '' was clever and clicked . there is no click here . one small saving grace , in it 's own way the story is conclusive and things are explained . the acting is alright . what a waste of a top notch cast . daniel craig is alright as the main character . naomi watts is good as the sympathetic neighbour . rachel weisz struggles with her accent a bit and sounds strange . overall watch it if you are a fan of the main stars but be prepared for a bad story .		2		0
dull , dull , dull . three hours of dreary dialog and often boring musical numbers . some of the musical numbers are actually ten times better than the dialogue bits - that says it all . the first half is particularly dull . too silly and absurd to be a credible bio -lrb- artistic license has been stretched here -rrb- , and too unfunny to be a comedy . there is n't a single scene that could be considered funny nowadays -lrb- and maybe even back then , too -rrb- . powell lacks charisma , and certainly is n't someone who can carry a movie of this `` size '' . accepting him as a womanizer is difficult ; i do n't know what the actual ziegfeld looked like , but powell could n't charm an alley dog with that face of his . he 's got ta be the ugliest leading man of that era . rainer is totally over-the-top and too animated ; her one-note acting gets tedious very quickly . only myrna loy shows charm and screen presence , but it 's a good two hours before she even appears so she is in no position to save the movie . the film got a couple of oscars . yes , it 's one of those ...		2		0
a fall from greatness is a sad thing to witness , and none is sadder than the fall witnessed in `` beverly hills cop ii '' . eddie murphy is back as axel foley and you can have him . he 's back in beverly hills to find the truth behind the shooting of capt. bogomil -lrb- ronny cox -rrb- . this consists of him insulting and belittling nearly every single person who comes across his field of vision in a loud , shrill and usually un-funny way . even . taggart -lrb- ashton -rrb- and rosewood -lrb- reinhold -rrb- do n't get away unscathed , even as they work with axel once more . of course , the biggest joke in this movie is eddie himself ; he is so full of himself here and believes , even when he is being a jerk , he 's in the right . it 's amazing : in this single film alone , he takes bland pot shots at blue collar workers , receptionists , tall blonde women -lrb- nielsen -rrb- , german-accented bad guys -lrb- prochnow -rrb- , overbearing cops -lrb- garfield , hill , reiser -rrb- weaselly little front men -lrb- stockwell , looking suspiciously like his dr. yueh character from 1984 's `` dune '' -rrb- , gerald ford and hugh hefner ! things are made worse when you realize that no one could ever get away with the things murphy does here . only in his little world he has created for himself . nobody does themselves any favors by appearing in this movie . and the cameos by people with talent -lrb- reiser , chris rock , gilbert gottfried -rrb- are so short that you expect murphy felt himself being and cut them himself . hey , it could happen . and there is so much misogyny running through this flick that you expect gloria steinem could use this whole film as an indictment against hollywood in general . and win . what a waste . the only good scene is the obviously improvised scene where murphy introduces himself as johnny wishbone from the island of st. croix . and that 's about it . not much for action fans here , either . two stars . one for the good will left over from the original and the fact that sylvester stallone , original choice for axel foley , did n't take this role . just imagine what he would have done to `` beverly hills cop ii '' . of course , you could always watch `` cobra '' ...		2		0
i caught this on , a station that often shows vintage films . the film was so jingoistic i though it must have been made during wwii . i about to write to the station about selecting such a silly preposterously biased film in these days , that depicts the american as god-like creatures slaying the reptilians jap hordes . at times it is as turgid as charleton heston in the ten commandments . when i looked it up , to my astonishment , i discovered it was made in 2005 . yet it smells as silly and overdone as those woody woodpecker or popeye wwii propaganda films . i take it this film was created as a propaganda piece to sell the afghan and iraq wars , by harking back to ww ii glory . the musical score is like something out of the 50s with soaring strings and dramatic crescendos , very melodramatic . the film quality is fuzzy too with bad colour , again like a film from ww ii . perhaps that was deliberate to make the film appear to be made in that era . in summary this film has no value other than as propaganda .		2		0
in order to express my impressions of domino , the film , i will need to resort to a certain four letter word that describes what two people generally get up to when they are feeling especially amorous . since the programmers at the imdb will not allow me to do this , i am going to substitute the word penguin . so for the duration of the review , when i make use of the word penguin , i am really referring to something that , under the best circumstances , is known to be incredibly pleasant , satisfying , even enthralling . quite the opposite of how the film turned out , in other words . anyway , i should pretend to be surprised that the director admitting to having shot a frame of this mess is tony scott , the same man who gave us such drivel as top gun and days of thunder , those veritable extensions to the already out of control ego belonging to tom cruise . but when you get past the grating camera-work , the oppressive music , and the wooden acting , what you are left with is essentially a two-hour music video . the acting is the most obviously misguided element of the film . when she is cast well , keira knightley can keep the viewer captivated with a performance that is by equal turns bitchy and endearing . unfortunately , the role of domino harvey goes so far beyond her grasp that one could be forgiven for thinking this was her debut performance , not the latest entry in a career spanning twelve years . adding to the problem is that knightley is meant to be the titular character . the focus is meant to entirely be upon her . that she is acted right out of frame by the two men she shares most of her screen time with is a massive failing for the film . granted , there are few actors who can share the frame with mickey rourke and not be totally overwhelmed by him , but given the threadbare script and poor direction , it is hard to give knightley sole ownership of the blame . a complaint i often use with films like these is that we know nothing about the characters at the beginning , and even less by the end . never has such a complaint fit the bill so well . not helping matters is the indecision regarding whether to harvey 's life or make a literal biography . the addition of a ridiculous subplot with a reality show featuring ian ziering and brian austin green following harvey and her cohorts on business trips swings the film so far into the realm of fiction it almost becomes embarrassing . after their performances in another series i will not glorify by mentioning here , i never expected to feel sympathy for those two , but bad film-making can do some strange things . then the film tries to share details of harvey 's life in order to explain why she hunts people down for a living in the film 's present time . in simpler language , domino the film tries to have it both ways with domino the real human being , and ends up failing at both . balancing the need of the film to intrigue the viewer using sordid details with the need to avoid lawsuits could not have been easy , and domino is elegant proof that such juggling should not be attempted by a director as mediocre as tony scott . there is a saying among architects that applies , albeit in different wording , to storytelling . the most ornate window fixings , columns , and doors will not help you if your foundations are shoddy . in domino , scott takes this a step further , and quite apparently does not even bother trying to construct foundations at all . sure , the sequences of domino giving her marks a lapdance or firing guns capture the immediate attention , even if the former raises the question of what bounty hunter in their right mind would do that . the problem is that once the initial fascination birthed in violence fades , the complete and utter lack of substance in the story shines through for all to see . keith phipps asks the question of whether tony scott was trying to make a film for chimpanzees , but this is insulting both to humans and chimpanzees . since the two creatures are only different by a handful of percentage points at the dna level , it is not hard to imagine a chimpanzee seeing this and thinking it was a complete and utter . you have also read that tony scott cast a mob of has-beens and icons from trash tv . in the hands of a competent director such as alex cox or jay chandrasekhar , this would result in an absurd comedy of extreme situations . one where the barrier between reality and low-grade hallucination becomes questionable , or even non-existent . tony scott is utterly incapable of blurring the distinction . consequently , instead of making a comedy of unreality , he creates a string of pictures and noises that give the discerning viewer a headache as they frequently fail to make sense . the result is a film that possesses none of even the unintentional amusing qualities present in top gun or days of thunder . thus , scott violates the one absolutely rule of film-making . you can make a good film , you can make a bad film , but heaven 's chorus of angels will not help you if you make a completely and utterly boring film . during my viewing of domino , i found the list of ingredients used in making the dark silver paint i use in order to colour the armour on some of my models more fascinating . hence , i gave domino a two out of ten . money can be replaced , as can display units or snack food . but take this as a warning : you will never get the two hours back .		2		0
i saw this movie for the first time when i was still a pre-teen , because one of the girls i knew from school -lrb- an older teenager -rrb- was obsessed with it . i did n't get it back then . i saw this movie again in my late teens , and did n't get it then , either . watched it again the other day , and i still do n't get it ! i do n't understand what all the fuss is about . it 's unremarkable , boring , predictable , monotonous , and thoroughly mediocre . as if that was n't enough , it also manages to be offensive to boot . the plot was disgustingly predictable and uninspiring ; the dialogue - horrendous . there was zero chemistry between the lead actors . in fact , it was quite apparent that they ca n't stand each other . speaking of characters , - they were all highly unlikeable . johnny = obnoxious , arrogant , self-absorbed , one-dimensional a *** hole . baby = obnoxious , arrogant , self-absorbed , one-dimensional slag . and it 's actually quite disgusting that patrick swayze , who seems to be in his mid-30s , is sleeping with a girl 15-20 years his junior . granted , she was a slapper , but was this movie made to glamorize child molesters or underage hookers ? do n't get me wrong , i did like `` lolita '' -lrb- where the same was happening , but it 's expected , and actually quite tastefully done -rrb- , but this ... was just creepy and disturbing . it 's just my opinion , but i think one must be slightly retarded to refer to this utter disgrace as a `` masterpiece '' .		2		0
