i have only been here once , but sadly will not be returning again . on a lighter note , i actually thought the restaurant itself was pretty cool and i also even liked the food . both the shepherd 's pie and the corned beef were quite good ! so why wo n't i come back here ? one of the staff was extremely rude to one of my friends and made her feel completely unwelcome . it was especially bad , because he was a manager . she brought a problem to him and he basically told her he did n't care and did n't need her business . i did n't catch all of what went on myself , because it was a loud place with music playing , but a big thing for me is the way that the management treats their customers . we ended up leaving earlier than we had planned , because my friend got offended by the manager , so this is not a place i will be returning to . i would not recommend this place to anybody if feeling valued as a customer is important to you .		1		0
i ate at the original barrio cafe on 16th which was very good and interesting -lrb- maybe a little overpriced -rrb- but definetly recommended . the airport barrio cafe was like the owner lost control of the car and drove off the road that has taken them to success . i ordered a burrito -lrb- do n't remember which -rrb- but it was soggy , with what tasted like canned chicken and a ton of sour cream . nasty !!		1		0
11/11/10 was in the area for a november oye that was about to start in 30 minutes , but i was so hungry and did n't really think my second meal-of-the-day comprised of pie , cake , pastries , and wine was a healthy way to end the evening w / , so i decided i 'd check out red devil . it was dead inside -lrb- only a couple was there for dinner -rrb- , and i got the feeling that most of the business that evening was going to be take-outs . bartender was friendly enough , until i started asking questions about the ingredients . he still remained accessible , but the smiles certainly went away . i almost stood up and left . when the food arrived 25 minutes later , i wished i had left ! i found the calzone crust soggy - no crispiness anywhere , and the mozzarella-ricotta mix made for an ugly , bland-tasting -lrb- i detected no ricotta flavor at all -rrb- conglomeration . -lrb- see photos . -rrb- the only thing that turned out ok was the marinara sauce , but what good is it if the item you 're supposed to eat it w / is n't worth the trouble ? i had the leftovers boxed , and stood up to go after only spending 5 minutes eating . after all , i had a party to attend ! p.s. . what a poor example of a treehugger i am ! no sooner had i exited rd 's doors did i take the first chance to throw the leftovers in the trash . should 've just left it on the table ...		1		0
we ca n't stop here ... this is cougar country ! seriously , this is such a cougar 's den . not just that , but this place has the biggest infestation of douche bags . you need a gas mask just to cut through the axe , bronzer , and fumes of hair gel that linger throughout the air . if you want a visual of what this place looks like on the weekend , take a gander at : www.hotchickswithdouchebags.com . click it . it 's a real site and it 's what this place and its patrons looks like . if you model your style of dress and behavior after vh1 reality shows , drop in for a swig and some high-fives from your fellow date rapists . if not , just pray in thanks that scottsdale is where it 's at and everything you love is where it is . there 's a live band that plays and i 'm not a fan , mainly because it 's not my type of music . they play alot of butt rock and the like ... basically stuff you 'd expect a cruise ship band to have jam sessions to in about 20 years . the only reason i 'm giving this place 1 star as opposed to none -lrb- if that were an option -rrb- is that the staff is pretty good . they tend to see that everything is going good and do a good job of bringing what you 've ordered on time . lastly , i feel bad for alot of the waitresses . how they put up with a crowd that takes pointers from episodes of rock of love and tool academy , i will never know .		1		0

what 's the point of the red robin cards if when you walk in the waiters get to decide that they 're `` expired '' ? note : there is n't an expiration date anywhere on the cards . we refused service and left . it was a gift card from my mom by the way .		1		0
this review is about 2 months late , but just knowing that i kept this place in mind means something . so , let me start by saying `` this place is horrible '' . a group of friends and i went here before the arizona/asu basketball game . now , knowing that the 2 schools are rivals , you would think that it would be a big turn out . well , it was . apparently , the tavern did n't bother staffing for it . the place was packed . there were only a handful of servers . our server was in no hurry to help us . our friend waited over an hour for his food and he only got his food after telling the bartender . also , many drinks were dying while they sat at the bar , so we just walked up and grabbed ours . when we asked for the check , it took her at least 20 minutes to drop it off and it was all wrong . there was another tables food and drink on it . we told our server and she `` corrected it '' . except , she did n't . it was still wrong . so , we did it ourselves and left her the exact amount of what we owed . i 'm a server myself , so i know how things go . worst place ever .		1		0
just got back from having lunch here ... been many times in the last year for lunch , take out , ect . we will not be back !!! went for lunch ... got my usual of kung pao tofu with white rice and veggie egg roll . my husband ordered 2 pc . tuna nigiri , 2 pc . salmon nigiri , 2 pc . yellowtail nigiri . the reason he ordered this is because walking in there was a big dry erase board above the sushi chef and it said , `` daily special nigiri 99 cent / 1 pc . yellowtail $ 1.50 / 1 pc . '' when we ordered we specified that he was getting the daily special and how many of each kind . when we got the bill he was charged $ 16 for 6 pc of sushi when it should have been $ 7 . when i pointed out the mistake i was told that the white board special is happy hour specials . i pointed out that no where on the white board did it specify that there was a time that the specials were good for . i also pointed out that it was specified at the time of order that we were getting the daily special and pointed with my finger to the white board . the woman still charged us the $ 16 . she got a $ 0 tip . well sun asian , you just lost a big local customer . you will never see us again .		1		0
really lgo ?! i quit going to my neighborhood spot because of all the `` affliction wearing douche 's '' that have over run every area of my neighborhood . a friend invited yesterday for lunch , so we jammed on our cruisers . . well , you know the parking and it was a beautiful day yesterday . i was so craving the tuna melt sandwich have been salivating about it for months . . months i tell you . i order from a chipper little gal ... i asked if i could have it open faced . she did n't think it would be a problem ... wrong answer ! the kitchen obviously has never made an open faced before . . oh yes they have and use to get it right . . guess the new peeps from down south did n't get the how to memo . the 1st time it came out with two slices of bread with a square of slightly melted cheddar laying there flat with a huge dollop of cold tuna on top ... really ?? i took it back . . a different girl said what 's wrong with that ? apparently everything you nit wit ! so , they remade it , check my photo . . this is what i got back . . except i added the zig zag of color just so i could choke it down . the `` manager type '' person actually handed this to me and said , `` your remake '' really ? but i was so hungry and frustrated , i took it . . not even any fruit . . so for $ 7.50 i got a plate of tuna poop . 3 bites later , it hit the trash receptacle . do n't ever expect anyone there to step up to the plate and offer you a refund or a do over . . cuz it just ai n't happening right . i was here a couple of months ago , ordered potato leek soup , came out curdled and cold . . an employee walking by my table said , `` wow that does n't look right , gross '' would n't take it off the bill and was like , `` glad i 'm not eating it '' . and i 'm glad i 'm not eating here anymore and that bertha 's and acacia cafe have moved into the neighborhood . the people watching may not be the same , but the food is great , service outstanding and even better prices . what a shame !		1		0
i sadly have to downgrade my review ... i do n't know what 's happening here , because this was such a great little place with a super friendly owner , but lately service and food are not reaching par . just the other day we ordered delivery , about 12 arepas for 6 of us . the order took almost two hours to deliver , we called 4 times asking what was up -lrb- our house is litterally walking distance from my arepa , we should have just picked it up , but when you pay extra to have something delivered , it 's because you ca n't pick it up , right ?? -rrb- when it finally came , there was no apology or discount for the inconvience ... the worse part was that part of the order was wrong ! i ordered two `` queen of queens '' arepas -lrb- their specialty -rrb- , which is just chicken and avocado , however mine came without the avocado ! and about a tablespoon worth of chicken ; / come on ! how do you forget one of the main ingredeints ? of a total of three ingredeints ?? we also had ordered extra sauce -lrb- which , the green sauce is what makes the arepa -rrb- , so of course , there was none in our order ... i was so mad , i decided to just go over and get some myself -lrb- as i said , i live accross the street -rrb- when i asked for 5 containers , the cook brought me 3 . i asked for two more . o_0 and instead of giving me new arepas -lrb- remember , i was missing the avocado -rrb- the cook spent a whole extra 10 minutes slicing some avocado and putting it in a to-go box to add to my now cold arepas . -lrb- and by the way , there was a total of one customer in the restaurant when this took place -rrb- not very happy at this point . and to add to it , i find out later that one of the girls in our party ended up with a stomache ache that night ... having a delivery order driving around with chicken and mayo products for two hours is bound to make someone sick ... . and it did . : / i hope things change , because i really used to like this place ...		1		0
i use to go here once or twice a week when it was a hole-in-wall pizza joint and the owner worked there everyday . really good pie and service . it had a perfect pizza joint atmosphere too . then they got really popular , expanded , hired more help , churched the the place up and raised the prices . i stopped going when i had two back to back experiences with bad food and bad service . the last time i went there was for a large pie and my bill was $ 40 . now ? costco 's pizza is better and a whole lot less expensive .		1		0
as far as the quality of the finished product goes , i 'd give it three stars . nothing great , nothing terrible . my shirts were done up . my suit was lookin ' fly . i dress nice . the thing that really chaps my ass about this place though is the customer service . the people that work here have to be the most arrogant , angry , miserable individuals i have ever met . yes , i get it . you have a job that probably sucks , but guess what ? everyone 's job sucks to some degree . try working in a call center where you work with 300 people and you are whipped with chains . i know people who do this . they have it worse off than you . you work at the cleaners . all you have to do is take clothes , put tags on them and put them away . to the management of seville ... teach your employees some manners . maybe you will earn more business . sadly ... it wo n't be mine .		1		0

i have dined at wcg before and attempted to make plans for my group of friends and i to celebrate a birthday there . unfortunately , wcg does not accomodate parties greater than 4 . you will have to wait until tables become available as they will not even take a reservation for anything greater than party of 4 . no , this is n't advertised on their website . seriously ... and in this economy ? really ? keep this in mind as you all are preparing for your holiday celebrations and go somewhere where your business is appreciated . i sent them a copy of the receipt from our party of 9 's dinner elsewhere to the corporate offices to let them know what they missed out on . i doubt they will care as jillian , the hostess who answered the phone when i called about our reservation was completely unfettered to lose our business . absurd .		1		0
you know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them ? this of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium . well the tortilla factory must have the same listening skills ... their management never listens either . you would think that after 111 reviews , someone over there would recognize there 's a problem with the service . nope . this would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about yelp , or , and i suspect this is more the case , they ca n't read , prior to writing this , i read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up . uncannily , it was true to form , explaining why this place gets two and a half stars . service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks . had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them . . appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas . hey tf , do i need to remind you of your namesake ??? and the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you . -lrb- i sampled everyone 's food in our party of eight -rrb- old town tortilla factory ... you 're really one sneaky bastard . laying in wait ... for all the unsuspecting scottsdale visitors looking for the ` mexican food ' experience , and instead ambushing them with your bad service , high prices and tasteless garbage you call food . but you do have some nice attributes , which is why , similar to my situation of never listening , i still have a wife . only i 'm not sure how a fountain , large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business . oh well , who cares ... right ? there 'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow . are you related to rustlers roost by any chance ? you both have so much in common .		1		0
we 're so done with this place . years ago gordon 's was such a great place to go for lunch when there was a fun festival on mill ave , or for dinner when you and your friends were going out for some fun . now gordon 's is a place full of constant disappointments . a couple months ago we went to the gordon 's in san tan village and we were served cold , tasteless food . a month later we decided to give them another try and it happened again . this time i wrote to gordon 's telling them of our unsatisfactory visits , and they were very courteous and mailed us gift cards while encouraging us to give them another try . today we visited the mill ave location and regardless that the food was free because of the gift cards i wished we had n't gone . we sat in the self seating area near the bar . our server was very standoffish and you could tell he did n't want to be there at all . he brought us our soda 's and took our order but he did n't bother to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked , nor did he ask which option we wanted for our sides . while waiting for our food i noticed both of our glasses were dirty and had old food remnants in them !! i grabbed another server who was walking by and told her . she apologized and took the glasses . a few minutes later she brought our new sodas over and said , `` well we serve lemons and strawberries in our glasses from the lemonades but they were sterilized so the food pieces in them were clean so it 's okay . '' are you effing kidding me !? finally the food came and just like the san tan village location the food was cold , and absolutely tasteless . we finished our meal gave the gift cards to the server and left . seriously , if you 're looking for a fabulous burger , great beer , excellent service and an a fun atmosphere please try san tan brewery which is in chandler off of arizona ave and chandler blvd in the old town area . you wo n't be disappointed ! as my dad would say , they could sell their burgers in india they 're so good . http://www.santanbrewing.com or if you 're near tempe and okay with fighting for parking try four peak 's brewery , they 're also fantastic . http://www.fourpeaks.com/		1		0

i stopped here after lunch for some baklava ... . . well ... ... that was by far the worst baklava i 've ever eaten . i was so disappointed , after reading the reviews i was expecting something that would knock my socks off . i ordered 1 piece of walnut and 1 piece of pistachio . they looked perfect -lrb- see pics -rrb- boy are looks deceiving , i bit into soaking sticky wet goosh , it was so soggy and stale at the same time , i literally spit it out along with the next bite of the pistachio piece , both not worthy of swallowing , it was that bad ! i guess i 'm spoiled , nobody makes baklava better than my mom or my gramps , i need to make a trip home . 1 star for their baklava , i 'll have to go back to rate the food , maybe .		1		0

when thinking of irish pubs , i know we all have the same image in our head ... a bunch of popped collar , frat boy douchebags trying to out cool each other and find the stupidest , skinniest girl in the room right ? no , really , you see misty green hills , friendly barkeeps , and a nice , welcoming crowd ? apparently the people running rula bula have either never been to ireland , or come from county jerkface ... because this pub is about as irish as ceaser chavez . where is the friendly atmosphere ? actually where is any atmosphere ? where is the friendly service ? where is the tasty irish fare ? actually , rula bula is great - every once in a while , i just simply feel too good about myself . i get too confident and comfortable , and i really need to be bitch-slapped back to reality . when this happens , a quick trip to mill and a visit to this pub can make anyone feel terrible . such a waste of awesome real estate , and yeah , the little signs and kitchy stuff they have is cute . but irish pub , you are kidding me . rula bula you can póg mo thóin !		1		0
this used to be on my very short list of `` favorite '' restaurants . everything was perfect - except the pad thai -lrb- i am a traditionalist when it comes to pad thai and it 's not realy pad thai at fate , the noodles and the sauce are wholly different -rrb- . the crab puffs were amazing , the ambiance was clever and appropriately aloof/warm . i even enjoyed the loud music next door , the bar was comfortable - and the scene was young and nutty . , loved it . i am sad to see this place die out . i have not visited fate since sens opened up - i was hoping sens and fate would do some joint marketing and certainly there was enough interest for them to work as a team - but alas , fate moved on without jonny and that was a huge mistake . see my review of sens. that place just keeps getting better and better . i am addicted . we go very often and enjoy everything about the people and the food .		1		0
i hate to give any pita jungle 1 star , i loooooooooove pita jungle ! but this place deserves it . i went here last saturday with my sister and a friend . our waitress was quick to take our drink order . at that time we placed an order for some hummus to snack on while we waited as they were super busy . our drinks were delivered , but no hummus ... we figure it will be out any moment ... 10 minutes go by and some other person comes to our table with our lunch order sans hummus ... the waitress shows up and we ask if we could still have the hummus we ordered , she acted as if we just asked her to do something out side of her job description . then my sister and i dig into our food , we both ordered the same exact thing and we both asked for chicken in our salads , neither of our salads had chicken . when we brought this to our waitresses attention she got all mad and huffed and puffed and we just told her to make sure we did n't get charged for the chicken as we did n't receive it . she really sucked . every time she came to our table she acted like a big bitch . the waitress that was waiting on the section next to us was dressed in an outfit that was so ridiculous . tank top , cowboy boots and shorts that were so short you could seriously almost see her lady parts . this is not an over exaggeration , i do n't even own bathing suits that short . this chick could have hit up the beach for a tan and not gotten any tan lines , that 's how short these shorts were . she was barley covered and i was thankful she was not our waitress as i did n't want any rouge hairs in my meal . i can not believe that the pj allows their wait staff to dress however they want with out any set reasonable guidelines . the food was awesome , the experience ... not so much .		1		0
green peppercorn shrimp and calamari has got to be the house joke . three tiny shrimp , not even measuring an inch in diameter , along with rings of calamari so minuscule they resembled small rubber bands . not kidding . why , half the fun of eating calamari is grossing your friends out by hanging all the tentacles halfway out of your mouth ... then sucking them in , in a mighty swoosh . major disappointment . malee 's . if you think your fabulous sauces are going to wow me , getting me to overlook how you just cheated me out of fifteen bucks , you 're wrong . i do n't like gnawing on lemongrass sticks either . leave them off . they do nothing for the presentation , save for tricking your average thai food novice into taking a bite . this would be like an american restaurant leaving bay leaves in everything and having thai people thinking its something you eat . shame on you . i did n't like the spinach chicken either . same chicken base and sauce as is in many of the other chicken dishes , only it 's ladled over fresh , uncooked spinach leaves . you could n't have put less effort into this dish if you tried . this is the vanna white of thai dishes . maybe this is how you survive the summer months when the tourists are gone . i 'm out .		1		0

after a few visits to cityscape , phoenix 's supposedly ` exciting urban infill ' development , i must say it is even worse that i expected . far from being an authentic urban development that takes into account the surrounding urban fabric , it is yet another suburban development dropped on our city 's downtown core . i guess i was naive to expect anything different from a project conceived in a scottsdale business park . some observations : * cityscape 's idea of urban form is to place a large-scale suburban pharmacy on one corner of the development and an elevator lobby on another corner . so much for encouraging an active street life or pedestrian activity downtown . * the supposed ` park ' to replace the publicly owned patriots park , is not really a park , but an outdoor arcade on private property surrounded by buildings . basically , this ` park ' is designed for the office dwellers and patrons of the complex , not the citizens and residents of downtown phoenix . * while i do n't have a problem with oakville grocery per se -lrb- especially if it keeps its promise to stock locally produced goods -rrb- , i do take issue with is the conceit that it is a ` grocery store ' that will meet the needs of downtown residents . there is only so much demand for handmade cheeses and gourmet sandwiches in downtown -lrb- and besides the phoenix public market already offers these items and more . -rrb- cityscape represents yet another failed attempt to revitalize downtown . it is basically a morphing of downtown 's last two failed ` urban infill ' attempts : collier center and arizona center . both these were supposed to enhance downtown 's urban fabric . both failed miserably at this goal . the various civic ` leaders ' who continue to push such misguided projects need to wake up . instead of facilitating a downtown that all residents can enjoy , they have continued on the futile quest to keep suburbanites and tourists downtown after ball games or conventions by creating a suburban haven in the middle of the city . these so-called leaders need to realize that what 's needed downtown is n't foisting another new mega-project on us . rather , we as a broad-based community need to radically rethink how we approach development . until that happen , phoenix will never realize the potential of being ` arizona 's urban heart . '' developments such as cityscape do n't take us closer to a true downtown ; they move us further away . in phoenix 's desperate attempt to attract suburban tourists , downtown is morphing into a suburb itself .		1		0
the reason i give pink taco one star is because i have n't gotten a table there yet . last weekend some friends and i decided to check it out . my boyfriend and i were pretty excited because we have n't had a chance to eat there yet , and we wanted to see if it lived up to the hype . much to our dismay because we were a group of six we were told we would n't get a table until 10 pm . it was 7:30 ! now i realize it was a saturday night and pink taco is evidently still very popular , but that is just ridiculous ! hopefully i can add on to this review in the future , but right now i 'm no hurry to go back .		1		0
this is terrible food . i 've had some not so great chinese food before , but this place is by far the worst . it does n't help to call it `` asian '' to avoid authenticity complaints . it 's just bad . the beef must have been soaking in soy sauce for a week . i love salty food , but i developed hypertension after eating here . the sweet sauce in the `` general chi '' style -lrb- whatever that is -rrb- was entirely too sweet to pass for anything . the beef was very tough and completely overcooked . the orange chicken was the only mildly redeeming dish because i could eat more than a few bites without being overwhelmed with salt or sugar . i do n't mean to overstated this : it was the worst meal i 've had in phoenix .		1		0
blerg . i went here for the ignite after hours event -lrb- great event , bad location -rrb- . i do n't like clubs first of all and i do n't like egotistical bar tenders who think they can treat you like an idiot . i had 3 drinks at myst -lrb- the same drink -rrb- and got charged a different price by each bar tender . the first drink was $ 5 , then the second was $ 6 and the last guy was the winner for douch-tarded-ness . he told me my drink was $ 7 , but when i got the tab he ran my card for $ 8 . wtf ??? so no tip for you ... plus they are all sort of jerky ... i 'm not into that . you are in the customer service industry , so attempt to be nice . the first bartender i encountered was pleasant , but he disappeared after i ordered my drink . the other two thought they were god 's gift and that was the end of that . boo you myst , i will only come back if ignite after hours is there again , but not on my own accord .		1		0

i walked in and i was immediately digusted by this place . want a crap load of peanuts ? no seriously , when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts , and you can get as much as you want ! done with the shells ? just leave them on the table then brush them aside . the end result ? a restaurant with peanut shells all over the place . actually , to be quite honest , i 'm being a little harsh here . i thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing , but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else . well , when i got my food i figured out what they were trying to compensate for . the salad and ` breadsticks ' were just plain bad . however , i did n't really expect much . i was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side . the wings are nothing special at all . i thought the ` el hefe ' wings were somewhat decent , but i do n't think i could have more than a half-dozen of those . hot wings ? what hot wings ? i thought i ordered some , but maybe the waiter got confused . i got some cold wings with red sauce on them , they tasted ` vinegary ' and that 's about all . to be fair , the service was pretty good and the server was friendly . she was helping us make decisions since it was our first time , but the food was cold on multiple occasions . a previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff ... not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food , go to a strip club ? maybe if the food was hot it could be different , but i really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark . there is really nothing special about this place . the wings are over priced for what you get , and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here . i love wings , and i 've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in phoenix , but i think my search continues for the time being .		1		0
my wife and i and our two son have for years gone to haus murphy for christmas eve dinner . we all have lived in germany for an extended time and a german dinner for our family and our son 's wive and girlfriend so a christmas eve german dinner has become a tradition . the year before last the woman who runs the place did n't treat us very well -lrb- a party of 6 -rrb- . we tried again last year and they treated us even more shamefully . we all decided that our experience with haus murphy has come to an end . it 's a shame but each time , the woman has pushed us impatiently to finish and we 'd made reservations for 7:00 but none the less the lady did everything but put our order in a box and shove us out the door . even something as simple as bread with dinner was with held . perhaps any other time of the year but not on christmas eve . if they do n't want customers on the 24th , they should just close for the day .		1		0
if you do n't serve an egg substitue , say so . chopped egg is not an egg substitue . egg whites are not an egg substitute . a tablespoon of watery `` gravy '' over a nearly flat biscuit does n't work . bacon should be crisp and unburnt - ready to go . not charred , flaccid and greasy - as if already spent . scrambled eggs should be fluffy , or at least not dry and rubbery . unless stated on your menu , your eggs should not contain quantities of black pepper or other spices . this is dangerous . you do n't know who might be violently allergic . tasted bad to boot . the chunk potatoes were undercooked , even though asked for crispy . the tastiest part of the meal was the chorizo potato soup . the chorizo could have had several tablespoons of grease drained in the kitchen and would still have been quite greasy - and not floating across the plate . still , it was the best dish of the morning . . sigh . what was looking to be a promising new place is showing signs of apathy towards is customers already . quality slipping , lame excuses by staff `` we make our own egg substitute '' , - it 's just disappointing . i may not be back for a while .		1		0

you have got ta be kidding me reviewers ! this place was neither tasty or satisfying , it was n't cost effective , it was n't great service . it was n't even good food . let 's start with the salsa . there is nothing chunky or spicy or fresh about it , it is sweet tomato sauce with a bit of onion in it . if this is salsa ragu missed the boat by - this - much . it is most certainly not prepared there and is the absolutely worst salsa i have ever been served . i took one dip and i asked the waitress if they had any other types of salsa available . she said no . my partner said `` it sort of grows on you , '' so i dipped a few more times and all that grew on me were questions as to how a mexican restaurant was calling this salsa . i was considering an exit strategy , but we decided to let the food determine our visit . looking around the place , it was near empty , except for a large family table , a senior age couple and another couple our age who were also visiting for the first time . i know because they were asking all the questions i had about the menu . interesting layout allows you to watch the cooks plate up the food . this can either be a great experience or a fearful one . good lord how many onions are being put on the sizzling plate ? what is being poured out of a deep frying basket over them ? i do n't think this bodes well . i ordered the half pound beef fajita . my sizzling experience was that of two cups of undercooked white onion , one ring of green pepper and a tiny ring of red pepper . sliced fajita meat that was charred and chewy perhaps dropped in the fryer ? tortillas which were completely uneven in thickness and sizes -lrb- i guess that means they are homemade , right ? -rrb- they were almost too cold to fold and were damp from being steamed warm i think . ew . still i was hungry and going to make this work . my condiment plates shredded cheese was fused together as if someone had scooped it partially melted with an ice cream scoop . the sour cream was plentiful but warm . i desperately wanted to add the chopped tomatoes to the salsa bowl , it seems they belonged there , but there were only enough of them for one fajita so i did n't . the only way i was going to get these fajitas to be remotely tasty was request some lime . fortunately i was able to secure some juicy wedges which helped . my partner said they liked the beef jerky meat , but it 's not what i had in mind . at all . that 's ok , the border dinner was sure to please them , right ? no . it should have been left at the border and denied entry into the states . the congealed enchiladas held the fork in an upright position and refused to be edible . the charro beans were only edible if you pierced the plastic shell of dried beans on top and dug out some bite from the middle . my partner who loves rice did n't even scoop a bite of the spanish rice a roni provided . the dinner salad was a wilted ranch dressing mess and was useful only to put on one of my fajitas . i thought it would add some crunch . it did n't . we stared at the fried tortilla cup that held the queso . under the skin the cheese heart was beating . seriously , it wanted to live ! it would shudder periodically as if something was swimming beneath the surface . heat , i imagine , is all that made it percolate , but we had reached a stage in this dinner where we knew it was a bust and everything became fodder for jokes . i am never going back and i thought others should know that outback and lone star are in the same vicinity . make a better choice . $ 33 dollars . was n't it 33 pieces of silver that betrayed jesus ? these positive reviews were a judas kiss , folks .		1		0
i just do n't know how you can screw up a burger . but these guys are so disorganized , they do . i can promise you , i wo n't go back . ever . last night , for example , i was using a coupon , a make-good for an earlier visit that went off the rails , as a matter of fact . the coupon was good for a cheeseburger . `` how much would you charge to make it a double ? '' , i asked . if i had waited for an answer , i 'd still be there ! when they asked if i wanted cheese -lrb- they perpetually ask you if you want cheese . and if you decline , when they read back your order , they actually say , `` double char -- no cheese !! '' -- etc. '' -rrb- when your burger is ready , the beeper you 've been given goes off . except when it does n't . and your burger just sits there , on the island , getting cold . here or to go ? they ask you and almost always screw it up . and it 's on the ticket . so why the problems ? the manager is not interested . he 's in his office most of the time , away from cooking burgers and customers . wait . is n't the precisely the reason he 's supposed to be there ? i do n't care if he owns the joint . if he does n't like burgers or customers , and clearly he does not , he should find a job driving . if you go to mcdonald 's and order your burger , any burger , grilled to order -lrb- just ask for something , anything differeent : extra pickes , ketchup , anything -rrb- it 's better than the hobit . errrrrrrr habit . not a habit for me !		1		0
first , if your a dodgers fan you will love this park . i 'm a stl fan and love the game of baseball in general especially spring training . we went to the friday night game and watched the dodgers and the giants . it was a good game and i enjoyed hanging out with the family in the lawn seats . there was over 11,000 fans at the game . the game start time was 705pm and i do n't recommend going to a night game here . getting to the ballpark is a hassle during this time because you are going to get caught up with rush hour traffic . the concession stands had long lines at least until the 4th inning . the prices were typical of a major event . food was decent . i enjoyed chicken tenders and fries for $ 6.75 . at the end of the game they had a post game fireworks show . it was awesome and i think it takes place on friday 's if there is a night game . overall , i wo n't be attending this ball park again for spring training . it does n't give you the spring training feel . its too big . however , it does offer an up close experience to the batting cages , practice fields and the dodger players around the lake . in closing , the tickets to the games are too expensive for a spring training game and it does n't even offer a spring training experience .		1		0
i got engaged after eating at macayo 's many , many , many moons ago -lrb- hubbie figured a fancy night out would tip his hand -rrb- . i used to dine at this location nearly every friday in the mid 90s when i started at intel . since then , i have been underwhelmed each time i have visited . last visit : toilet had overflowed in the women 's bathroom , living one stall availalble for an ` ick ' experience . couple that with the out-dated , disheleved looking front lobby and i washed my hands of an old stand-by . adios macayo 's .		1		0

i used to like their food honestly . it was my one year anniversary . me and me man went here to celebrate i had a lobster tail and a filet on the way home , i got violently ill like , within ten minutes of leaving this place . and no , i only had a few glasses of champagne : -rrb- i ended up going home , and laying on the floor for awhile crying , moaning , vomiting , etc after about an hour , i could n't take it anymore i called 911 the paramedics showed up , i was naked and crying on the floor . it was a very romantic anniversary , let me tell you . after a long night at scottsdale osborn hospital , it was determined that the lobster tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill . i 'll never eat here again . simply because i 've never been so sick . it 's a shame though , because on the way down , the lobster tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious . however i contacted ruths chris and they refunded my dinner amount , paid my hospital copay , and were sooo nice and accomodating to my every demand . bravo . although , boo for almost killing me . eh , i 'm torn .		1		0
yuk ! i tried this place based on seeing favorable reviews on yelp , but this is not good thai food . i 'm not sure why people think this is good . the food is not very fresh and does not taste like it should . i guess if you have never tried good thai food , this might be good to you . do n't waste your time and money if you are looking for a quality thai meal .		1		0

horrid . i will occasionally determine whether i will attend a show based whether my love for the band outweighs my disdain for the clubhouse . some key points , in no particular order : staggeringly hot -- i left the walkmen show early because i thought i was going to pass out . -lrb- when the band onstage complains that it 's hot , they 're probably not just making conversation ... -rrb- horrible sound , especially if you are forced to stand in front of the speakers , which is hard to avoid . bathrooms ? stifling , inadequate and revolting . beer sign that shines into the crowd and distracts from the acts on stage ? annoying . random discarded yard sale items stored in the bar area ? really ? ever heard of a storage room ? the fact that you have to stand by the sticky-floored bar area far away from the stage if you 're drinking ? ridiculous . why do bands play here ? one of the great mysteries of the universe . especially when there are places like the rhythm room nearby . the only positive thing i have to say is the guys they have staffed at the front door are always friendly . added bonus : hope you enjoy taking your friend to the impound lot -lrb- it 's across the street from tempe marketplace -rrb- because more than one of my friends has been towed from this lot before . so , if there 's a sign warning you will be towed over the space you 're parking in , believe it .		1		0
quality ingredients and good recipes ruined by bad chefs . the caesar salad had no flavor . it tasted like lettuce , water and shaved parmesan . the pepperoni pizza had obviously been sitting a while . it was so dried out and all the pepperoni slices were even curled up at the edges . the crust was like bisquick . it tasted just like a frozen pizza . the chipotle barbecue chicken sandwich was served ice cold , which i guess is ok but they really need to warn you . it 's not too much of a stretch to assume a barbecue sandwich will be hot . $ 17 dollars later , and we 're still hungry . their routine is way too complicated for them not to be on the lookout for newbies and tell them what to do . they seemed to get their entertainment sitting quietly behind their counters watching all the customers wander around aimlessly like bumper cars . thanks guys .		1		0
being in this bar makes me feel dirty . there are always the creepiest of the creepy guys inside and the girls that look like their fake ids were n't good enough to get them into a good bar on mill . the music is always insanely loud -lrb- and not even good , usually -rrb- . highlight : the outdoor patio . i 'm a sucker for outdoor dining/drinking		1		0
promised myself after my last visit that i shall never return . that was 2.5 years ago and i have n't been back since ! went in and sat down in a booth , had dinner , ordered some drinks . we had been there about an hour -lrb- dinner + 2 rounds -rrb- when our server came over and said , we need to give her a credit card because our tab was over $ 50 and we were sitting close enough to the door we could walk out on it . i looked her square in the eye and asked if she thought maybe there might be a better way to word that , like `` i 'm sorry guys , i forgot to take a card to start your tab , do you think you could provide one ? '' she got very defensive and started telling me how people walk out on tabs by the door , so again , why did n't you just get one to start with instead of coming to our table in a combative manner . the bar is actually pretty cool , but that little bitch sealed the deal that i will never return , nor will i recommend it to any of my friends . ever . we paid the tab , left a $ 20 tip on a $ 50 bill , and left .		1		0
had some time to kill before the ultimate pley date yelp event , and i 'd wanted to share my love of nobuo 's dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin , who has never been here before , so we stopped by at 5:17 p to find that nobuo would n't open till 5:30 p , so we waited outside in the comfortable patio . after watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables , i noticed the `` open '' sign on the front door , so we entered the resto , whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top . i did n't like the energy in that room , so i asked if we could sit elsewhere , and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit . we were the first customers , so we chose a four-top , knowing we would n't be taking up space for very long , anyway . glasses of water were delivered , and soon we met our female server -lrb- whose name on the receipt reflected `` butai '' -rrb- . when she laid down the menus , i told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu ? i wished we had a video of the look she gave us , a look of pure distaste , as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said `` we do n't have dessert menus , as we only have two ... '' and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters . she walked away , and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there , she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have . i decided to forgo our server 's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse . after all , i 'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin 's phone needed recharging ... when butai placed our chocolate mousse http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0buxoc0crqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rk8m1rxl50pb69_c2yqqtg#rk8m1rxl50pb69_c2yqqtg on the table , i wanted to send it back . where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert i had here ? was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse , with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it ? i do n't know about you , but the only times i 've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze . for me , seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old ... i brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host , who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00 a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal , so i decided we would go ahead and try it , if for nothing else but to have something to report here . the dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0buxoc0crqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jiksb-mobhcxoi_msekq#o9jiksb-mobhcxoi_msekq i had during our october oye in taste and presentation , but it was ok . the mousse was still cold and stiff , and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake - certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence i knew it could be . my cousin had to warm up to the dish , as the sound of chocolate and green tea together did n't seem like a great combo to her -lrb- i told her to trust me -rrb- . she also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together , but she liked it in this dessert . i understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner and dessert , which translates to a higher table bill , can be a bit of a disappointment , but why must you show your displeasure to your guests ? butai , you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip - she did n't want to give you anything , and you certainly did n't deserve it ! when i told other yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had , one replied she did n't enjoy the last time we had apps here -lrb- i think it was around halloween and first friday ? -rrb- either . cousin and i thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful , condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert ; we did n't deserve that ! i am never going to recommend nobuo to anyone , anymore . i even promised my japanese friend -lrb- who lives and works overseas -rrb- i 'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit . guess i 'll have to find another place to take her ... i do n't want to risk getting the same treatment from butai , or from another server should we come back here . sorry , nobuo , but i wo n't be returning .		1		0

it may be cool and trendy but the service is not all that great the lobby is kind of dirty and the glass that separates to the bar/restaurant to lobby is kind of dirty the only thing it 's really spectaculars is the pool and then the view from the top of the roof that would be about it .		1		0
i think this place was more style of substance . my husband and i could not find what we were looking for , and the menu was no where near what you would expect from a sushi restaurant , very limited selection with the rolls . and i would have expected better food than what we paid for . one other thing the hostess greeted us and told us that it would be a 15 min . wait to be seated in the restaurant , and that we should grab a drink at the bar . as soon as we walked over to the bar i see a group leave some table , and tell my husband lets go there and sit and wait . while waiting the waitress victoria comes up and says that we could order dinner here too . so that it what we did which was fine . the only things is the hostess never came back to check up on us to see where we were . i really think that 's poor hostessing skills .		1		0
a friend of my husband 's gave him a gift card to this place and told him they had great food . we decided to give it a try . there were four in our party and we were lucky to get a table since it is a very , very small restaurant . items ordered between the party of four : italian wedding soup , eggplant parm , pasta with bolognese sauce , house salad and pizza with sausage , onion and basil . the pizza barely had any onions on it . very little sauce and cheese . i did n't try the eggplant parm , pasta or italian wedding soup but other party members stated the food was average . one of the reasons i 'm giving it only one star is due to very poor customer service the waiter could barely speak english then when we presented our gift card the owner came out an told us he would not accept the gift card . he stated the gift cards were purchased when someone else owned the restaurant and he was not obligated to honor it . there was no way we would know this as the gift card we were given had the same restaurant logo as is currently in use . my husband 's friend would have no way of knowing this restaurant was sold or when it was sold . this place is in a bad neighborhood too . i did n't feel too safe around there .		1		0
how is this place still open ? tried it numerous times simply for the geographical convenience . every time the food is horrible . last experience included gross bloody mary 's not work the two bucks , an overcooked and under seasoned salmon , soggy greasy fries and bad service . i will not come back here .		1		0
i was so excited to come here , especially after seeing their menu and pictures online . i went with my partner and some friends to see the samba project , which was live music on the patio . first of all , you had to pay $ 5 in addition to food and drink in order to listen to the music . keep in mind the food starts at $ 10 a person , so with drinks , you 're now paying at least $ 20 to listen to good , albeit not great music . i walk with a cane . our friends had gotten their earlier , and were waiting for the table , and my partner and i waited with them . standing . for over 30 minutes . no one offered us a seat , and after half an hour , i had shooting pain , so i went to ask the hostess a -rrb- how long it would be , and b -rrb- if they had a seat . i started talking to her , and explained i was disabled , and she actually said `` hold on a bit '' and took a party of 2 to go stand and wait . i told her i was just going sit in my car and wait then , and she just shook her head and walked off . what an incredibly non-disability friendly place . finally -lrb- having got there at 8 -rrb- , we got sat a little before 9 . our waiter did n't come for another 15 minutes , and our drinks ? around 9:30 or so . my partner and i ordered iced tea , expecting regular iced tea . instead , it was sickly sweet and peach flavored . neither of us liked it . when the server asked how my tea was , i let him know i did n't like peach . he never asked if i wanted something else , even when i asked for a glass of water and moved my tea to the middle , and when my partner said no to tea refills , even before the food showed up . finally , i just told him to take away my glass . the only positive ? he took it off the check -lrb- but not my partner 's -rrb- . the food ? let 's see , until almost 9:45 , we only had one menu . finally , we asked for more , and got them , and were ready to order at about 9:50 . again , we had to wait a huge amount of time to order , and then the food took almost a full hour to come out ... for 3 paninis and an order of bruschetta . i mean , did they bake the bread fresh ? it was ok . good , but not great . i 'd say postino 's was better by far on both the paninis and the bruschetta . then of course , it took us forever to get the check ... which then came back in wet check holders , etc. . the atmosphere ? lovely . i loved the wall of candle and the couch we were on was super comfy . but it should n't take almost 3 hours to get something to eat -lrb- we were sat around 9 , left at 10 till midnight -rrb- , and the lack of caring from the hostess and service from the server earned this restaurant/wine bar one star ... the second ever 1 star i 've given .		1		0
if you actually look at my reviews you will find that i have reviewed many local places and given them high marks . this place is the exception . walking in and the bartender was coughing into his hands and touching pizza boxes with pizzas already in them and pouring drinks and touching receipts . disgusting . the pizza itself was below average . decent crust but very few toppings and the sauce is done in their signature way where they put round dollops of sauce every so often on the crust instead of everywhere . i 'll take everywhere . there was nothing but crust in several spots , bland as hell , and lame . we were grossed out by the bartender and could n't hardly eat anyways but we actually gave it a try . i will never spend another dime in this location .		1		0
not a fan . i truly believe people are tricked by the decor . it really does make you feel cute and happy , but it 's like a wolf in sheeps clothing bc the food and service suck . this applies to every fox concept , i 've decided . our waiter was a diva , and not in a good way . he rolled his eyes at me several times and all i did was ask for lemon with my water . then i asked for vinegar and oil on the side instead of on my salad . it came on my salad so i asked politley if i could have a new side salad . he got so pissed and grabbed my plate without saying anything . when he returned he just slammed it down in my face . i would have walked out if i was n't with people . i hate rude servers . then i ordered the kobe burger and it was burnt on the outside . and it had no flavor . i had to salt and pepper the crap out of it . last time i pay $ 17 for a gross burger and rude service , i do n't care how effing cute your patio is .		1		0
i think that this is probably one of the more authentic mexican food restaurants that i have been to and if you really want to add extra kick to your meal , try a prickly pear margarita . boy - those things will definitely add some intrigue to your night or at the very least some good laughs . if you go , plan extra time to sit and wait for a table because chances are unless you are very lucky , you will have to wait quite awhile to be seated . but , i think that it is worth the wait . amendment , may 2008 - i have co-workers in town for a trade show . a few nights ago , i suggested los dos for dinner . i warned them that the service was slow but the food is always good . we agreed to try it . we arrived at 7:15 ish . half of our party was n't there - so in order to not be rude and take up a table , we ordered some drinks , chips & guacamole and took a table outside to wait . at around 8 , we were still minus 2 guests and starving . so , i went in and got us a table . i 'd say our other 2 finally showed up around 8:30 . we did not get greeted by a waiter until 9pm - an hour after sitting . had he come up to us in the beginning , i would have told him that we were going to just order as a partial party . but no one even asked . they sent over a nice guy that could only take our drinks and kept saying that he 'd bring us a waiter . right before the waiter finally appeared , i walked up the hostess stand and let them know that it really had been far too long to be waiting . there were 2 girls behind the stand and a busboy -lrb- not really sure what his position was considering most of the night he ogled these 2 girls and stood scratching his head at the hostess stand - maybe he was the third hostess ? -rrb- . they were pretty rude to me and continued to get ruder through out the night . unfortunately , i had such a bad experience that i will no longer be recommending this place to anyone . i 'm rating it a one star - down from 4 stars . i was embarrassed that my co-workers had to see such a nasty side of my fellow arizonans . i will not be returning to los dos molinos . i have had a lot of poor service here - but i always took the bad with the good because the food is good . but , they just crossed the line too far this time and i wo n't support a place that treats me -lrb- the customer -rrb- badly . i work in the service industry from time to time at trade shows . i know that people have their bad days and i know that it can be hard to always meet every customers needs - but i also know that i do my very best to be kind and helpful to every customer no matter what mood i am in and i expect the same in return if i am spending money for a service .		1		0
i live down the street from casey moore 's . i have been here a total of three times . the first time a group of us just ordered drinks , and the margaritas my friend and i ordered were so terrible that we sent them back . the second time i went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich . again , it was so awful i had to send it back . i am not a picky eater , nor have i been known to complain about food or service when dining out . there has only been one other restaurant i have ever been to where i sent food back . so , this place was already two for two . alas , my husband begged me to go back once more . he was craving oysters and since this is an oyster house , i figured it would n't hurt to give them one more shot . it was last thursday evening , and the place was hoppin ' . this time , the food was decent . not good , but decent enough where i may have given casey moore 's a fourth chance had i been impressed with the service . but the service was horrible . our waitress got us our drinks and did n't come back to take our orders for another 20 minutes . we sat there awkwardly waiting for her to stop by , and though she passed us quickly several times , she never even acknowledged us with a simple `` i 'll be back with your orders . '' when she did arrive 20 minutes later , she asked if we were ready to order without even an apology . i am not kidding you when i say she acted like she wanted nothing to do with us . she was very monotone and never smiled with us . i would like to pass this off as her having a bad night , but when she went to her other tables -lrb- all full of men with drinks -rrb- she suddenly lit up , laughed , and had a blast with them . it was so awkward to the point that my husband asked if maybe we knew her and had upset her in some way in the past . but no . this was our first time meeting her . we were pleasant customers who did n't complain about the mediocre food or slow service . we were polite and left a good tip . we pride ourselves on being fun , engaging , and polite with our servers since we go out often . but let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry . we live so damn close to this place and would have loved to be regulars ... it is such a shame that casey moore 's has now given us three good reasons to never come back . and i ca n't find any information on their website of how to contact the manager about this , so i am left to rant here on yelp , completely unsatisfied . sigh ...		1		0
so sad , maybe it used to be good ? but it sucks now , they had a few stores that i enjoyed that are all gone in only the past couple years and not much is left it is almost empty -lrb- wtbleep some really good stores were there !! -rrb- they are even clearing out rows to make more parking ??? i went recently to order a gift and the store was gone like all the others i liked . so sad		1		0
never going back . when we got there , we were like `` wait , is this mr. sushi ? or akaihana sushi ? '' since the restaurant has both names in front . when you go in , you see the sushi counter with one japanese chef and rest , mexican chefs . they seated us at the very back corner where it was pretty dark ... it was so dark that we had to squint our eyes to see the menu . there were screaming kids , squeaking fans all over and waitresses having fun chatting . the food ... omg , it 's as bad as ra . we ordered combination plate b. , i. , and `` mistake '' roll . believe me they are all bad ... afterwards , i got a tummy ache ... . sigh . * ambiance = dark , low-class * service = if you like your waitresses having fun chatting about their relationships and stuff , yeah you will like it * food = ... bad - beef teriyaki = tough - sashimi = it 's interesting how a japanese person can serve that proudly and call it sashimi . - california roll = we usually do our best to finish the plate but it was just not possible . - tempura = ok overall but they definitely use old oil - rice = cheap rice for sure .		1		0
the single handed worst breakfast experience i 've ever had . the only time i 've ever waited over 50 minutes for a table before giving up . i came alone on a saturday at 9am . i asked how long the wait would be for a party of one and the hostess -lrb- i guess you could call her that -rrb- stated that , `` they do n't quote times , but that it goes fast . '' they do n't write down the time you arrive so either management does n't care how long the patrons are waiting for a table or are to dumb to look into it . i find it rude , disrespectful , and disingenuous to patrons to not quote a time on one hand while saying it goes fast on the other . they must have known that patrons were waiting close to an hour for a seat and they are hoping that we would become `` pot committed '' and hang out for the table . maybe they are hoping that you will wait so long that you get so hungry that the food will taste better . i 've eaten at matt 's big breakfast before and i would give it 4 out of 5 stars on food quality . they are n't spectacular just good . sadly phoenix is deeply lacking in good breakfast joints . so starving after a 50 minute wait i decided to head home and stop at mcdonalds -lrb- also a one star restaurant , but at least i wo n't wait 50 minutes to get to place my order -rrb- . while en route i drove by lo lo 's chicken and waffles approx . 2 miles from matt 's big -lrb- slow -rrb- breakfast and noticed that it was fairly empty at 10am . i pulled in to lo lo 's and was pleasantly surprised to find a hidden gem for breakfast . how about that the worst breakfast experience turns into one of the best . i was immediately sat at a table -lrb- there was enough space for 8 person parties . coffee was promptly brought and it was perfect in every respect of the word . i ordered the breakfast sandwich and i was dumbfounded why i tried to go back to matt 's big -lrb- slow -rrb- breakfast with so many other options available . two additional points i 'd like to make : first , there was a bunch of people waiting for matt 's big -lrb- slow -rrb- breakfast but it was n't a constant flow of additional people coming it was the same bunch of people waiting for 50 + minutes ; second , you 've been warned . if you want to try something different/unique/and worthwhile give lo lo 's chicken and waffles a shot at breakfast . i do n't mind waiting for a table at a desirable restaurant . what i mind is a restaurant that does n't value it 's patrons enough to respect their time and to allow their patrons to make conscious decision if they want to wait or not .		1		0
back in the day i used to drive all the way from surprise to eat here , yes the food was that good . they used to have the most killer pollo fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa . time has certainly changed this place . . we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles , delicious . . nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips . . also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as i remember it . then come my pollo fundido swimming , im serious about this , swimming in a pool of grease !! they did n't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate . was disgusting too , not even like clear oil but dark brown grease . vile . then the misters sampler showed up . . this thing was a fucking mess ! you could n't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite . mini chimis were burnt , mini tacos burnt , tamales , cold and hard . . was a complete wreck . after a few bites we called it . . major loss of appetite . . a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible . meanwhile , the mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here . . he was sick all day the next too . . so word of caution , eat here at your own risk . im sure going to miss the good meals i used to have here , what a real shame .		1		0
food took forever to arrive and when it did , it was a disappointment . salad was quite sour , and the grill meats was dry and did n't have much flavor to it . did n't seem like much food , but the bill sure was a surprise !! the only interesting thing they have is belly dancing and salsa dancing for the night .		1		0
why the hell does this place always smell like a dirty wet rag !?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! and the service suxx .		1		0
i would love to be able to review the food / drinks for this ` hot ' spot , however i ca n't ! i called around 1pm on a friday to reserve a table that night for a friend 's birthday celebration . i reserved a table for 10 people at 10pm ; and told the host that answered the phone i would call back around 8:30 to let them know if the number of guests would be significantly less than 10 -lrb- he had said it is hard to hold a spot for 10 people that late ... i thought i was being helpful by offering to do so ... -rrb- i called that night around 8:50 pm -lrb- 20 minutes late , i know ... -rrb- to let them know it would only be 8 people , not 10 . i was told by a different hostess that answered the phone that my reservation was at 8:30 , and i had missed it . i explained to the hostess there must be a mistake , and that my reservation was at 10pm , not 8:30 . she said that no , my reservation was at 8:30 , and the table was gone , and there really was n't anything that i could do . i asked to speak to a manager , as now we would be scrambling to find a new spot , should the reservation not go through . -lrb- ** note , you do not need a table to go to primebar , however it was the birthday girl wanted , so i wanted to make that happen . -rrb- the manager , sean , got on the phone , and told me that i had missed my reservation , and that they had called me two times to see if we 'd be coming , but i never answered . now , seeing as that my phone had n't rung at all that night , i asked sean if he had me confused with someone else . -lrb- hey , mix-ups happen ! -rrb- sean then told me that he is sure they had called me , yet would n't confirm the number dialed , and continued to speak over me and not answer my questions about if there was anything we could do to get a table set aside for us . due to his ` jerkiness ' i said he was being a real jacka $ $ , as i was trying bring him business . he then got really mad , and said `` listen , deary , this is how this is going to work '' and `` this is what we are going to do '' and other ridiculous comments -lrb- during this time , i was n't getting a word in edgewise , he just kept repeating how i messed up and that we could n't have a table , etc etc -rrb- . it was really shocking how nasty and vile his attitude was . he was n't interested in all in problem solving , but rather a power-trip and scolding me was all he focused on . i then was forwarded to speak to his general manager , matt , who was nicer , but did n't apologize for the mix-up or for sean 's ridiculous behavior . he offered to buy a round of drinks for us , should we go there at a later date . . but i politely declined . i am shocked and appalled at what primebar considers to be ` customer service ' . to the management 's credit , i did speak to the marketing director of the scottsdale quarter today , and she was very nice and apologetic ; however she does n't run the day-to-day operations of primebar . based on the other reviews it looks like the food is pretty good - but i can say that the management team they have in there is horrible ... which ca n't bode well for the rest of the staff .		1		0
they 're getting better at separating bills and not having mysterious drinks appear on your own tab . if jasmine did n't work there , i 'd have no reason to go to this location anymore . i was told to stop giving hot chicks piggy back rides . seriously ? no redbull ? wtf !?!?!		1		0
in my husband 's opinion , `` i 'd rather eat at fazoli 's '' ... and i do n't think i 've ever seen him eat at a fazoli 's in the 6 years we 've been together . we were enthusiastic to try this neighborhood spot and as a former concierge , i heard a lot about the history of this place . my only thoughts now are , `` what the hell happened ? '' we 've been in twice and both times the owner has been drinking in the same bar stool to an empty or almost empty bar top . the decor and lighting are almost as offensive as the neon-clad place down the street . the bread `` basket '' is plastic and the bread is wrapped in an unfolded dinner napkin ... it 's stale and dull , like it 's been nuked in that napkin after being defrosted . the dipping oil is low grade oil and filled with dried herbs ... c'mon ... fresh herbs are so cheap and readily available and taste so much better . the caesar salad was just gross - swimming in overly bitter dressing that made the whole thing a soggy mess . the spaghetti and meatballs were so lackluster - the middle of the meatball was cold . the sauce was bland , the pasta just bad . i hate that what seemed like a respectable , family establishment turned into this . we made the mistake of coming in twice . we 'll never be back again . i 'd rather eat oregano 's . in my husband 's second opinion , `` i 'd rather eat prego . '' again ... we 've never prego in the house ...		1		0
what ; the fuck ! there is a huuuge rift in the taste bud department . i really do n't know how to say this without completely insulting some reviewers but do you have any fucking taste buds ? how the hell does this shitbox get 4 solid stars and over 100 reviews ?????? please , someone ? this is garbage . garbage . it has been awhile since i 've eaten at a chain restaurant and it will be another decade before i do again it seems . here is what i know , this is what i 've eaten . gnocchi w / sausage in a vodka cream sauce . i do n't care if the sausage was good or if the sauce was perfect . the gnocchi was terrible ! gummy , dense , thick....dees-custing . lobster carbonara . overall taste was fair , sauce had binded and really became bulky whilst mid pasta twist . snap pea pods in the dish ?? peas ... definately . pods ... way to sweet and distinct . service was terrible ... terrible . there are many italian restaurants in arizona . this so far has been the worst for me . the other 5 diners agree too . dismal white clam sauce , bready , heavy meatball 's , tough raviolis . the only standout ... . grilled poundcake ... it was descent .		1		0
awful and no service , the food is not good anymore , plus they give old and stale bread , dust and webs on the ceiling fans and no one cares .		1		0
thank god we live in america . i ca n't imagine that this could be the standard in another country . i have been to next-door los compadres hundreds of times , but never ventured into diamonds . it 's a weird chinese looking building , but as many times as i 've driven by , i 'd never gone in . until recently . my brother and i resolved to finally check it out . we parked in back and made our way toward the front door . there was water streaming across the driveway into the gutter , and white bits of something were strewn throughout . i did n't think much of it at the time . when we opened the door , we were instantly greeted with the sight , sound and smell of 5 huge aquariums , all holding seafood that presumably was going to be eaten soon . i got the distinct impression that the floor had n't been swept in three or four months . after we made our order and sat waiting for our take out , i noticed a large brown spot on the front of the counter . hmmm ... and then it moved . oh my god . this is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life . it must have been five inches long . i was mortified such that i could not find my voice . and then a second one appeared , and then a third . omg . i finally got the manager 's attention and pointed to it . she quickly moved to the front of the counter , and cupping her hand , caught it , and then scurried back to the kitchen with it . i was going to be sick . i ran toward the bathroom , and found myself splashing through a big puddle all the way to the toilet . ugh . the toilet was already full from someone before me . so i flushed . and then came the most wrong sound you 've ever heard come from a water pipe as and what was in the toilet started rising to the top . i fled and grabbed my brother by the arm . as i squished my way back along the walkway toward the driveway , i realized what was streaming across the parking lot and into the gutter . it was raw sewage littered with bits of wet toilet paper . someone needs to shut this place down .		1		0
so , i went here the first time like 2 and a half yrs ago . i really liked it , so i decided to go there when someone gave me a gift certificate there . i ordered a burrito and my girlfriend ordered a grilled chicken breast . she was eating it and was like this taste soo bad . i was like let me try ! i took one bite and the chicken tasted soo badly of fish it was soo gross . why would the chicken taste like fish ?!?! well needless to say she got food poisoning and had to miss work for the next day . although they do have a tranny that works there and she is really nice . we always get her as our server and she gave us the `` family `` discount when we came . but , i wont eat there again		1		0
okay ... i do n't know if they realized that they 're starting to lose money with their style of allowing people to select their own selections and portions , but i truly feel as if the bowl are getting smaller and smaller each time i come back to this establishment . what the hell is going on genghis ??!! i am truly disappointed ! : -lrb- you ca n't even pour your own sauces anymore . now they have a attended grab your sauces for you . how very much frustrating ! i have never felt so ripped off after spending $ 8.99 for a meal . let alone our waitress was not doing the place any justice for a decent review out of me . . i felt so rushed ! it 's the first time i got to experience the check coming out with the food , without asking for it . what kind of operation are they trying to run here now ?!?! lord please make genghis grill go back to the way they used to do thins , so that way there , i can call it one of my favorite places to eat again !!		1		0
this place sucks . aj 's already pisses me off for being so ridiculously overpriced , but this location is dirty and poorly run to top it off . ok , to be honest , it 's not that dirty or poorly run , but i did once buy a refrigerated package of hummus that already had mold on it . i would probably give this place 3 or 4 stars if not for the prices . the prices are just stupid . the beer selection and salad bar are ok , but again , did i mention how maniachally expensive everything is ? i also do n't cook a lot . so maybe this place is useful if you cook a lot and you need some ingredient you ca n't get anywhere else . but in that case , you 'd still have to be the prince of dubai to be able to afford a lamb chop and a jar of imported chutney -lrb- or whatever people who cook put in their food -rrb- .		1		0

okay , while i love chris and i love his product i despise their group reservation policy . we called weeks ago for a reservation for 9 towards the end of may , they told me that we need to call one month to the date at 5 o'clock . . so today that call was made at 5 o'clock , the stupid matter of factly bitch told me that the reservations were gone at 4:30 . . okay , if you 're going to fuck around with the way you do things that 's one thing , but being a dumb bitch about it is completely another . i think i 'm finally over my love for this place . . i mean 3 weeks ago we showed up and was told the wait was 4.5 hours . . i do n't wait that long for pizza . . while his pizza is great , its just fucking pizza . advice : get a bigger place !! sorry but i 'm still fuming mad !!		1		0
i have not eaten here but fear not the place is closing and they are getting out . . harry does n't know what he 's doing and it shows by the reviews . . the kid is no peter hopefully he will continue to do what he does best which is nothing		1		0

i was recently invited to join the dutch mafia by two really really nice baristas at dutch bros. . coffee . i was concerned that there would be some sort of `` coffee in , coffee out '' ritual that would require my participation , but i was assured that i had nothing to worry about . and that is how i became a card carrying member of this organization . also , this card gives you one free beverage after you purchase 8 , so i would recommend joining the ranks of the dutch mafia . i am not much of a coffee connoisseur , as in i enjoy the instant shit that is provided by my place of business , so you can disregard my opinion . however , i love the coffee at dutch bros. . just a plain old cup of coffee is really tasty . they are also happy -lrb- like really happy , not faking it -rrb- to accommodate any other requests that you have . once i asked for a half coffee half steamed chocolate milk -lrb- delish , bee-tee-dubs -rrb- , and i got just what i wanted . they are even willing to experiment for you too , like the one time i got a kiwi-pineapple italian soda . i highly recommend stopping by for a drink if you ever happen to pass a dutch bros. . if anything the uber nice beverage specialists will restore your faith in a kind-hearted humanity .		5		1
the lovely sarah g decided to bless me w her awesome presence for lunch this afternoon . i am so glad we decided on this lovely house of tricks ! does anyone know why its called that ?!?! i 'm curious please tell me ??!?! soooo this should really be 4.5 stars as everyone has said the service was a bit slow . a lot of places down here in tempe seem that way to me . for some weird reason or another i feel like i enter the twilight zone and the waiters dont seem to have a need for time . maybe they teach this course at asu or maybe everyones just stoned , idk !?!?! the soup of the day was some carrot ginger thing with creme it did not taste like carrots at all whatsoever but it was super delicous and i dont even like ginger haha !! sarah took a pic of the salad i had . i had the best salad ever !!! moroccan fruit and chicken shawarma salad with mango , melon , strawberries , oranges , toasted pine nuts , citrus cous cous and baby field greens with preserved lemon vinaigrette . i substituted the chicken for some tombo ahi it was a few dollars more but oh sooo worth it !! abso-fucking-lutely yum-gasmic !! the chef here is a fucking genius and i will never have enough of this place ... ever ! where is gordon ramsey when you need him to light a fire under your server 's ass to get the tables turned around quicker ?? i will surely bring all out of towner 's here for dinner and do more special occasions here in the future . wine tasting is on tuesdays i better move closer !! so when are we going ?!?!?		5		1
i have a strange fascination with libraries . i guess i just love what they are about . i feel so lucky to have burton barr so close to my home . i especially love that it 's designed by will bruder . you can see the similarities between this building and the asu campus . anyway , besides the beautiful and seamless intertwining of the outdoors with the indoors , this library houses an enormous collection of resources . there are multiple levels with both stairs and elevators to get you around . there is a considerable sized computer lab that allows you to reserve a computer for an hour at a time using your library card . you can find pretty much anything you could be looking for at this library . it has a great selection of everything . we are lucky to have such a cool place downtown . just watch out for the bums camping out in the area .		5		1
it 's time for another update ! julia baker has moved locations to the biltmore fashion park and i am so very happy with their new location ! now not only do they sell their delectable truffles but they also have a cafe complete with mochas , sipping chocolate , and all of julia 's desserts ! the shop has the feel of a parisian cafe and my sweet tooth kicks into gear as soon as i walk inside . during my most recent visit , i had one of the toffee caramel truffles and purchased chocolate covered pretzels for the road . the toffee caramel truffle was beyond delicious . as soon as i bite into the truffle , ooey gooey caramel flowed out . one definitely was not enough ! later in the day , i tried the chocolate covered pretzels and the chocolate is thick and creamy against the pretzel . these are a must purchase as is everything at this store . next time i visit , i will be trying a dessert and a chocolate martini in the cafe !		5		1
i love this place . one of my favorite burger joints . i have been to in n outs before but recently friends have exposed my to the `` secret '' menu . double doubles are great but they are awesome when you get them animal style . 3x3 animal style forget about it . i have died and gone to cheeseburger heaven . also love the fact that this one is close to work and home . such a simple menu , burgers , fries , shakes and drinks but it is when you get into the customization that you find the magic of in n out . animal style burgers , grilled cheese sandwiches , animal style fries , etc. . the combinations expand so much just by adding a few simple things to an already simple menu . the staff is awesome too . no one ever seems to have a bad day and be grumpy . they are always in a great mood . it borders on creepy because everyone who works there is so nice and looks like they are from the 50s . it borders on the stepford wives almost . maybe we are just so used to less than perfect service that when we get great service we do n't know how to handle it . ca n't go wrong with a 3x3 animal style , fries and a chocolate shake . love it . best place ever .		5		1
restaurant was absolutely packed on a thursday night . we found our way to the hostess station and was informed the wait was 90 minutes . normally this would make me crazy and would never consider waiting that long but fortunately the bar was the perfect place to hang out , drink and socialize while waiting . at the 35 minute mark we were offered our table . i guess the idea is to under promise and over deliver . every employee we encountered was friendly and made us feel welcome despite what a madhouse the place was . the remodel is spot on as most of the original building has been transformed . on an unrelated note , beware of the speed trap along gilbert road . we were seated at a street side patio table and watched a motorcycle cop pulling people over , one after the other . the speed limit is 25mph and it seems the gilbert pd takes the speed limit very seriously .		5		1
went here last night to grab drinks with a friend and had a blast . the place was pretty empty in the downstairs bar so the bartender was at our service . i did n't catch his name , but he has a shaved head and makes the best drinks ! the gin gimlet was perfect , not too strong or too sweet . the dirty stoli martini was even better ... oh how i love a good martini ! then he took the reigns with our drinks after that . my friend had a chocolate martini and then something that tasted like a raspberry creamsicle . both were sweet but delicious ! and i had a blueberry lemondrop and an appletini . do n't judge me on the appletini ! i just wanted a green drink ! they were all good and we were in reverse happy hour so we got the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped scallops for $ 5 a plate . they were huge bites for only $ 5 a piece and i loved the sauces that came with it . i 'm coming back for sure , but only if the bartender is there ! i love the drinks ! put anything in a martini glass and i 'm there !		5		1
love the concept of this place . my mom and i have been going for a few years now and always have a blast . we start with fun cocktails at salt . then we go find our seats -lrb- its worth it to pay the extra $ $ for the premium vip seating -rrb- . then we kick off our shoes , order some wine , recline our seats and enjoy . you can also order food there , but we usually go out somewhere else afterwards . obviously i would n't recommend going here every time you go and see a movie but its nice that you can enjoy time out at the movies and really feel like you 've done something special . last time i was there we got free candy served in martini glasses in addition to the free popcorn . sweet !		5		1
favorite place to shop ever ! and there are many many reasons why , but i 'll try to keep it short . i 'll even number them for you , in order of importance . 1 . quite clean - always a plus ! 2 . friendly service - even the employees that do n't speak english very well make every effort to help you find what you need , and they always say hello , and thank you . 3 . inexpensive - they are n't always `` cheap '' , but their prices are often quite low , and very reasonable . 4 . unique - you can get ingredients here you ca n't get from supermarkets or aj 's . need fresh lemongrass ? they have it . need galangal root -lrb- need to even know what it is ? -rrb- ? they have it . need special spices for thai or indian dishes ? they have them . 5 . tea-topia - they have a serious amount of teas available , ranging from whole-leaf to instant with sweetener . they 're delicious , reasonably priced , and delightful . 6 . meat department - their meat department has a really great selection of fish and shellfish . i do n't particularly care for their chicken , but i try really hard to buy free-range chicken anyways . and their fish is fresh , and most often ocean rather than farm raised/caught . 7 . fun - this place is my playground . i have been in a few times , and every time i 've just walked around exploring , reading and being like a kid in a candy shop . if you have a fondness for any kind of asian food , from japanese and chinese to indian or s.e. asian , they have an aisle -lrb- or more -rrb- that will make you burst with excitement and wonder . bottom line - you really really must stop in . it 's worth the trip , and you 'll walk out with a tremendous amount of stuff you did n't know you could find or that even existed , and your bank account will smile at you .		5		1
ca n't get enough of blt steak ! i took my kids to happy hour just so they could enjoy the food . shrimp cocktail is only 3 shrimp , but must be almost equal to 1 lobster tail in size . the shrimp are huge and fresh . the hamachi is delicious , but do n't expect to fill up on it . great mix of flavors and spices . the calamari dish is also a small portion , but has great flavor . another good dish is the short rib sliders . great portion of meat and a favorite lunch dish for my son . the steak tartare is great with the small quail egg . a great mix of meat and acidic flavors . if you need a large dish go with the flat bread dish . 2 types of cheese , balsamic , and arugula . large flat bread cooked on wood . great flavors with the prosciutto . if you like ham you have to try prosciutto . another larger dish is the blt camelback burger . angus beef and great seasoning and ingredients . you have to go during happy hour and eat in the small bar area . only a few tables and the bar , but a great way to experience the food here . the drinks are somewhat inexpensive and i like the camelback ipa . the mojito here is excellent as well .		5		1
my wife and i always enjoyed the food at the place at their previous , smaller location , so we were happy to hear they expanded into a larger restaurant . we were also pleased that they were open for dinner most of the week , so we went in to have breakfast for dinner -lrb- they do have a dinner menu , but they serve breakfast all day , so , heck yeah . -rrb- long story short , i got the steak and eggs breakfast a 12 oz steak , two eggs , hashbrowns , and pancakes . for twelve bucks . i likemy hashbrowns well done and unlike most places , the waitress listened and they were great . the steak was outstanding , i believe it was a sirloin . a 12oz steak for $ 12 bucks ?? you ca n't beat that , i do n't care what it comes with . the staff was great , the restaurant was clean , everything was top notch . i will definitely return .		5		1
this place is addictive and is going to get me into trouble . the wine by the glass list is small but very good , when the food arrives it 's even more interesting and tasty than you expected when you read about it on the menu -lrb- excluding the bruschetta which i found uninteresting -rrb- , but i think the best thing is that this is a great place to hang out for an afternoon . staff are friendly but not in a goofy way , helpful when you need without being condescending and , unlike so many wine bars , professional in appearance and behavior . good people watching with a pretty diverse clientele . i have n't done my usual saturday chores for two weeks now , instead finding excuses to hang out here all afternoon . baaaaaad i prefer this location to the one on campbell because it 's airier and has better service . recommendations ? if you ca n't decide , get the plate which has bits of all kinds of things , all of which are wonderful . try the sparkling sauvignon blanc for a nice change from the typical white wine . and of course try to do so before 5pm to get your wine for $ 5 .		5		1
love the store . its fun going through different departments and getting ideas for your own home . we have tons of stuff from ikea and it does not feel like a college dorm room . i do n't know what the last person is talking about . they actually have pretty cool things . i do n't think i have ever found a label on ikea stuff that says it is made in china . it is always another exotic country . its cool . anyways , the best part about ikea might be a little surprising to you but we love it and it is the fat free yogurt they serve for $ 1 and also their pepsi cola . you can only buy these to go from the deli counter in front of the check out lines . the pepsi tastes sooooo different than the regular stuff you get at fast food joints . i think the formula is swedish . it is yummy . got more zing to it . ikea also has a restaurant upstairs that serves some pretty amazing penne pasta with marinara sauce . it is filling and cheap .		5		1
in two words : variety and healthy . this was my first time here although in the past i 've walked by it loads of time . had to stop for a bite to eat and it did n't disappoint . looking at the menu is overwhelming , a good thing in my book . everything sounds so fancy and delicious . they have a decent-sized breakfast menu . the place serves a mix of american gourmet with italian favorites but with an organic twist . they have , for example , cranberry stuffed turkey sandwiches , egg parmesan sandwiches and a nice looking kale salad . the use of `` soup of the day '' on the menu is redudant because they have a daily choice of 6 yummy sounding soups . the staff is friendly . the place is well lit and cozy . noise level from the mall does n't seem to be a problem in the morning . so what did i order that was so great ? i had the feta frittata , which looked like an egg omelette mixed with eggplant , zuchinni , bell peppers and roma tomatoes . the best part is , of course , the feta cheese ... it came with a generous serving of buttered toast and papas fritas . for a drink , i ordered a chai tea , which is a tad overpriced at 3.95 for a small one . if i talk to my parents about how good this place is , with any luck , i 'll get a gift certificate for christmas .		5		1
every time i go to spain , i have to check out flamenco . the traditional spanish dance is so beautiful and full of spirit , with colorful costumes , energetic music , and emotive singing . while you can catch it weekly at pepin in scottsdale , i was really smitten with a recent flamenco performance i saw at crescent ballroom , which features free flamenco every saturday night from 6-8 p.m. . the performances are done by local flamenco dance troupe flamenco por la vida . when i went , there were two ladies and a guy tearing it up on the small stage at crescent 's lounge area , and they alternated dancing while a guitarist strummed . it was captivating and intimate , and about as close as you can get to an authentic spanish experience . sip on some of crescent 's sangria , and enjoy ! also , besides the awesome flamenco -- i 'm in love with crescent 's food -lrb- the chips and burritos are amazing ! -rrb- , and the sound and atmosphere at the concerts is always high-quality and friendly . it 's an all-in-one amazing place !		5		1
i really adore this place . they 've got some of the best lentil soup around and all of their chicken dishes have been perfectly seasoned and very , very juicy . i recently got the kabob plate and it came out so tender and juicy it was falling apart on my fork . their hummus and garlic sauce are both very good as well and the service is quick and friendly . last time i was in , i noticed they expanded their dining section so the place is a bit bigger now , probably to accommodate the increase in customers from the park-and-ride light rail station right in front of their restaurant . do yourself the favor . if you 're heading on the light rail and feel hunger strike , stop off here and enjoy a nice meal . they have good lunch specials around $ 7.50 for a full plate with meat , hummus , garlic sauce , pita , and tabouli . mmmm !		5		1
wow , where to begin ... very nice ambiance with glass walls to break up the interior sections . we sat in the room to the rear of the piano bar and could hear each other just fine - it was very crowded and i did see groups with kids in the main dining room but we could n't hear them a few feet away . now the food ... the bread basket had a lovely assortment including these fresh baked soft pretzel `` logs '' that i could have eaten all night long . i had the chopped salad , filet -lrb- medium plus -rrb- and gorgonzola mac and cheese . i 'll admit , i 'm a sucker for a chopped salad and this one was exceptional - iceberg , romaine , radicchio , tomato , blue cheese , cucumber , artichoke hearts in a creamy dressing . filet served on a 400 degree platter sizzling in clarified butter - quite possibly the best filet i 've ever had and i used to go into nyc on a regular basis for steak and have had the best the city has to offer -lrb- peter luger , gallagher , delmonico , nick and stef , porter house to name a few -rrb- . mac and cheese was also quite good . my husband had the blue point oysters and declared them as good as any he 's had anywhere -lrb- he grew up on cape cod -rrb- and the atomic horseradish knocked his socks off . he had his filet medium rare and also felt it was one of the best he 's ever had . we shared the scalloped potatoes he ordered and they were absolutely delicious . generous double espresso that had outstanding flavor . for dessert - butter cake topped with iced cream , vanilla whipped cream and peaches / strawberries . let me tell you straight up i 'm not a huge dessert fan , do n't care about iced cream and was n't really interested in trying butter cake ... i can buy a butter pound cake at the grocery store , right ? wrong . this might be the single most delicious cake i 've ever tried . now the service ... our two servers were outstanding . they took their time , explained everything , were attentive and very thoughtful . wine , excellent selection and some great values to be had . cocktails , did n't have one but we did see several tables get the dry ice mixes and i must admit - they looked pretty cool . all of the food i described above and a bottle of wine for under $ 300 with the tip - outstanding for the level of service and quality of food . for anyone that complains about the price - stick to the casual dining chains . attention owners of other `` fine '' steakhouses in the area : make a reservation , bring a pen and paper and start finding out how to really run a steakhouse .		5		1
if you want to watch more than 8 people in any given night make total asses of themselves , indulge in stiff , cheap drinks , compete in a mess of bar athletics , or stand in a corner alone being judgemental , patty 's is the place for you ! i love this bar . sure , i 'm a tad weirded out by it almost every time i cautiously enter but whatever , adventures in bar hopping never hurt anyone . and usually , once i hop into patty 's i 'm there for the long haul . theres a whole slew of randoms here -- some `` scottsdale '' types , some biker types , frat boy types , your grandfather , a homeless pregnant woman ... a melting pot of boozers , all out to have a good time . its an outdoor-but-indoor establishment so those of you who are out to destroy your lungs and my evening by puffing on newports all night , youre free to do so here , without my complaining . drinks wont break the bank and you can dance your little heart out to a wide range of tunes . leave your snot attitude at the door -lrb- or dont , most patrons here are too drunk to care about your choos getting stained by their spilling red headed slut -rrb- , pattys isnt the cleanest or most trendy spot in old town . which makes it one you simply cant pass up .		5		1
this place is awesome for a healthy and delicious lunch ! prices are reasonable for how good and fresh the food is , and i find the portions to be spot on . the danish salad is out of this world yummy ! i do n't really like the dressing but that 's really easy to get on the side . the dates , currants , apple , blue cheese , almond combo is killer and delicious . the salads are definitely good-sized , but i like to get a carb-based side to go with it to make it truly filling . the $ 1.50 quinoa side hits the spot . highly recommend having lunch here ! parking on the street can be impossible during the work week , but there is a large parking garage just a block away .		5		1
wow , after reading mixed reviews i wasnt sure what to expect . we went here for dinner and drinks before a show at the dodge theatre . it was packed , but luckily we found a seat . it seemed to be understaffed for such a large crowd , but the waitress was great . the food was even better . my girl got the fish n chips and i had the shepards pie . very conventional irish fare and a safe bet . for $ 8 an entree the food was amazing . the beers were cheap , tasty and always full . the atmosphere was a typical irish pub , being loud and lively . this place is great and will only get more crowded as soon as the light rail opens . they also have a great whiskey selection and great decorations . fyi this place is perfect before any major event downtown .		5		1
i have been to cookiez on mill many times and my only regret is not trying it sooner . cookiez has a wide variety of desserts , including italian ice , milk shakes , ice cream , fresh lemonade , and fruit smoothies . while all of its desserts are excellent , the shop is most famous for its ice cream cookie sandwiches . a sandwich entails the combination of one or two large cookies -lrb- ~ 4-inch diameter -rrb- and 2-3 scoops of ice cream . these massive sandwiches come in half -lrb- one cookie cut in half , with ice cream between each half -rrb- or whole -lrb- two cookies , one on top and one on bottom -rrb- sizes and are great for sharing . you can choose any of the several available cookie and ice cream options to make your own custom dessert . i recommend the combination of a white chocolate chip almond cookie with mint chocolate chip ice cream . the prices are quite low . a discount is also offered to asu students and people who work on mill . the owner is very friendly and always in a good mood . pass on by the chain stores and stop in to cookiez . you wo n't regret it .		5		1
definitely some of the best espresso in all of scottsdale . my heart belongs to lux , in central phoenix , but this is sooooooo much closer/convenient ! it has the feel of some of my favorite coffee places in nyc , with that indie/hipster vibe , but seriously high quality espresso . i did n't remember to ask what brand of beans they use , but i know it must be something good because this is some seriously smooth espresso ! i got a soy latte , and just like all of the best places , it 's one double-shot , no matter what size you order . i do like that they have a 16oz size just for the people used to ordering a big drink , though . i opted for the 12 oz size and , despite the fact that it was quite warm outside and i was loving indulging in iced beverages while i was back in az , i knew that to really get the purest taste , it was best to go with a hot drink . the owner -lrb- ? -rrb- was also the barista and the cashier . love that . he was happy to talk to me about the store , and how they had another location over at city north -lrb- that place is still around ? -rrb- before this one . i used to work at a restaurant in the scottsdale quarter before any other shops opened up , and if this place was here then , i would have definitely been spending a lot of money here ! i do n't understand why someone would go to starbucks , or coffee bean , or even coffee planation or jolta java -lrb- i support the local places but come on , get some higher quality beans if you want me to come back ! -rrb- when this place is so much better ! it 's a perfect place to grab a latte while you 're shopping or if you need a little resting spot because your arms are sore from carrying those shopping bags full of new clothes . bonus : they have a discount on baked goods after a certain time -lrb- like 3 or 4pm i think ? -rrb- . great for an afternoon pick-me-up !		5		1
one day , about three years ago , i wanted some fries . i wanted them badly . after a while on the internet i found that joe 's farm grill supposedly had the best fries in town , so i went , expecting nothing more than some good fries . what i got , was an almost religious experience . i am now a convert to whatever this joe guy is selling . joe 's farm grill is so grand , in fact , that i find it kind of hard to review . a delicious , locally owned restaurant that was featured on food network attached to a beautiful farm where they grow their vegetables , plus an award winning cupcake/coffee shop and some of the coolest bathrooms i 've ever seen . i could write three pages on it ! but i 'll make it simple , because there are plenty other reviews to look through . i have never had anything less than great here , whether you 're looking for a burger and fries or some ahi tuna , joes is here for you like a charismatic cult leader . if you have n't stopped by joes , punch yourself in the face , then head on out .		5		1
after eating about the city for about a year and a half , i ca n't find a restaurant more divine than cibo . the setting is key . carved into an old house , cibo offers a stellar patio from october to march where giant trees studded with lights and providing a seductive canopy create a romantic or intimate setting -lrb- depending on who you are dining with -rrb- . inside small two or four seat tables nestled into every nook and cranny of the adorable former house provide the same feeling as the outside but with a few dashes of warmth and cozy . now comes the food . i feel in love with prosciutto at cibo . i rediscovered why i loved pepperoni here . i remember each time i come just how perfect pizza can be . i have had about 7 different pizzas here . the one with arugula on top is delicious . the one with just cheese -lrb- 4 delectable kinds -rrb- and spicy salami is delicious . the one with walnuts is delicious . i could go on and on . perfect for a date . perfect for an out of towner . perfect for a birthday . perfect for any occasion .		5		1
* this review is for a tuesday evening * made my first visit tonight with some co-workers , and everything i had heard about 5th & wine was true . clean , unique establishment w / good service and great ambience . their bbq wings came highly recommended , and i 'm not a big wings guy , but goddamn ... they were amazing : flavorful , meaty wings that seemed to be cooked perfectly . i seriously could n't get enough of them . their garlic fries were also great , as was my caesar salad . my stella came out with a nice ice cold pint glass . they have a pretty extensive food and wine menu , but not overwhelming . their elk burger caught my eye while scanning the menu , so i have a good reason to go back .		5		1
i love the scottsdale greenbelt ! i 've lived in old town scottsdale for 6 years now , and i truly love our community . the scottsdale greenbelt is a fixture which represents how beautiful and peaceful it is here . there are many great people who enjoy it on a regular basis , and i always enjoy meeting friendly people . i 'm a professional dog walker , so i walk the greenbelt nearly every day . if you see me , feel free to say hello . i do n't bite , and neither do the dogs i walk . people rollerblade , dog walk , ride bikes , skateboard , run , play disc golf , etc. ... there is so much to do here and i appreciate it very much . sorry if i sound a little cheesy , i 'm just passionate about our community . cons - there are many homeless people who camp out around the greenbelt area as it runs into tempe . be careful . not sure what the politically correct terminology is anymore , bums ? transients ? homeless ? i 've heard of a few muggings at night . anyway , if you spend a lot of time on the greenbelt you will run into them . once , while dogwalking , i saw a guy showering in the sprinklers .		5		1
this is absolutely as good as it gets wrt views of phoenix . smp absolutely deserves all 5 stars and then some . this happens to be the only 5 star place i can write about that i can say , i 've never driven all the way to the location . haha , it 's because i 'm terrified of driving up that narrow winding road . oh boy , talk about scary . i love to take all of my out of town guest here . well , as far as just before the road begins the ascent , then i notify the passenger -lrb- s -rrb- that someone else needs to drive the rest of the way up to the top ! haha ! great hostess , right ? oh well , you can take central ave south as far as it goes , and you will be at the top of phoenix ! if you 're squeamish , i recommend hiking up there or riding . now , i 've hiked south mountain . my favorite hike was the national trail trek last year . what fun was that ! this is one of the best organized hiking events i 've attended . google this event and get on their email list . you must register for this event the day it opens or you wo n't get in . this is one of the most beautiful hikes . the national trail runs along the top of the ridge and the views of phoenix are stunning . the national trail is about 15 miles long . not the typical out and back length , but there are several smaller trails that you can hook on to the national trail to do a portion of it . i 've done trail running along some of the trails on south mountain as well . i usually enter from the ahwahtukee side for the trail running . there are always a lot of people out there doing various things . i see people cycling . iv ' e even seen a group of guys headed straight down in what i called a death wish on a very rocky side of the mountain . i 've also seen horses on the mountain . not for me , but maybe for you ! for the novice , i recommend preparing well for your visit to the mountain by bringing water , proper clothing . people actually get lost over there . which is quite strange , but it happens . do n't underestimate proper preparation . good luck ! you will love it .		5		1
yelpers get it right again ! the so and i decided on salad and pizza before settling in for a night of disk 1 , season 3 of weeds . so we head over to pizza a metro after a quick yelp search and cruise through the `` wes-side '' of phoenix . pulled up to a mini-strip mall with a circle k and a unisex hair salon which created great interest for us because we love `` off the beaten path '' kind of places . we step in , notice a very clean interior with a very nice staff too-boot . take a gander at the menu and decide on the antipasto della casa for starters and the frescolina fresh pizza . as we 're waiting for our antipasto , we 're served warm flat bread and a spread that appeared to be onions , olives , and peppers . it was great ! we were again greeting by the owner who exchanges small talk throughout our night adding to our great evening out . the antipasto was an amazing array of olives , peppers , basil , fresh mozzarella , prosciutto , and eggplant . it was almost too pretty to eat and more than enough for the two of us . next was the frescolina pizza . man this was one killer pizza ! tomato , mozzarella , prosciutto , and arugula , the perfect layer of flavor . the sweetness of the sauce , saltiness of the prosciutto , and the peppery/bitterness of the arugula made for a perfect blend . wait , the crust ! this crust was beyond real and there were no ends left on our plates . now that 's great crust ! so we both agreed this was one hell-of-a place and we are going to be making our way through the menu along with our standing date with our next in queue netflix-flick !		5		1
news of elements `` rebirth '' has been blowing up my inbox for the past several weeks . so , somewhere , there is a pr person doing a great job of getting the word out . the service was top notch , from start to finish . we checked in early and told the hostess we planned to meet friends in jade bar for drinks . about 30 minutes later -lrb- exactly at our reservation time -rrb- , she found us there and let us know they were ready . she made it clear that we could take our time and that the table would be waiting for us . fantastic ! our server , mark , made an equally good impression on us . as we were curious , he gave us a complete rundown on the multi-million dollar renovation to the kitchen and restaurant . he quickly delivered our requested glasses of wine and took our appetizer orders . when we told him that we wanted to take a quick tour of their deck , he offered to hold our appetizer orders until we got back . he further surprised us by finding us on the deck several minutes later to tell us the appetizers were nearly ready . as we made our way back to the table , our appetizers were being whisked in . way to go above and beyond , mark . your commitment to our total experience was top notch ! the appetizers were great . escargot dumplings , a fois gras mouse and roasted peppers were all extremely tasty . my only disappointment was the fois gras mouse , in that it was a bit light for my taste . the fois gras flavor could have been a bit more present than it was . dinner was fantastic . i had the short rib raviolis , which were wonderful and the samples i had from the other plates around the table were equally delicious . all in all , a wonderful meal , made even more special by our company and by the attentive service we received from all of the staff we interacted with . if this is the `` rebirth '' of elements , i 'm looking forward to a long & fruitful life for this valley gem .		5		1
this resturant is part of the ranch market that it is attached too . i have been wanting to dine here for sometime , and finally got a chance to roll in and dine here . for starters , this is as authentic as it gets . there is a courtyard area with outdoor seating and shopping . colorful , traditional hispanic/latino/mexican culture shows here , and you feel like you 've been taken to another country when you walk in . colorful is an understatement . rich deep colors run through this location , along with beautiful traditions of hispanic culure can not help but to seep into your bloodstream . in the courtyard area , there is a grill that the staff cooks on . women are in traditional hispanic clothing , and look beautiful while they cook . so much fun to watch , as they make tortillas , chicken , etc and be taken in by the action at the grill . as you enter the location , you are greeted by the hostess , and taken to your seat . beautifully decorated dining area , with a bar area , solid wood seating for parties of any size . servers are all dressed again in the traditonal latino dresses , and while i was there on a saturday night , there was also a mariachi type band playing . they have a good selection of food , from enchiladas , burritos and fajitas to mararitas and salsa . i ordered the shredded beef burrito . the serving was ginormous , and hot when the food came out . even though we were seated immediately , there was two large parties dining ahead of us , so we had somewhat of a wait for our food to arrive . thats okay , because we were so entertained with the mariachi band , it passed by quickly . the food was delicious ! portions were huge , and i took home enough leftovers for a full meal the next day . you will not go hungry while dining here , and the atmosphere is contagous . you can not help but to get caught up in the moment , with the beautiful colors , music , and lively atmosphere at this place . i reccomend this place for everyone , as i think its one of the more `` one of a kind '' establishments in this town . you can not help but to have a good time while eating here . an amazing place for locals and visitors alike .		5		1
love , love , love a taste of the caribbean ! the braised oxtails are heavenly , succulent and fall off the bone tender . they had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal . the plantains and braised cabbage on the side were perfect sides , and the rice with pigeon peas was perfect for sopping up all that oxtail sauce . the jerk chicken was also fantastic , but since i was so busy hoarding my oxtails i did n't get to try much of it . the jerk was smoky , spicy , and highlighted the chicken instead of overpowering it . same sides , so at least we did n't have to fight over those . make sure to try the hibiscus flower drink -lrb- sorrel -rrb- with cloves floating in it . it accompanies the earthy , spicy flavor palate of the meat well and is very similar to the jicama offered up at mexican joints . the atmosphere of this place is wonderfully warm and inviting . the eclectic and bold paint decorating the walls is very reminiscent of the caribbean , and the faux-rattan chairs help with the vibe too . there 's also a couch against one side of the restaurant that is kind of out of place , but who am i to judge decor ? nothing in my house matches . in that respect it 's kind of like being invited over to a friend 's house for dinner and having her mom whoop up some of the most amazing ethnic food you never get at your kraft mac n cheese house . it 's clearly a family owned joint with all ages bumming around the kitchen . kiddos bring out water , adolescents with hip hop ring tones take your order , and the matriarchs keep them all in line . it 's energetic and engaging and utterly delicious . next time i need leave room for the cassava or coconut cake ! -lrb- much harder to do than you may think . trust me . -rrb- oh , they also have some interesting breakfast options like smoked fish and such . do n't worry , they also have regular old eggs on the menu . check it out one morning for something outside of the norm !		5		1
this place is unique and has a super cool vibe . the owner is from cornwall , england , accent and all , and seems like a real nice guy , working the ovens with the rest of the employees . the place is long and thin , and pretty small . if you sit at the bar that looks right into the kitchen , do not sit in front of the oven - every time they open the doors you get a blast of hot air . they used to do $ 3 irish car bombs all the time , but not sure if they still do . a great little date place if you want someplace unique to share an intimate drink . the pasties are huge and totally filling , though . so if you plan on doing anything after , be wary of eating the whole thing .		5		1
finally ! i was able to have the chino bandido experience ! i have been wanting to eat here for a while . i just happened to be in the area , so i had to stopped by this historic place ! first , when you walk in , you have the wall !! all of the press clippings , picture of guy , and awards ! basically just bragging about yourself ! hey ! if you 're good enough , then you can back it up ! and chino bandido can back it up ! after you read all of the bragging rights on the wall , you walk in to the order area with a deer in front of the headlights look ! they already know , they will direct you to their tasting station . give you samples of their food . after you got a taste of their menu , the planning begins ! i ordered : jerk rice , cuban black beans , jen red pork , and chinese bbq pork . now you have an option . you can have this plain ! everything on the plate , or in a burrito , or in a quesadilla ! i chose the quesadilla way . now , i 'm not going to lie ! i had my thoughts about this ! fusing two kinds of food this way ? and better yet , two of the most fattening foods ? before i get into details about their food , i wanted to say that their cuban black beans is the best ! and i have had good black beans , heck my father in-law was from cuba ! my jen red pork was in a quesadilla , and that was amazing . then the mixture of the jerk fried rice , black beans , and the chinese bbq pork ! i did not expect this , this was one of the best place i have ever had ! boy am i glad i do not live near by ! -lrb- i would be in a lot of trouble ! -rrb- their dining room is spacious , nothing special , but not needed . i had a great experience here . not saying that everyone would like it . remember , we all have a different taste . but looking at their reviews , it looks like they are doing really well .		5		1
mido sushi ! i ca n't believe i have n't already written a review about my favorite `` discounted and very affordable `` sushi place . where else can you go during happy hour -lrb- which is pretty much all day until 7 pm -rrb- and get a california roll , unlimited edamame , a sesame salad , iced tea and a delicious bowl of ice cream for under $ 10 ? my `` bestie '' -lrb- hi , dana -rrb- and i like to go for our monthly -lrb- sometimes bi-monthly -rrb- visit to mido . we like to sit at the sushi bar and be entertained by `` pancho '' and his sidekick . he cracks jokes and speaks spanish -lrb- go figure -rrb- to us while we pig out on the `` all-you-can-eat '' special with all their freebies . $ 26 bucks -lrb- after tip -rrb- and we have to roll our overstuffed selves back to the car . excuse me now while i add this to my reviews list of `` places i like to go with or without friends '' .		5		1
wow yummy does n't begin to describe the feelings my taste buds conveyed to me . i was one of a just a few people invited to try out food at the fez foodie event by the infamous thomas . okay maybe he invited more than a few people , but i sure felt special tonight as we tried raspberry salad with blue cheese , white balsamic and lovely little raspberries . so delish . my husband , yes the noble plus one , ate not only the special flat iron steak with red smashed potatoes , he also ordered a fez burger as well which he pronounced the best thing ever . yes he can eat alot . who knew the fez burger would come with so many lovely tastes at once and even snuck in . . pears ? so good , no wonder jim w. is rumored to have eaten one everyday this week . we also enjoyed the cheescake , i had to yell at my husband not to eat the whole thing , the ideas was to share a piece of cheesecake not leave one bite for the wife . drinks were nice my `` special drink '' was vodka-ey and citrusey but i ca n't quite remember the name . my friend monica -lrb- she won the magnum opus of wine -rrb- had a great martini drink with red stuff that tasted so yummy . and it had a gummy worm , how cute ! we loved the decor , feel and fun of fez and are already planning our next trip back . thanks again thomas .		5		1
the delux burger , cooked medium-rare , is the best burger i have ever had . anywhere . ever . if free-range fresh organic sirloin is n't enough , they mix in gruyere and gorgonzola , and top the thing with caramelized onions , bacon and arugula ! the plate comes with beautiful little grated curls of carrot and beet-root which are tasty atop the burger . do n't be a weenie and order a plain burger ! order the delux . medium rare . ask for extra chile aioli , you will want it for the sweet potato fries , trust me ! the sweet potato fries are delicious , but i only order them to share because i am pretty sure this is a half pound burger and the fries for me alone are way too much food . the beet salad is also very good . order the delux burger ! chimay on tap , so this could get spendy folks . this ai n't mcdonalds . the place can get annoyingly crowded and loud . it is very popular . try to get an outside table if you can .		5		1
me and my lady friend went here for dinner last night . we were a little underdressed but no one seemed to mind . we were promptly greeted and seated . even though this was our first time dinning here , the waitstaff made us feel like we were regulars . the food was amazing . the fried calamari was cooked perfectly and paired with a great tasting spicy marinara . the salads were average but good , and the entrees really stood out . i had the veal marsala , which was off the charts . after 35 years these guys know how to cook veal . it was pounded very thin and melted in my mouth . the lady had the salmon , which was parmesean crusted and very good . it was mild and wonderful . the tiramisu for dessert was also great . next time though i will get the pasta as the were making it fresh in the restauraunt . i have to give that a try . the ambiance was great . i do n't think they have changed anything since it opened in 1974 . it 's not trendy or chic but it is classy and takes you back in time . it does seem like it attracts an older generation , but if more people try this food they will flock there in droves . i can not wait to go back .		5		1
yogurtland is my favorite frozen yogurt place . they always have great yogurt choices and they have the best toppings ! i love coming here for a nice treat . their bowls are big and you can take whatever you do n't eat home . i usually scarf mine but that 's because i love yogurt !! the only negative is the parking can be limited depending on the time of day you go . other than that , it 's a nice place with great yogurt . i even like their water with the strawberries , which is complimentary . expect to pay around $ 5 - $ 10 for yogurt , depending on how much you put in your bowl . not really cheap but definitely delicious !		5		1
so i had heard of oregano 's before , and know it 's a smaller chain in the valley . that said , when told we would be going here i was n't suuuper excited . i 'd never been to one , but had heard they were a pretty good place for italian . we went to this location because it was on the way home from the aeropuerto . as we drove up , i did n't even recognize it as being a chain-type place because it looked unique . it was jammin inside , so we ended up grabbing bar seats and ordering an appetizer to kill time and hunger . once we made it to our table , we each got a different pasta dish and shared a little to sample other plates . i had the baked ziti , which was amazing . the 2 other dishes i sampled were great too ! great dishes , and nice , large portions ... which creates more meals for the next day . service was great at both the bar and our table . i loved this location -lrb- felt like a mom & pop place -rrb- , and it even has a good size outdoor patio w / heat lamps . i 'm a fan !		5		1
so thomas gets bored , or whatever , and decides to do another foodies event just for yelpers . timing wise it crossed over in to the 5-8 pm time for their regular foodies event . the end result is a bunch of us get to enjoy his hospitality and some special items not on the regular menu . i also got the chance to see some of my yelp friends and meet a few more . i started off with a sam adams summer ale and the first plate of delicious hummus and bread came out , i had to stop at 3 if i was going to keep going . deb and monica had a really tempting order of sweet potato fries that they kept ooing and aahing over but i resisted . then came a spinach salad with raspberries , walnuts , blue cheese and a vinaigrette of some sort . then came the entree of grilled flat iron steak , mashed red skin potatoes and asparagus all covered over in a sauce . to chad 's , our server , credit he described in great detail what was on the plates but i am lucky i remembered the main components . i finished my gluttony off with a slice of cheesecake topped with some sort of sweet stuff . i was sure i was going to need help getting to my car . thank you thomas for throwing another really great uye/foodie gathering ! -lrb- edited after learning some new things -rrb-		5		1
i have been here a few times and it is always excellent . i went today with my dad for his birthday . we always get the guac . get the guac !! it 's so good ... it 's sweet with pomegranate seeds -lrb- i think -rrb- , spicy with jalapeno , and just delicious ... it also has cilantro , avocado -lrb- duh -rrb- , salt , onion ... it 's great ! so i usually get the pollo poblano which is delicious chicken with goat cheese and tomatillo sauce ... yum . but today we wanted to try something else so we tried the cochinita pibil at the waiter 's recommendation . i am so glad we did ! it is slow roasted pork that is roasted for 12 hours ... it just fall apart and yet is so juicy ... it was delicious . it came with spicy mashed potatoes and zucchini . it was all delicious . the pork came with little tortillas to wrap it in and then i put the guac on top ... whoa . delicious . i will continue to go to this restaurant because although it is expensive ... it is so worth it !		5		1
this was the 2nd mastro 's i 've been to in the city . my 1st experience was with their pinnacle peak location . i was curious to see if the quality of the food and experience would hold up ... and yes it did ! we joined a group of friends here for dinner and they accommodated 10 of us near the bar area . we were able to enjoy the live music throughout dinner . of course , i had to order my fav dishes here : wedge salad bone-in filet gorgonzola mac 'n cheese the food was phenomenal , just like the other location . the wedge salad is fresh and crisp ... very refreshing . the bone-in filet is simply out of this world ... the bone just adds so much flavor to it ... yum ! the gorgonzola mac 'n cheese is addicting and is worth the nuclear explosion of calories ... i just ca n't say no to ordering it . the service is outstanding and we were well taken care of . our party of 10 felt like we were at home because we were so comfortable and did n't have to worry about anything all night . we put away 5 bottles of wine and the server ensured that we did n't have an empty glass until we were ready . tip : the food prices are not cheap here ... if you ca n't fade a large dinner bill , i do n't recommend coming here . ca n't wait for the next time ! return factor - 100 %		5		1
i love four peaks as a restaurant , but not as a drinking destination . i 'm not sure why - the beers are great , i 've sworn off the kiltlifter but really enjoy the 8th st ale and an occasional peach . i think it just seems sooo laid back that i get sleepy after all the heavy food and beer . most of the seating is outside , although they 've opened a big area by the casks . this is basically a huge , brink warehouse , and it 's not air condidtioned , even in the summer . it 's more like a swamp cooler feel and lots and lots of fans , so be wary of a summer venture - it may feel a little stick y and uncomfortable in there . there 's tons of tvs , though the mentality and atmosphere is far from a sports bar . there is also a pool table or two . i highly recommend this place for brunch on sundays ... they have their special mamosas -lrb- peach beer and champagne -rrb- and an awesome breakfast menu . it 's hidden back from the main street and in the neighborhood , which i really like .		5		1
i love mojo ! this was my first time at mojo and it was great . i love that you can help yourself and sample whatever flavor you want . i could n't believe how each flavor tasted exactly like the flavor it was supposed to be . the chocolate cake tasted exactly like chocolate cake , the mango was an exact mango , the snauzberry tasted like a snauzberry . we decided on a combo flavor and did `` skinny raspberry '' and `` white boy vanilla '' with just a tiny bit of kit kat . it was soooo good . the raspberry was really tart and refreshing and the vanilla was a great compliment . this is a great place for kids or couples on a date . i ca n't wait to go back . if you go , do n't forget to ask for a punch card !		5		1
then there are those times in your life when you want to impress someone . my friend of many years , sb was in town , and i had just one night with her . she let me pick a place for dinner , so i said to myself , `` what better place than fez ? '' last time i reviewed this place , i popped in for a late night hummus snack , but i have since been in a few times for drinks -lrb- get the g spot -rrb- , and food . my recommendation is to get the fez burger !! this thing will change your life . i say that all the time , but i truly mean it . the ciabatta , the cinammon pears , the aioli ... everything about it screams sex on a plate . as always , the staff was fab . if you bring a lady , encourage her to bring a sweater . my friend got cold , even though it was 104 outside . it 's ok though . totally worth it . if you are in the mood for an interesting experience , sit at the bar and people watch . trust me . it 's awesome and very entertaining . fez , you are one of my most favorite things about phoenix . every out of towner , and every local should be a regular here . foodie heaven !		5		1
i lived on an organic farm for a few weeks in peru a while back . the best thing about it was the food . the fruits and vegetables were freshly plucked from the ground just minutes before we washed it and cooked it up . each bite embodied the words `` fresh '' and `` nutritious '' and filled me with a type of satisfaction i could n't put into words , but it made me feel healthy and energetic and truly believe in buying local purely because of how quickly it goes from the farm to your fridge , retaining these qualities . queen creek olive mill 's food has the same nutritional goodness . the allure may be in the local products at the grocery -- flavored olives and olive oils , freshly baked breads , spreads , fresh cupcakes , etc. . i argue that the food is its winning selling point . i savored each bite of the eggs benedict as if it were my last meal , and the vanilla bean waffle is fluffy and perfect , topped with maple syrup that made me drool . good thing i was sitting outside - i do n't think anyone noticed . my friends and i sat at the picnic tables out in the lawn area , and even after we finished , sat there sipping iced tea and listening to some jazz . it was an absolutely ideal morning . the drive , although far , makes it feel like you 're taking a mini-getaway and forces you to peruse the countryside there . next time i think we 'll make a culinary-adventure day of it when the air gets cooler , and do schnepf farms and the pork shop . we 'll probably need to walk from place to place to build up our appetites , but it sounds delightful ...		5		1
i wanted a simple , yet delicious , wedding cake . we were recommended honeymoon sweets by our venue , so we decided to check them out . they have a variety of different cake flavors , of which you get to taste them all . the designs range from simple -lrb- like mine -rrb- to off-the-wall bonkers insane -lrb- if you 're in to that sort of thang -rrb- . our tasting went well and the lady gave us some good pointers . at first , i was leaning towards cupcakes , but that option provides only one cupcake person , wheras a cake will lead to second helpings & possibly leftovers . good to know ! we went with chocolate mousse and amaretto filling . the amaretto is so -lrb- mouthwaterringly -rrb- good . my mom also ordered cupcakes from them for the bridal shower , their frosting is so smooth and creamy and the cake ... delicious . totally reccommended .		5		1
who does n't like farm to fork field work , right ? these farmers not only are wise but sharing their bounty with the public has to be rewarding especially with their commitment to a fresh and sustainable philosophy . it 's the weekend and there are families all around . children are playing ball or frisbee with their siblings or their parents , under the dormant pecan trees . adam smith is singing and playing guitar . the sound of music , people chatting and laughing with excited children playing is soothing to the soul . i order an egg salad sandwich $ 9.95 . this house serves baked goods and pastries too . i also purchased a little pecan pie . the organic gardens are attractive but i decided to relax on the grass in the shade leaning up against a pecan tree and enjoy my refreshing iced black tea and meal . can a farm morph into a most alluring and impressive restaurant worthy of the highest accolade a critic can award ? you know it can .		5		1
it 's hard to tell others about this place . at least the people i know . i get one of two responses : `` you order a sandwich at a mexican restaurant ? '' yes , a sandwich . it 's not weird . it 's not even unique . it 's a sandwich . you put turkey on yours . they put ham , hot dog , carne , egg , chorizo , guacamole , mayo , and pico on theirs . okay , maybe it 's unique . at the very least , it 's better than that quesadilla you 're ordering . but go right ahead . more torta for me ! `` sunnyslope ? '' yes , sunnyslope . i do n't shoot meth . i 've never picked up a hooker . yeah , there 's a lot of mexicans . but i 'm mexican , so maybe i should be offended that you pointed it out . no , it 's not scary . you do n't need to lock your car door as badly as you think you do . torta kings , you had me at , `` breaded beef . ''		5		1
so now that i 'm working from home amidst traveling , i have basically turned lux into my makeshift office . i just have to say for the record , that i think their espresso gets better every single time i 'm there . or maybe i just fall in love with it a little more each day ! seriously , shit is good . i used to not be able to focus in here with all the ` scene-y ' stuff -lrb- alluded to in other reviews -rrb- but now i 've found that if i have work to do the noise and the people kind of make me motivated . it can get really dull working at your desk in your house . i like that people hate so much on the mac-using , trendy people in the shop . seriously ? who gives a shit ? unless they are mean to you or talk loudly about the previous nights parliament-smoking , pbr-drinking escapades - do you really care what kind of computer system they use and how skinny their jeans are ? if so , i think it 's time for a little introspection . but maybe i just take personal question to those reviews since i own a mac and am always working there : -rrb- but either way - their pastries are divine , their espresso is excellent , and i have never in all of my visits to lux had a rude , pretentious , too-good , whatever barista . ever . they are really kind to everyone that ive ever watched order a drink . i do get quite pissy however - when people sit down at shared tables and continue to cross , shift , and move themselves inevitably hitting the shared table about 8,000 times and spilling my coffee about 8,000 times . come on folks , shared table ... can i get a little consideration for your fellow coffee drinkers !? the end .		5		1
and then i found this whole foods ! after my horrible tempe experience , i wanted to give another wf a chance before going up to the mayo location -lrb- see my review for that one -rrb- . this pv location is quite nice . it 's definitely in a much nicer area than tempe . as most wf 's , this location is clean both inside and out . the staff is very friendly here . not always the most knowledgable -lrb- i had asked some pretty detailed questions about some of the supplements -rrb- , but they are resourceful . the guy helping me , offered to call other locations for my stuff . very nice of him . after i picked up everything i `` needed '' , i walked over to the prepared food section . everything was spotless , and fresh . excellent work . i bought some food to take home . i also got to sample some of their pizzas . delish ! then , the best part of the store ... the ice cream . it 's not your typical froyo , or gelato that has the consistency of snot . they have the best -lrb- in mine , and most yelpers -rrb- ice cream around : sweet republic . i knew exactly what i wanted , so the guy packed up a pint for me to take home . if you are one of those people that ca n't make a decision on their own like a grownup , then you can sample each of the flavors , while you dilly dally ... the lady in front of me was like that . the ice cream guy was very patient with her , and even kept up a smile the whole time . i said it before in a quick tip , but this is the second best wf in the area -lrb- next to the mayo location -rrb- , but the staff here makes up the difference . well done , whole foods . well done .		5		1
after what seemed like forever , i was on southwest after a 4 month hiatus from arizona . the flight was delayed in atlanta , but the gate crew tried their best to lighten the mood , apologizing constantly and then throwing some jokes around . the flight was packed , yet the flight attendants were friendly and helpful the entire trip . they even walked up and down the aisle with ipads talking to customers and mapping out their connections in phx . as usual , you can get plenty of free snacks and drinks and the attendants are consistently up and down the aisles asking if you need anything . at one point , one of the flight attendants just started singing on the pa . i thought it was hilarious , even though she did n't sing that well . great to have a fun flight home .		5		1
i 've been coming into babbo regularly for a couple years -lrb- i went to the cave creek location before this one opened -rrb- , and have always been completely satisfied . the menu is large , with plenty of pizzas and pastas to choose from . from the pizza menu , it 's hard to choose between the traditional choices like the sicilian or meat-a-ball , and the more interesting varieties like the chicken alfredo with spaghetti baked on top of the pizza - but i think my favorite would have to be the barbecue chicken pizza . on the pasta side of the menu , there are a couple dozen great dishes , but the new three-cheese mac and cheese with bacon and italian sausage may just be the best thing on the menu . service has always been great . everyone is friendly , and there 's a casual atmosphere that makes you feel right at home . there seems to be a lot more `` regulars '' here than most places i go to , which says a lot about a place .		5		1
can i just say wow ! the warm and rustic atmosphere and friendly service invited me even before being seated . i sat at the -lrb- 4 seater -rrb- bar facing the open kitchen and chatted w / cole while i waited on friends . love the open kitchen ! cole was busy shoving entrees into/out of the hearth oven but made me feel like the only customer in the place ... and like the oven was n't a gazillion degrees . now that 's a professional ! i started w / celery and apple soup . sweet , savory and creamy . for entree i had the vegetarian rice bowl that was packed full of flavor and so colorful w / white and purple cauliflower , brussel srouts , black rice and more . i ca n't wait to go back for the pork stew w / cornbread . rumor has it that its reeeealllly good ! oh , and i 'm not a big fan of sticky toffee pudding . but i tried theirs , and now i 'm a cheerleading fan ! bon appetite !		5		1
this is one of my favorite sushi bars in town . ken , the owner is so friendly and his food is so good that we keep going back even though it is a 10 + mile drive . the prices here are fabulous for a sushi restaurant , best prices in town . nice assortment of specials every night , and interesting items show up on the board all the time , he has a friend in the shipping business . we 've had some items here i 've never had at a sushi restaurant , straight from japan , very special indeed , rare shellfish and other delicacies . not a fancy place but nice inside , great prices , good sake selection , good service and wonderful food .		5		1
out of all the wine bars i 've been to in the phoenix area -lrb- not counting divine wine in mesa -rrb- , this is my favorite ! hands down . the people are friendly , the room is spacious , the wine selection is supple & the atmosphere is cozy . the last time i went was after dinner at panino on central . my date and i went into the wine bar to sample a selection . he chose his with cheese . i did not . my wine was incredible . we were able to relax on the couch , continue our conversation while having amazing wine at our fingertips . i was giddy with pleasure . to top it off , the bathroom is unisex ... and sneaky . behind a wall without a handle , you almost have to tipsily stumble into it to find your way . while waiting for an open room -lrb- there are two private bathrooms once you 're inside -rrb- , a couple men profusely apologized . evidently , they thought they were in the wrong bathroom . little did they know . i would go back here in a heartbeat . in fact , i 've been thinking of going soon - it 's a perfect place for a date , since there 's plenty of room to sit and an atmosphere conducive to conversation . forget kaz . try cheuvoront instead .		5		1
yum . this place is awesome . i am glad that everywhere we went before this that night had a long wait because i had been wanting to come here for a while . our server was really nice and gave us some great recommendations . we tried the deep fried deviled eggs which i thought were really good -lrb- definitely an interesting taste , but a good one -rrb- , and they were served with a really good hot sauce aioli . my boyfriend and i both got the short ribs which came highly recommended and they were amazing . yummmm . so tender and great flavor , and the mashed potatoes were great as well . i got a red wine recommended by the server and it was really good too . our friend got the osso bucco which i tried also . it was okay but i did n't like it nearly as much as the short ribs . good ambiance and i will definitely be coming back . the patio looked really nice but it was way too hot on this particular day to sit out there .		5		1
alright , not going to lie . this place kind of took me by surprise . i must have driven by frashers at least a thousand times over the past 7 years that i 've been in az . . never once felt compelled to go in and check it out . then over the holidays earlier in the year , my brother and his family came in town to visit me from nyc . to put it simply , they are very hard to impress or even please for that matter . i love them to pieces but they are the epitome of the park avenue princesses who find flaws with everything !! the phoenician and mary elaines -lrb- back when it was still there -rrb- were incredibly `` sub par . '' i took them to mastros and they acted like i was trying to poison them . then , believe it or not , after taking a suggestion from someone who worked at the hotel , we wound up at frashers . i assumed we were doomed from the second we walked in the door . the interior ? very understated and even had a bit of a bar crowd for the last few minutes of happy hour . not a good start for the upper east siders ... then my brother opens the wine list , sees a bottle of silver oak he usually pays around $ 200 for in the city selling for $ 70 , and decides to give it a shot . and thank the lord we did ! that food was incredible ! and i mean everything ! my filet was absolutely divine ! literally beat the pants off of mastros at a much lower price . my brother and his kids could not believe how good their food was either . it was hilarious . his wife practically could n't speak the entire meal . my nephew ordered some bbq sampler if memory serves , and he killed the entire thing , saying over and over again how it was the `` best chicken , ribs , steak etc that he had ever had in his entire life ! '' much to his mother 's dismay of course : -rrb- anyways , if you want a ridiculously good meal that will completely catch you off guard , go to frashers . great food and great wine at almost half the price of what comparable places in the valley would run you ... what more can you ask for ??		5		1
please stop reading my yelp and go here . now . the food is pretty good , the fries are fried in lard , which may sound disgusting but is ` effing delish . the waitresses are cute little naughty nurses , barely dressed , that will sit and flirt with you no matter how fat n ' ugly you are . they have burgers , fries , coke , beer , a full bar -lrb- ? -rrb- and smokes -lrb- lucky strikes baby -rrb- . this is not a kid friendly place nor is it a good idea to bring the mrs. here for your aniversary dinner . but go , and you shall be rewarded . also if you finish -lrb- or attempt at the very least -rrb- a double , triple or quadruple bypass burger they wheelchair you out to your car . awesomeness ; free of charge .		5		1
so many people have never been to this sacks . it certainly does n't help that there seems to be no parking anywhere near them -lrb- there is , its in front of the business ! -rrb- . it also does n't help that there are almost 3 acres of parking lot separating it from university and it is almost invisible from mill . nonetheless , sacks makes ridiculously good sandwiches . they have the best ingredients -lrb- fresh crisp spinach and sprouts , amazing sauces -rrb- and excellent bread . they also have breakfast , it is wonderful . there `` build your own '' breakfast wrap -lrb- burrito -rrb- is a regular for me . you can always order one of their sandwiches , choose an interesting special -lrb- cold sandwich , hot sandwich , or salad -rrb- , build your own salad , and answer a trivia question for a free drink ! the staff is fun , especially when they are super hung-over at 8:30 in the morning ! call them on the hang over , you 'll usually get an invite to a party . they can be super busy at lunch , they get really efficient then though . the concept is kind of brilliant in its simplicity -lrb- like art -rrb- . no matter what you order , it comes in sack that is the same bag they write your order and name on . they 'll call out your name and leave the bag for you to pick up . you can then eat there or take it wherever you like ! special hint : during the summer they are open 7am until 2pm but are almost never busy so its great to go !		5		1
fez is swell , juuuuust swell . i love taking out-of-towners here or chilling with my local peeps on a friday night . it 's an attractive space filled with all kinds of people . very welcoming and posh without feeling uninviting . the kind of place you could wear that hat in the back of your closet that looked like a good idea in the store . why not ? sure you can pull off a fedora here . the veggie options are spectacular - though my one caveat is that you 'll taste garlic in your mouth for days after eating the hummus plate . worth it . wash it down with a damn good margarita and you 'll be fine . seriously , the margaritas are fabulosos . happy hour and weekend specials are super cheap , and the service is incredibly friendly to boot . alotta good goin on up in here .		5		1
scramble = awesome in my book . met a friend for brunch one day and ordered the santa fe eggs benedict . i am a huge benedict fan and am always in search of the newest most original best eggs benedict and for right now , scramble serves it . the santa fe eggs benedict features jalapeno cornbread , ham , poached eggs and chipotle hollendaise . whoever thought to use jalapeno cornbread -lrb- they are more like sweet corn cakes -rrb- is a fricken genius ! the sweetness of the cornbread / cake cuts through the saltiness of the ham and then there is a slight spiciness from the hollendaise . so many flavors going around in your mouth !!! absolutely spectacular . it came with country potatoes which were decent but i liked eating them with the benedict , together , as one : -rrb- scramble is now one of my breakfast spots due to this one eggs benedict which is the only thing i have tried there . i like the walk up order concept and the modern simple atmosphere works perfectly fine for me . they also allow dogs on the patio which gets me kinda excited to bring one of my little ones -lrb- dogs -rrb- here ! the one bummer is that it is pretty far away from me . the drive from maricopa out to squaw peak which is kinda the general area is about an hour . however , that wont stop me from coming back !		5		1
everything on the menu is under 475 calories ! that itself is a feat let alone making the food taste good and seasons 52 succeeded on all counts . i am use to going out for dinner and realizing that i can only afford to do it friday or sat -lrb- once a week -rrb- because chances are i 'm about to eat 3000 + calories on delicious food at a fine restaurant and i do n't want to get so fat i would require wheel chair access -lrb- no offence people who are actually handicapped or fat due to genetics , i 'm sorry its not your fault -rrb- . so finding a place like this that actually has amazing food that 's healthy is amazing . i had the buffalo burger which was delicious and full of so many flavors as well as the basil and parmesan cheese flat bread , my dining mate i was with had the farmers market vegetable plate which can be described the following ways , adorable , ambrosial , appetizing , choice , dainty , darling , delectable , delightful , delish , distinctive , divine , enjoyable , enticing , exquisite , fit for king , good , gratifying , heavenly , luscious , lush , mellow , mouthwatering , nectarous , nice , palatable , piquant , pleasant , rare , rich , sapid , savory , scrumptious , spicy , sweet , tasteful , tasty , tempting , titillating , toothsome , well-prepared , well-seasoned , yummy . -lrb- yes those are synonyms for delicious -rrb- . the servers were also great and full of valuable and helpful information , our server was madison m. i remember because the servers have business cards which is cool as well as unnecessary -lrb- although now i feel i have to ask for them next time i go in , which is fine because they were great -rrb- . super excited to try the many other menu options as soon as possible !		5		1
i truly have no words . . maybe because im speaking a mix of chinese/spanish/english jibberish upon the exit of this seemingly divey place with an awesome , yet interesting fusion of taste sensation . . this is truly some of the best service i have received in soooo long . . my boyfriend took me here so we could get some fast , cheap , yummy take out for movie nite ... the place was crowded as heckbandidos yo ! my bf has been here a lot . . raves of the place ... new id love it . . and told the cute , friendly girl that i was a newbie to the chi/bando . . she had a line . . and amazingly , she started serving up like 8 samples of the most ordered items ! i loved it ! jade chicken was my favorite ... carnitas a second . . the rice is the bomb ... the black beans remind me of san juan pr type ... and thats authentic ! my sidekick , aka mark , ordered me a quesadilla , something he just does : -- rrb - and they got a bit interesting with it . . adding the jerk chicken to the quesadilla . . that was weird . . but miscomm somewhere , again . . its a different language . . learn it , live it and by all means ... yumyelpeat it !		5		1
good food in a gas station ? it 's true . my husband stopped by here for lunch last week and brought back this amazing barbeque pork sandwich with some of the best shoestring fries i 've ever had . one bite and i was hooked . since then we have been here 2 times and both times the service has been fast and the food delicious . the food is fresh and tasty - for both breakfast and lunch . my husband and i split a breakfast wrap and this was no ordinary wrap . whole wheat tortilla stuffed with scrambled eggs , grilled peppers and onions , jalapeno bacon and cheddar cheese - definitely enough food for two . the second time we went for lunch my husband got the special of the day , fried catfish . my husband devoured it . i tried a bite and it was really good - it was n't fishy tasting and the plating looked really nice . i got the pulled pork sandwich with shoestring fries which came in a basket . i 'd prefer a plate , but this did n't affect the taste ! all their meats are slow smoked and have this great `` campfire '' taste . all items come sans barbeque because they have their own barbeque bar ! you can pick and choose which sauces you want to use . i recommend the low country bbq -lrb- has bacon and peppers -rrb- and the texas chipotle . both are a little sweet but super addictive . even the decor inside is nice and simple . i would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area or just want to try some new bbq .		5		1
excelent falafel - check great hummus - check awesome spanakopita - check ** warning ** beware that veggie does n't always mean good for you . while i normally try to skip the cabs , i just could n't stop stuffing myself with those perfect triangles of warm pita covered with their garlic pepper hummus ; it was just the right amount of spice with a more than right amount of awesome ! i do n't eat falafel too often , but this was definitely the most interesting and tasty falafel i have had . cover it with whatever that creamy sauce was and you 're in vegan junk food heaven ! if you 're wondering how the spanakopita -lrb- spinach pie -rrb- was , you just ca n't go wrong with this option . i was plesantly surprised when the spinach did n't taste like you 're average cafeteria bitter blah , whatever-ness like i was half expecting . they perfectly topped the spinach with fresh feta - which was some of the better feta i 've had in a while . covered with flaky layers of filo dough and baked til perfection -- mmm its so good . olive tree is super authentic with my only regret being that i did n't try the gyro , i have a personal goal to find the valley 's best gyro and have had one at close to 10 - 14 places thus far . for some reason , on my only visit here i was just feeling vegetarian , go figure . : / i do n't imagine i will be back too soon , since i hail from cenpho and this place is like 15 miles away , but it will definitely be a destination if i 'm within a few miles around mealtime ! quoted in weekly yelp newsletter 7-25-2012 : http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=0yymd5auwms-83hardcbza		5		1
hiro is probably the best place to get sushi in the valley area . it is a small , yet high volume restaurant - so if you 're going around the 7-8pm-ish times , be sure to make a reservation as sometimes we see groups waiting in the front for decent periods of time . their nigiri is really the best in arizona . i 've gone to plenty of sushi spots , and none can compare to the quality of hiro 's nigiri . they serve a great portion of fish with the perfect amount rice to go with it . their fish is always fresh and always melts in your mouth . recommendations : yellowtail , salmon , and albacore . i usually do n't wander from my comfort zone when it comes to nigiri , but these never disappoint . now for the rolls . i know that true sushi really does n't include rolls , but , hey . how could you go wrong ? their las vegas roll is amazing . probably the best i 've ever eaten . crunch on the outside , and warm , smoked delicious salmon on the inside with gooey cream cheese ! yum ! be sure to try the crazy roll as well ! it comes in pink wrapping instead of the traditional green seaweed paper . the rolls are also a decent size for what you pay for . one las vegas -lrb- $ 12.95 -rrb- roll is enough to fill me for lunch on a regular day ! their caterpillar rolls and rainbow rolls are also picks that i frequently see when dining there . the service -lrb- and i mean waitresses -rrb- is pretty good . not great , not bad , just good . all they do is pretty much bring you your rolls/nigiri/sashimi whatever and then leave . but nothing to complain about . the sushi chefs are great though ! if you have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar - do so . because you can always make conversation with the chefs who know just about everything about the menu and they are funny and polite . they also give the restaurant an authentic japanese feel because they speak japanese ! other recommendations : the sweet and sour cucumber salad . usually it comes right before the sushi and makes a delicious and light appetizer ! -lrb- they also serve teriyaki chicken and things that are more kid friendly , but i have yet to try them !! -rrb-		5		1
i only had their catered sandwiches and salad before , this is the first time for the real restaurant experience , and i fell in love with it ! it was that good !! oh the bruschetta ! i love them !! every single piece was melted in our mouth ! soft and flavorful ! two of us also shared the ribeye steak -lrb- 14 oz -rrb- , medium rare was done great , along with some sauteed green beans and fingerling potatoes , and our waiter was really nice to split the plate for us . along the wine -lrb- lucky star ? -rrb- , hmmmmm ... and how about some cheesecake for dessert ? i love this night ! excellent service ! i can not wait till next my visit !		5		1
our first visit to the mesa arts center was for the dave koz and friends 10th annual christmas jazz show at the ikeda theatre -lrb- seating for 1588 -rrb- . we had balcony seating with a good view of the stage `` from on high '' but the acoustics were surprisingly good for the cheapest seats . the two hour plus show was nearly non-stop smooth jazz and the singing was the highest caliber . every note could be heard static free and seemed flawless to a novice ear . the performance was high energy and very entertaining but one wonders how the smallest saxophone , that looked like a toy instrument from our vantage point , could be so masterfully played and heard from afar . our only complaint would be the occasional glaring light from the stage but the solution is to simply close one 's eyes . all in all a very enjoyable holiday show with an excellent venue and worth returning in the future to check out the other three theaters .		5		1
yes , folks . this place pretty much rocks . the best way to describe it is that it 's like a really hip study lounge -lrb- from the clue board game -rrb- without the books or the geeks , but with a bar , pool table and jukebox instead . it attracts a central & east phoenix 20-30 something crowd who want a cool low-key place to go , but without the scottsdale scene . the layout of the place is little odd - but not too big , not too small . decent servers , generous mixed drinks , stella on tap , movies in the background -lrb- weird science when i went last -rrb- , killer jukebox and fun crowd really make this place . do n't all run now , do n't want it to get too crowded now ...		5		1
i get the road runner sports catalog in the mail , and was very happy to finally have them finally open up a physical store in the tempe marketplace . from the catalog , i knew they had a wide variety of shoes , clothing , and running accessories , and the store was stuffed full of them . but once you step inside the store you get something that you can not get from ordering online : superior customer service . i was having some foot issues from running and wanted to check to see if maybe it was my shoes . their sales staff was excellent in analyzing my foot , stride , arch , and so forth and were able to recommend a great pair of shoes that have not caused me any problems whatsoever -lrb- that 'll teach me to by running shoes at a nike outlet store -rrb- . they 've got treadmills set up so that you can test out the shoes and a 30-day return policy on the shoes just in case they do n't quite work out for you . for those of you that are avid runners and see yourselves coming to this store often , i 'd recommend joining their vip program . you 'll get discounts both at the store and online and even earn a free pair of shoes too . you ca n't be that . happy running !		5		1
jimmy john 's is my favorite place for subs/sandwiches . we order from here often for our office . today , we had 3 attorney 's working out of our office from out of town and when they asked what would be quick and good for lunch , i jumped up and said jimmy john 's !! so we ordered 4 sandwiches . after 45 minutes , our sandwiches still had not arrived , which is so strange as we always get our orders within 15 minutes of ordering it . the attorney 's had to go back in to their depositions and were a bit angry that they 'd be missing their lunch . i called to find out what the deal was and spoke to the manager , i think his name was ollie ? but i told him of the situation and he accommodated me -lrb- i do n't want to say what because i do n't want people to start abusing the situation -rrb- . but he also apologized profusely and was very genuine . it did n't take me getting irate with him in order for him to make things right , and that , to me , is excellent customer service . you should never have to wait for a customer to get upset in order to make things right . i will continue to keep coming here for our business lunch needs . i have not lost faith in them and it 's thanks to the manager !		5		1
love this place ! i went with my grandma and aunt on a thursday afternoon . the weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside . first i like the layout of this place , very open and airy . there are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs . i actually have been here twice so far . first time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists . the servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka , grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend . the second time we ordered 3 small plates to share , ahi tacos , artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels . all three were heavenly and very reasonably priced . the ahi was fresh and chilled , perfect for a warm day . the artichoke dip was different than any i have had before , gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl . the chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted , even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips . the mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves . buttery and melt in your mouth good , not chewy at all with no grit , to most common problem i find . the broth was so good i let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl , soaking up the juice . my martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table . now on to the staff , all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled . all of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server jennifer . we also met one of the sous chefs , lennie . a charming fellow with stunning blue eyes , my grandmother remarked on them , a playful mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform . he swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket . i do believe he is right , cooked to perfection , slightly crisp on the outside , warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and i believe parmesan cheese . after our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking . rnr is another great place within walking distance from my salon and i am looking forward to trying everything on their menu . if all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 i tried i am in for a treat !		5		1
ordered a number 1 and killed it ... . i have never had chicken and waffles together or been to lo-los ... here is the lo down : great chicken , nice fried chicken with a great tasting flower mix for the fried skin . it tasted fresh and the chicken was nicely cooked . it came out super hot so i had to eat it last . the waffles were fresh and soft . nice scoop of butter on top with maple syrup to drown the butter onto the waffles . the waffles are large , fluffy , soft and delish . get the waffles , had a touch of cinnamon in them as well . i had some sunny side up eggs also and with the fresh onions and shredded cheese on top it really added some addition flavors to my eggs . the crunch of the onions with the soft liquid egg helps add texture . at last the last portion of the number 1 , and my least favorite item was the grits . it is a nice helping of grits , comes in its own bowl with a nice scoop of butter to add flavor . unfortunately the butter does not have salt and the grit lacked salt so the grits was basically flavorless . no worries salt shaker in hand i corrected the lack of salt and enjoyed the grits . i just wished it had more flavor in it . a number one includes all that is listed above and is for someone with a serious appetite . bring your appetite and $ 15 and you will be full of delicious fried chicken , soft and delish waffles , and wonderfully cooked eggs .		5		1
quality !!! ingenious !!! awesomeness !!!! this place needs to get closer to civilization . not that there is n't any in queen creek , but come on , they have more cows than stop lights . despite it being waaaayyyyyy out of the way , for me at least , it is worth it . 100 \ % of the time it is worth the drive . they make their own mozzarella , fresh every day . so of course i have to have the caprese salad . i really like their ruben where the sauerkrat is home made . my brother can not get enough of their meatball sandwich full of tangy red sauce and cheese . if you like ice cream they actually make their own here . different flavors that you can not find anywhere else .		5		1
dear joe the water guy , thank you for your water . thank you for noticing my wobbling legs and suggesting hydration . you may have saved my life today ! i loved this experience ! i prepared myself for kind of a shit show seeing as most of the reviews agree that saturday morning may not be the best time to take on the summit for the first time . i had some issues finding parking as i decided to hike after an intense yoga class which brought me to mcdonald road around 9:45 am . to my surprise it really was not too busy ! i did park a ways away as suggested my my fellow hiking yelpers which allowed me to get up to the mountain as other hikers waited in their hot rides for someone to make it down the mountain . pros : great cardio , amazing view , nice hikers -lrb- mostly tourists ... especially on weekends -rrb- , tips : bring a lot of water . -lrb- i am thinking of investing in one of those backpack water things -rrb- if you see ` joe the water guy ' -lrb- this is literally what he told me his name was -rrb- , say hi . to make life easier , just park down the road and walk the 1/4 mile . this will save you time and will allow you to burn a few extra calories ...		5		1
i stopped by after visiting my mom in the hospital . it was cold and raining , and i needed comfort food . i knew i had heard of this place but could not recall any reviews specifically . as i walked in from the parking area , i laughed and wondered if the side entrance was actually the front door ? that is how it was back in michigan , only salesmen used the front . i walked in and was greeted by the guy behind the bar . then greeted by a waiter . they seemed really nice and inviting but the vibe was way off from what i expected . there was no old lady to greet me or ask how my day was . it was a beautiful decor sort of modern and not a cafe at all . i still loved it though . i ordered the sliders which really should not be called sliders . they were the best mini burgers i have ever had and i love a burger . they were 1/2 inch thick , with caramelized onion and some fancy blue cheese . they were served with mac n cheese too . i will be back to try the regular burger but if you go for happy hour the sliders are only 7 bucks or so .		5		1
t cooks is my favorite happy hour in the area . for reals . i want to go there right now . my boyfriend and i somewhat arrived on accident one night , only to realize that i have been missing the best happy hour ever ! we have been back many times since , and i try to recommend it to all my girlfriends . its part of the palm hotel , so obviously its beautiful , elegant , comfortable and more . they have a lovely inside bar and live music sometimes too . but my favorite spot to sit is the beautiful outside patio , especially now , as the weather here is amazing . so they have super fancy smancy cocktail list , which is all 50 % off during happy hour . they also have awesome discounted appetizers . we had the pretzel bites with cheese and grilled brie . but the best night to go is monday night for mustache monday . they have even more discounted cocktails with names like `` the ron burgundy and fu-manchu '' . also - fake mustaches . so fun ! connie is awesome , she is super cute and has been our server a few times now . always spot on with recommendations and even comped us a few drinks when the service was slow . little did she know that i love t cooks despite anything !		5		1
this is shaved iced on a different level folks . this is not your snow cone ice or your hawaiian ice . this is taiwanese ice . smooth and velvety with infused flavors such as taro , green tea , strawberry , mango , and thai tea . if you never thought it was possible to put those exotic ingredients into ice then you definitely need to come down to check it out . my favorite is taro , i die by the taro , its my usual to go flavor for most desserts/snacks . to take it up another notch , throw in some of these toppings : mochi balls , mango , lychee , cheesecake bites , strawberries , lychee jelly , almond pudding , mango pudding , boba , orea cookies , and kiwi . i know this list seems overwhelming but do your best to see what complements what flavor of ice . but who the heck cares , mix and match however way you want , this is your masterpiece we 're talking about here . but wait , it does n't end there , you also add a glaze : condensed milk , caramel , chocolate , taro condensed milk , green tea condensed milk , and black sesame . imagine the glaze as the icing on the top , it brings everything together . pricing is reasonable for these yummy and refreshing delights . you get three sizes : small , medium or large . each size you get atleast 1 topping and 1 glaze . the ambiance is funky fresh , hip , and urban-esque . the staff are energetic and enthusiastic . stop by and check them out . peace and happy nomming .		5		1
if you like sweet frozen lactose treats , there are two ways to get them . one is to pack your bags and head for the arctic circle , hoping to meet some big eskimo tundra-beast named nukka nukka , latch onto one of her semi-frozen titties when her creepy uncle nanook is n't around , and go hog-shit wild . the other is sweet republic . where you 'll find lacto-centric creations designed for the gods themselves . the food network gods that is . sweet republic has created frozen desserts so sumptuous , they 've actually been featured on the food network 's '' my favorite thing to eat . '' and with good reason . they use madagascar vanilla in their cream , and caramel made from sugar crystals that were once cinderella 's tears . i 'm not a food network god , but i do know a thing or two about frozen treats . and until you 've had a tasty delight from sweet republic , -lrb- or one of nukka nukka 's whale-ishly lactating hooters -rrb- you simply have n't lived .		5		1
i do n't know why i even bother trying to go here . every single time i walk in this place i end up walking right back out . i tried to go there with mark j twice in december and both times we ended up walking out within 120 seconds . lame ! the roosevelt is either too crowded , or there is n't any seating , or it 's filled with hipster douche bags or the service eats a dick . my recent problems with this place include : - inadequate seating - huge waste of space/not laid out well - staff consists of asshats mixed with a few very cool staffers . most of the chicks who work here are cool , but i encountered several dick tard dudes . - why is there a security gaurd/rent a cop here at all times ? he is nice but it is too creepy for comfort . what is this ? the arizona mills mall ? - the suckdom ruined my birthday - mean people giving mean looks hamg out here a lot on the flipside the beer selection is good and i ate here once a looooooooooooooong time ago and i think i thought it was good . i ca n't remember because it was so long ago . i 'd love to eat here again but i ca n't seem to tolerate this place for more than a few minues before i stomp on off and out the front door . do better roosevelt .		2		0
i went here last night . i was soooo excited to finally go to the chicago hamburger co. . i have been driving past that place ever since i was little , but never got to go in . well last night was the night . the hubs and his friend josh have both gone a few times and rave about how awesome it is . i had to go ! well ... it was n't what i expected . i will give them that the service was friendly and we had our food in about 10-15 minutes . they were pretty busy , but it came quick . i got two double meat cheese sliders . i was only able to choke down one . the meat was not good at all , it tasted sour . the buns were really mushy . the grilled onions tasted like they had been made days ago and warmed back up . i pawned off my other burger on the hubs . we all split a couple other things because i wanted to try it all . the cheese fries ... gross . they were soggy ... like the fries tasted soggy before the cheese was ever put on . and the cheese had zero flavor , i wanted to dump salt and pepper all over it to give it some sort of flavor . anything . the frito pie ... now i was way stoked that they had frito pie on the menu . there used to be this hot dog cart in this industrial area that had bomb frito pies and i had n't had one in about 7 years . well , the chili was disgusting . in all my life i have never had chili like the chicago hamburger co. . it tasted like a bag of sugar accidentally got knocked over into the chili as they were making it and they just let it ride . so so sweet ... so un edible . the onion rings ... they were good . nice and crisp . really thin though and the batter they use is n't very special at all . but i would eat them again and be happy . over all ... its mediocre . i would never ask to go back , but if the hubs really wanted to go there for sliders again , i would go and try something different . they have a turkey burger which sounds good . sorry chicago hamburger co i really really wanted to like you .		2		0
i think the concept of amc esplanade 14 is great and the remodel is definitely looking nice but honestly , the last thing i want while i 'm sharing a room with far too many strangers is the smell of someones smokehouse beef and cheddar lingering from behind me for two hours . ca n't we enjoy movies with a drink , red vines , and popcorn anymore ? why do you need a new york strip while you watch prometheus ? i just do n't get it . 3d movie plus a huge meal = vomit . just saying . plus , who wants someone -lrb- servers -rrb- walking back and forth , back and forth , yada yada . . while you are trying to watch a movie ? they do a great job of being quiet , courteous , etc. . but over all the service is just ok . we told our server before we ordered that my boyfriend and i were on a separate check from a friend and he still only brought us one check . super annoying . i say , if you are going to have a menu keep it small . they have tons of drink options that seem like they would be great but again , i doubt i 'll down a margarita in a movie theatre . i promise i 'm not boring . hell , maybe i am . i 'm sure many people will rave about this and go on and on about how great it is to ring your server 5 times during a movie for more food ... god . but this just is n't for me . i 'll go and i 'll bring my own milk duds and red vines . do n't tattle .		2		0
usually at least somewhat busy - this bar has a few things going for it ... for one , it 's got a great location - although it 's a little close to competitor salty senorita . second , it 's got chips and salsa and standard mexi food and the kitchen is `` open late '' -lrb- whatever that means -rrb- . the food is n't so bad - it gets the job done ... but i do n't know that i 'd suggest it for a sit-down meal . maybe it 's good if you 're planning on making it a long night and you want to get some food to keep you going . i do n't know ... the layout of loco is fairly comfortable and casual - although when it 's crowded , it gets difficult to navigate around the small bar to get a drink . when you do get a drink , they are n't weak or terribly expensive . the problem with this bar is that it 's a douche-fest . looking around the room on any given weekend night , you can just go `` douche , douche , douche , plastic , douche , plastic , douche ... '' and you 'll know there 's probably $ 8000 worth of fancy jeans in room . it 's a slightly different crowd from salty 's i think . there are a lot of good looking people there usually , but it 's just not my crowd . maybe i 'm getting too old .		2		0
anytime i say the code word `` bbq '' , my parents are in . so , i called my parents to meet me for dinner on a tuesday night . my take ? not awesome . this surprised me for a couple reasons : 1 -rrb- the lot is always packed when i drive by and 2 -rrb- when i mentioned where i was going , one of my co-workers who had been to another location said we were in for a treat . but , i should have known not to trust a barbecue place that does n't smell like barbecue when you walk in . it took a while for someone to greet us when we walked in the door . i was there , as i mentioned , with my parents . on a weeknight . i expected they would give us a choice of either dining room or the bar . instead , we got a head nod while walking briskly by and a `` find yourself a spot in the bar '' dismissal . we picked a booth near the door . there are 13 flat screen tvs on the walls of the bar . i know this because the the service was so slow , it gave me ample time to count them . repeatedly . when the food arrived , it was mediocre . the ribs ? not terrible . cole slaw ? do n't waste your time . i sampled my dad 's and could n't believe they served it without tasting in the kitchen first . bland starts to describe it . he exchanged it for another side , with similar lackluster results . our server was negligent , busy and disinterested . she asked me if she had brought me the wine i ordered right before she dropped off the bill . when the bill came , my dad -lrb- for the first time in the history of me dining with him -rrb- said `` do n't worry about leaving a good tip , i guarantee you wo n't be back '' . note : i did leave a good tip , but he was right . unless they make a lot changes quickly , i definitely wo n't be back .		2		0
i have to say i was a bit disappointed . i drove 40 minutes out of my way to have one of these great green chile burritos ... i was at least expecting pulled beef , not beef squares . the sauce was decent , had a good kick , but there was wayyy too much of it with no chips to eat it with ? shame on them for no chips and salsa !!!!! for $ 8 there was very little amount of beef inside swimming in green chile sauce-how did they get all that green chile sauce to stay in there !? we ate it on the picnic tables outside in the 107 degree heat while we got bitten by ants . it 's a pretty sketchy neighborhood , so i would make this a lunch time experience if you must try it for yourself . come packin ' some heat if you do n't want to end up like ` boys in da hood ' lol		2		0
did n't care for it . expensive , small portions , and mediocre cooking . go a few blocks west to saigon pho if you want the real thing . but this place is prettier , whatever that 's worth to you .		2		0
arizona mills ? more like arizona smells !!!!! easily a top 3 ghetto mall in the state ! the whole time your here you ca n't help but feel your car will get broken into or someone will rob you . also this mall is crazy dirty ! when you walk in through the movie theatre exit on the side by dave and busters there is some type of metal structure that has more pigeon shit on it than the pigeon ladies clothes in home alone . the food court sucks and there are only about 3 descent stores here . clean this dump up mills !		2		0
this review is not for the food , it 's for the service . i have not had a chance to review until now . it was about 2 months ago on a friday evening . it had been a long week and my daughter and i wanted to grab a bit to eat and then browse the borders next door . i knew there would probably be a wait since it was friday night . we walked in and there we some other parties seated waiting . i went up to the hostess and gave her my name . i asked where the restrooms were and told her we were going to use them and we would be right back . she said `` that 's fine '' . there was another party of 3 ahead of us , a mom and two children , that had been seated there when we walked in . they came in the restroom too and we all came back out at the same time and sat down to wait . they were seated about 5 minutes afterward . i watched the hostess as she folded napkins and did other things at her station . another couple walked in and they were seated immediatly . then another mom and child walked in and were seated . when the hostess came back i told her we had been waiting ang gave her my name again ... this was at least 15 mins later ... . . and she said `` i called your name '' very rudely . i told her we had been in the restroom -lrb- for not more than 5 mins -rrb- and she said `` oh well '' . and then she said well , i guess i can seat you now . this girl was maybe 18 or 19 , tall , thin , pretty , but certainly did not have the brains god gave her ! she was rude and clearly did not pay attention to her job . she was too busy trying to look pretty . the rest of the experience was fine . our server was pleasant and fast . however , on the basis of that hostess ... stay away ! management needs to keep a close eye on these kids . they could take a lesson from the manager at grimaldi 's in chandler ... that manager knows how to keep her staff in check and on the ball ! i wo n't be going back to this particular cpk .		2		0
in two visits to hula 's , i feel it is a strong two star establishment and there are several reasons why i feel this way . food quality seemed good , but menu items i tried were fairly bland and not very interesting , though i do find this holds true at many `` hawaiian '' restaurants . drinks here are stiff and during happy hour you can pick up a nice buzz for very little money , and this is a plus . the restaurant is nicely designed and modern feeling , hence the name modern tiki . televisions here , i 'm assuming , are reserved for 50 year old batman movies , cartoons , and hawaiian videos , since that 's the only thing i 've seen on the screens . i never understand movies in a bar with no sound , they do n't make very good background ambiance as they are designed to be heard and draw you in . if sports were on , it would be great because you can glance up every now and then between conversations and see whats going on . you do n't have to watch a whole plot unfold . my last visit , after a day of mountain biking with a friend on squaw peak , we stopped here for happy hour and sat on the patio . they turned on the fire pit for us and even though we were seated next to it , it provided little warmth . the fire pit did however overwhelm us with the odor of propane burning . oh well . we asked to split the bill , mine card and my friend 's cash . we handed the it to the waitress and i said `` put the remainder on the card '' yet she came back with two separated checks ... both charged to my credit card . i asked why i would want the bill split up on my card and where the cash went . she said she thought it was a tip -lrb- $ 13 when the bill was $ 22 -rrb- and i said no , you were supposed to take the cash off , then put the rest on the card . please refund my card the amount of my friend 's meal , and apply his cash toward that . she argued thats not right and refunded both meals on my card , took the cash , and said we were good to go . i signed the bill but i wonder if i was ever charged . she was doing her business a disservice with her awful , awful , serving skills . on another visit , the bartender spent my entire time there acting like he was too cool to be at work , i was bothering him by making him do his job , and i was n't welcome to sit there . this could be a nice spot if they cleaned up the service problems and added a little oomph to the food . for now , i say it 's a pretty restaurant with good stiff drinks . service and friendliness is half the battle though . unhappy/dumb as rocks staff = unhappy customers .		2		0
we decided to go to rock bottom before a movie . we walked in and were informed that there was a 30 minute wait for a table in the `` dining room '' but that we could opt to sit in the bar area . so we did the latter . there were lots of open booths in the `` dining room '' , which was kind of frustrating , but i know that restaurants have to stagger their tables so the kitchen does n't get overloaded ... but seriously , it 's a big restaurant ... i 've been to rock bottom several times , both in denver and arizona , and i 've never had an overly pleasant experience . during our meal i was reminded why i do n't really go out of my way to eat here . the waitress would disappear for long periods of time , and all the other waitresses would n't make eye contact with anyone other than the diners at their tables . frustrating ... we had the pretzels to start , which were really good . but , in my experience , even microwavable pretzels are delicious ... it came with a side of cheese sauce with some herbs in it ... honestly it tasted like velveeta , cilantro and rotel canned tomatoes . sub-par . i had the steak spinach salad , which was described as `` fresh baby greens with gorgonzola , walnuts , tomatoes and red onion tossed in a balsamic vinegarette '' . the red onion overwhelmed the salad . the tomato was mealy . there was hardly any gorgonzola , and the walnuts were nonexistant . i was bombarded with soggy croutons . rock bottom is just not the place to spend money on food . it 's a bar with a handful of unique beers . yard house is much better if you 're looking for a dining experience/brewery , and it 's closer to the theater . and their spinach salad rocks .		2		0
2.5 stars . borderline 3 . i just was n't impressed . oh , but i wanted to be . i mean , a local brewhouse right down the street from where i live ? i thought for sure this would become my home away from home . instead , it was so mediocre and underwhelming , i ca n't help but wonder , `` will i ever be back ? '' probably not . my friend and i walked into the restaurant side of sonora . i wanted to sit in the den , where the brews are crafted . we were told to cross over the patio to the place next door . alright . so , we did . hardly anyone was there . in fact , the place did n't really pick up until the time we were leaving . must 've been the football game that drew people in , for there was a flat screen plasma tv behind the bar . speaking of bar , i was excited to try their vanilla porter . i was told it was so good , it would make you wan na slap yo ' mama . `` my mama needs a good slappin ' , '' i thought . well , she did n't get it . ok , so maybe vanilla + beer is n't my thing , but i wanted to try something new , something special to this brewhouse . after all , is n't that the point ? the kick and finish of this beer did not impress me . in fact , i struggled a bit to finish my pint , which , was $ 2.75 during happy hour . at the very least , the prices to whet my whistle were great ! my friend and i opted to try the food . i felt brave and ordered the bratwurst . maybe i 'm not a bratwurst person , for it was just okay . nothing else on the menu appealed to me , even though they do tend to have a variety -lrb- fish and chips to grilled salmon to soup and burgers -rrb- . the layout of the place was somewhat unusual . i mean , two seating areas connected by an outdoor patio area -lrb- with heaters -rrb- . that was cool , except that when my friend and i left the den , we had to cross the patio to get to the exit -lrb- in the other building -rrb- . along the way , i got one giant whiff of cigarette smoke . yep , that 's just what i wanted to top off what had become a very bland and unenthusiastic experience .		2		0
overpriced for `` beep-beep-beep '' everything , but some of the table jukeboxes work ! -- omelet was too perfectly formed to be freshly made , ew . where did it come from ? -- they must have silenced the microwaves , or the beeping from the `` kitchen '' would have drowned out the music . -- not much food prepared here , just reheat , serve , and charge a bundle for it the recent availability of mostly-ready-to-serve food provided by shamrock and its local competitors is mostly just scary . do n't have a grill ? no problem , we can make your eggs benedict for you , almost-ready-to-serve . no toaster ? no problem . we can deliver it pre-toasted . -lsb- stepping down ... ok i 'm done now -rsb- i loved being able to select diner tunes from the table 's mini-juke . it worked too ! note : some of the tables ' jukes are possessed by demons and may suddenly start , or not work at all . take your chances when dropping your two-bits . i love the vibe , just not the food . unfortunately , that 's what i go to a restaurant for , the food .		2		0
it looks like i will be the lone naysayer but i was not too impressed with this place . it was my first exploration into salvadorian food so it was the best salvadorian food i have ever had . with that said , the location is a bit hard to find as the parking and entrance are in the rear . we sat down and looked at the menus , which lacked some english descriptions for many items , i can speak enough spanish to know foods but some important details were missing . i opted to try two things i have never had before . yucca and pupusa with cheese and layote . yucca came with some pits of fried meat that i did not even want and my meat-eating friend did not like . the yucca itself was good but not too diff rent than a potato wedge fry , i guess starch is starch . my pupusa was a cheese filled flat pocket i did not even see or taste the other filling . it was a bit runny from the cheese and lacked a firmness i expected . i used the accompanying bottle of hot sauce to add some flavor however , the sauce lacked any real heat . the chips and salsa were decent but nothing special . the prices for the pupusas seemed good at $ 1.75 but the yucca at $ 5 was a bit steep . i will give this place one my try and i will be going with my native spanish speaking friend .		2		0
oh , how i used to love sunup . i was a fan when it was still sonora brewhouse , and i was a fan after the name change/change of ownership/whatever . the waitstaff was always sort of iffy , but the patio was comfortable -lrb- when smokers were n't around -rrb- , and the food was pretty consistent . i was particularly in love with a new addition to the menu - the spicy pulled pork sandwich . in search of a good place open on july 4th , i stopped in with a friend , already craving that delicious sandwich . after waiting a couple minutes to be seated -lrb- and not even being acknowledged by anyone when we entered -rrb- , we were led to a table by an older woman . she took our drink orders and left us with menus to look over . it took me a minute to realize they 'd changed their menu . instead of one with appetizers , salads , sandwiches/burgers , entrees , and desserts , they instead now have a lunch and dinner menu . and , sadly , the pulled pork sandwich had been discontinued . i settled on the green chile chicken sandwich of some sort and an iced tea . the waitress was n't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant . our meals arrived but without the chipotle ketchup we requested . a few minutes later , the waitress brought it to our table . there was nothing impressive about my sandwich . it was fairly blah and unseasoned , and the sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside but tough and hard on the inside . shame i paid $ 1 to upgrade from regular fries . once it came time to pay , the waitress took an exceptionally long time to return our cards and receipts to us . my companion saw she was just standing around in the back not doing anything . the place was pretty empty , so i do n't really know why service was so bad . i do know that the new menu leaves a lot to be desired , and unfortunately , i 'll be hard-pressed to return in the future .		2		0
always heard the advertisements for this place on the radio . was given the impression it was a real hip place to go . well , when you see the outside , the big cadillac and the entrance with all the license plates , you think you 're in for a treat . it 's just a facade . get inside , sit down . you realize they keep the place inside too cold . at least the bathrooms are clean . i ordered the bacon wontons because that was the cheapest thing on the menu ~ $ 8 . when i got it , i was shocked by the small portion . you get used to the taste , but when i was done , i felt a little nauceous . maybe cream cheese and maple syrup is n't the best combination ? for your money and time , go elsewhere .		2		0
i took some great photos , yeah ... but , it 's overpriced and not unique . things i love : the look of the restaurant . love those paper table clothes you can doodle on . the fact that they have an opera trained singer on staff . woah ! amazing things i was n't too stoked about : just seemed like the olive garden with an extra 3 bucks on the top because there 's a working fireplace in the joint . not blown away by the food -lrb- is n't that really what i came for ? -rrb- i mean , it 's clever . it seems like a really cool italian rustica kitchen , so you 're paying for the ambiance . if you 're okay with that , go ... but know that you 're not going to get anything above olive garden quality . sorry : -lrb-		2		0
this place was ok . parking does suck . i do n't understand why they have valet but it was cheap so we used it . a major plus here is their patio . it appears to be bigger than the restaurant and you can play boci ball ! it was over a hundred degrees when i was here celebrating a friend 's engagement and they turned off the misters . why ??? the fans were still going but they did n't help much . i tried some appetizers . the artichoke dip tasted like cream cheese . i though the guac and salsa were better . and the service was so slow . we were here for 2 hours and only had 2 drinks and not by choice . i actually came here during yelp eats week and was never informed that they were participating . we were only given regular menus . after i found out that they were a participating restaurant a couple of days after our visit i asked some of the other people who had been there if they were ever offered the alternative menu and not one person said they had . lame .		2		0
this review started as one about chompie 's at the pv mall . we will never again go to this chompie 's . see below : `` we have been going to the chompie 's on shea for over two years and really enjoyed the hometown ny food and atmosphere . it reminded us of all the good things that you would find at katz 's in lower manhattan . `` okay , so why the setup for another chompie 's location ? well the last few times at the shea location we sat and waited , and waited -lrb- 15 mins or so -rrb- for our waiter to come by and ask us for our drink order . hey , when you 're busy that 's to be understood -- but our waiter was on break most of time and the place was half empty . also , it seems whenever we asked for anything -lrb- pickles , napkins , etc -rrb- our waiter seemed fairly indifferent to us . it happened a few more times on different visits and so we had enough . `` well , our trek in the desert has been rewarded . this chompie 's -lrb- pv mall -rrb- is everything the other one was n't . the wait staff came by immediately and ask about our drinks order & offered suggestions on different menu items . we were thrilled . we did n't realize there was another chompie 's nearby . and the food was great -lrb- just like the one on shea -rrb- ! `` from now on we will shlep the extra 10 minutes to the pv mall location and will try to forget all about the other one over on shea . if you 're into katz 's and some catskill theater then you might enjoy the chompie 's on shea , we did n't ! '' when the wait staff stand around talking while you 're hungry , it 's a real mood kill . so go to chompie 's at the pv mall and enjoy the food and service and feel free tip generously . oh , btw there 's a ton of parking available at pv another difference in their favor . enjoy !		2		0
i had high hopes from this place , i really did . sadly , my new favorite mexican place is not going to be this one . we arrived a little after the dinner rush on sunday and the place was packed . we were seated almost immediately , which was kind of a surprise , considering how full it looked . the waiter eventually ventured over and asked for our drinks . now , to be honest , we were n't really prepared to order yet , but after dropping off some water , we did n't see the waiter again for at least another 7-10 minutes . come on , we were n't ready then , but it does n't take that long to figure out a drink order . on top of that , the drinks did n't show up until the food was coming out . anyway , after that lovely wait for anything beyond a single glass of water , i was pretty thirsty for my drink -lrb- their take on a long island , which turned out just to be ... a long island -lsb- and not a good one , at that -rsb- -rrb- . my companions food , chicken quesadillas came out looking very pretty . my chorizo stuffed chicken medallions ; far less so . to start , my plate had other food debris on it . apparently wiping off the plates as you hand them out is n't a priority . then again , neither is quick turn around because my beans and mashed potato sides had that lovely `` i 've been in the window too long and got cooked '' film on them . yuck . the chicken itself was overcooked and dry , relying too much on the breading and the oily chorizo stuffing to cover for a terminal lack of taste in the chicken . anyway , based on the rave reviews , i 'd consider going back if someone had their heart set on it , but i do n't think this is a place i 'll suggest again .		2		0
went out with some friends , please be advise if you plan on sitting outside make sure you have a flashlight as there are no lights outside and it is had to see or even read the menu . the outside sitting was packed , felt like a sardine . too many tables way too close to others . the food was just okay , nothing great - my chicken was way dry along with the pitas which had no taste . the cucumber saw was good along with the salad . had to wait a while for our waitress , not good to go if the place is busy , service not good . just okay .		2		0
the sunup brewing co. . i have wanted to come here for a bit really friendly staff . but i come to a brewery for good beer and did not find it here.the sampler was ok i ended up enjoying one beer there called the cherry bomb it 's a 9.6 % bomb of goodness i could see it not being a session beer way too easy to drink .		2		0
overrated . i would probably chose it over mcdonald 's or burger king , but i fail to see what makes people go totally apesh * t over this place . the burgers are good , do n't get me wrong , but they 're nothing like what some people make them out to be . and what 's with the lack of condiments ? blasphemy ! oh , and `` spread '' ?!? wtf is this garbage that you 're trying to pass off as an acceptable substitute for the variety of burger toppings that , for reasons i 'm unaware of , are n't available here ? whatever this crap is , it 's nasty . fries are average , and their shakes are ok -lrb- mine was a bit thin and runny -rrb- . reminds me of a low-budget steak 'n' shake , which has much better shakes and a lot more variety on their menu . -lrb- if only i could transplant one of these bad boys from the midwest ... -rrb- again , even after eating here numerous times , i still fail to see how this place could even come close to living up to the hype . sure , the whole `` secret menu '' was a genius marketing gimmick , but this place is mediocrity at best . if i want the best possible `` fast food '' burger , i 'll go to culver 's which is far superior and gives it 's patrons what we deserve ... some freakin ' choices !		2		0
if you 're into dive bars/irish pubs , you 'll love seamus ' . i 'm not . i went with a few friends after the rattlers game , and yeah . . not my scene . but the guys i was with that love that sort of thing , rave about this place .		2		0
i 've been going back and forth as to how many stars this place should get . i finally decided on 2 because i ca n't award 1/2 a star and feel 3 stars is too many . my friends and i visited on a saturday afternoon . we entered and asked if we could sit in the bar area but we would n't be able to sit at the bar because there were too many of us . the hostess was very short and said she would get something for us and be right back , then , she disappeared . when she came back she led us to the furthest table from the bar . not what we wanted or asked for . we decided we were going to ask for a table at the bar and was informed that outside was open seating - this would 've helped when we asked the first time but , whatever . our server was not the sunniest bulb in the box , meaning , she was not friendly . gosh , i hate that and it put me in a bad mood . last time i checked , she was there to help us at her own will , not against it . geesh . we all had a couple drinks and some of us had appetizers . they were good but nothing to write home about . bar food . my favorite part of the evening was when my friends rode the bull . it was entertaining . so , in closing , go to ride the bull and then get the hell out of there . well , maybe stop at the bar and grab a drink first .		2		0
it has been a while since we 've tried somewhere new in downtown . in all honesty , it is difficult to try new places when all of the new places are only open for lunch and i do n't get home until 4pm . that is why we were pleased to see a new place , right down the street , opening up and actually staying open until 8 . the breadfruit is the work of dwayne allen . as far as i can tell , he is a nobody in the restaurant scene which is a nice change of pace for some of the places that are going in downtown . the space is quite inviting . small open lofty area for dining with seating for about 24 people inside . bright green walls and faux-brick interior brightened the area up and contrasted the exposed ducts . i felt like i was at home . there were two tables set up outside as well providing an inviting option in the cooler months but the local foot traffic was a little sketch . the menu is different . there are words that you recognize surrounded by words that you do n't making ordering a bit difficult . most likely , you will go with the word you know and order based on that . my party seemed to have done just that . after a lengthy wait to place and receive our order , our table was full of food . plantain avocado spring roll with seasonal chutney - this overpriced appetizer was a terrible mess of mushy vegetables warmed inside a pastry and layered with mashed mandarin oranges . the group enjoyed ; i was less than impressed and greatly disgusted at the contrast of hot and cold on the plate . escovitch fish and festival - friend got this . she seemed to enjoy it , not finding it to be nearly as spicy as it was made out to seem . the fish seemed like it was cooked well and the escovitch sause was excellent . brown stew chicken - friend got this . he seemed to find it to be skimpy . compared to some of the other dishes , the meat was significantly less existent . there were also some bones in the chicken . jerk shrimp - wife got this . she thought it was good but was suffering from the spice . she is not one to eat spicy food and this was too hot for her . the shrimp were cooked well and had a bit of crisp to them . also , the tails were removed which earned them big bonus points in my book . jerk chicken off the grill - mine . if ever a dam breaks and floods downtown phoenix , i know that we will be safe . the chicken at zoe 's cafe and the breadfruit will save our home by absorbing the water . i could n't imagine drier chicken than at zoe 's before last night but the jerk flavoring added to the bone dry chicken was the perfect storm to absorb any liquid from my body . terrible , simply terrible . realizing that the chicken was n't spicy at all by my standards , i ordered up some more of that escovitch sauce and drenched by chicken in it whereby making it palatable . the chicken was surrounded by an over cooked pineapple slice that was hard and dry , a tiny piece of corn that had such small kernels on it that i actually had to use a knife to cut them off -lrb- something i hate -rrb- . there was also a pile of ital coleslaw which was a combination of sticks and rubbish that traditionally makes it into the bin at most restaurants . hard times call for desperate measures . drinks did include a wonderful selection of `` jamaican soda '' . the ginger beer was great but very sugary . my wife tells me that the pineapple soda was a little strong and could have been a bit subdued . she also complained of the sugaryness of the sodas . in all , breadfruit is a welcome addition to the downtown neighborhood . i was not surrounded by dirty hippies with dreadlocks and the owners were good people . i would recommend that people try it once but i would never suggest it as a place to go for dinner . also , keep in mind that the owner will harass you if you leave even slightly negative reviews of his place on yelp .		2		0
if you are reading this today is your lucky day ! truly . i am an on again off again food snob . maybe reformed . but no . i love fried chicken ! always on the hunt for the tender fried feathered ... unfeathered friend . i have chowed here 4 times expecting it to be orgasmic , wanting to love it . well , i do n't . i have finally decided to post why . i am not from the school of `` one and done '' everybody , well almost everybody when it comes to food get 's a second chance . sometimes even more . i am done with lo-lo 's however . here is the phat skinny . i order the kk 's . it is 3 pieces of chicken with two waffles , grits and cheesy onion eggs . i have a big ass kool-aid , -lrb- wish they had the purple stuff -rrb- and i eat the whole damn meal . the waffles are ok for me , they are not as crisp on the outside as i would like and they are soooo thin . the cheese and onion eggs are great . but c'mon , the fried chicken at a fried chicken joint needs to be out of this world !!! with all fellow yelpers basically saying that it is i feel like i 'm going to be sent off yelp island . fortunately my little sis is a part of yelp so i may get a free pass ... ala second chance ! the fried chicken here tastes like someone broke out some progresso bread crumbs and a big ass bottle of wesson cooking oil and cooked about 100 batches in the same dirty oil . it just had the burnt dirty oil flavor every time . i am not a fan of that . the thighs were pretty descent , the breast was horrible . every time the breast meat is dry , bland and has that off putting oil taste . so , lo-lo ... no-no , get some purple drink-mix and keep that damn bird moist . change the oil more often and i will try again . untill then i will keep creating my own `` ghetto taco '' thats what we call them in new york . a box of churches a bottle of hot sauce and a box of frozen waffles ... with some cream of wheat on the side !!		2		0
when i heard about this place i was really excited because it is hard to find really friendly vegetarian food in tempe . the atmosphere here is great and very sunny . it is in a strip mall which takes away from it a bit , but the inside has a funky feel to it . i always want to like the food , but something is just off every time . the black bean burger is good , but it comes on an untoasted piece of wheat bread that gets all soggy and falls apart . everything else is ok , but why do they do that . it makes it disgusting . put it on a bun like normal people .		2		0
dropped in with a friend on a friday night and it was d-e-a-d ... that 's never a good sign but we figured oh well , we 're here so might as well stay . we grab a table and a waitress comes over pretty quickly to get our order . my friend was hungry so we asked about food but she informed us that the kitchen closed at midnight , it was about 12:08 . that was annoying because i just feel like if your establishment is open until 2:00 you should have the whole thing open until 2:00 am . so once that was discovered we decided we were just gon na finish our drinks and look for somewhere that did serve food . unfortunately at this point our waitress had vanished . we were looking around the whole bar -lrb- which again , was 90 % empty -rrb- and could n't find her anywhere . after a while i finally spot her and made some serious eye contact until she figured out that we needed her . the whole stop there felt like a waste of time and was accompanied by service that , while friendly , was n't present when we needed it .		2		0
mediocrity according to merriam-webster is defined as : main entry : mediocrity pronunciation : \ m-d-ä-kr-t \ function : noun inflected form -lrb- s -rrb- : plural mediocrities date : 1588 1 a : the quality or state of being mediocre b : moderate ability or value i ca n't really add much to it . my last review described the place . i tried the food last night and it was adequate but nothing that would blow my socks off . my friend commented on the inept plating of her meal , she was quite disappointed . and i do n't blame her . the appearance of prepacked salad is disappointing considering the price point . the place is really handsome and i just wish the food complimented it . everything seemed prepackaged and uninspired . i really do not want to see a vacant lot on the corner of the building i live in . so i hope this place is doing ok .		2		0
i love sushi , but try to avoid the ra sushi restaurants . i was invited to meet friends for happy hour , so i thought i would see if anything has changed since i was here last . no . service was mediocre at best , the waiter was inattentive and forget our requests on numerous occasions . the fish , was n't horrible , but definitely nothing to write home about . i had maguro , unagi . spicy tuna roll , and the vegas roll . nothing struck me as super fresh , the key ingredient to a great sushi experience . i would never of my own choice go to eat here .		2		0
another indian reviewer here . this place is a complete disappointment and i * never * eat there . a friend and i went for lunch once and became so aggravated at sitting and waiting at our table with no service that we were cussing under our breath by the time the waiter came , giving new meaning to the word `` waiter '' . the food is mediocre . i did n't like -lrb- or trust -rrb- the quality of the chicken in my chicken tikka masala . there is far better indian food to be had throughout the valley .		2		0
so i am writing this review after trying the restaurant out 3 times now . 1st experience : i was with a bachelorette party on st. patrick 's day 2010 and we stopped into rnr . the bartender was friendly & we had great service . overall a good experience in the 30-45 minutes we were there for a drink & a shot at the bar . 2nd experience : a friend and i decided to try out there bottomless mimosa 's for $ 10 one sunday morning . i recall the animal fries being tasty & the mimosa 's were alright . nothing special , but worth the money as long as you had 2 or more . the service was so-so . overall a fairly good experience . 3rd & final experience : i can honestly say that today we had the worst service i have ever experienced in a restaurant in my 27.5 years on this third rock from the sun . to begin , we sat at our table on the patio for 30 minutes before i finally called the hostess over to see if we even had a server for our table . she informed us that there was & she went to find the server . after 5 or 10 minutes she comes back and informed us that they are `` swamped '' and that she will be taking our drink order for the server . mind you this was lunch on a thursday afternoon . this place was n't anywhere near `` swamped '' . she brings us our waters and informs us a few minutes later that she will also be taking our food order & that she will pass it on to our server whom we still have not seen at this point . as she starts to take our order our server finally shows up at the table . he apologizes and takes our order . the food came out in a reasonable amount of time & the order was correct . nobody brought us silverware , so i had to request it . then i realized there was no salt or pepper on our table so instead of letting my food get cold while i waited for our server to reappear , i asked the table next to us if we could borrow theirs . our water glasses were left empty for 15-20 minutes . and it took forever for our server to bring us our check after we requested it and then it took him equally as long to pick up the check with our payment inside it . i was in absolute shock that nobody offered us a complimentary beverage , appetizer , or dessert for the horrible serve we received which they were completely aware of considering how they kept apologizing . we paid our full $ 27 bill & left ... our lunch did n't just cost us money , it cost us almost 3 hours of our afternoon . i will not be returning to this establishment .		2		0
this update is based on dining there last may . it was a surprise birthday dinner for one of the guests . server did n't seem well groomed and needed to brush his teeth . drinks were empty for extended periods . my fish was undercooked and the manager did n't seem that worried about it when i pointed it out to him . food quality declined for sure . the tuna appetizer was good though and the view as always made for a nice atmosphere . most everyone was content with the food but no one raved about it . the server dropped dessert menus when i had instructed a bday dessert tray w candle to come out . some one must 've reminded him bc 5 min later he hastily picked up our dessert menus . no coffee was offered and the bday guest wanted a cappaccino . he did n't want to wait any longer so decided not to pursue it . i was very annoyed with the server by now and thought that the bday guest should get a friggin cappaccino if he wanted one , so i went to some servers and asked them to bring one . when the check came , the receipt with the added gratuity was behind another copy w out it and the credit card slips so the person paying nearly tipped again but caught it before he did . very very disappointing . what happened to this place .		2		0
this is normal bar food , so you get what you would expect . i sat at the bar and the service was poor . it took forever for the bartender to take my order , and then for the food to arrive . she was walking around , talking to other employees & messing with the tv 's , while i was patiently waiting for my food . i ordered an appetizer and a meal . when the food finally came out everything came at once instead of my appetizer first as anybody would want and should expect . so , i waited a long time and then the order was messed up . shocker ! i asked the bartender to put my main meal back under the heat while i ate my appetizer , which she did . however , when i was done with the appetizer it took me a while to find her again to tell her i was ready for my main meal . expecting a timely refill was n't even a thought on her mind either , but it did n't shock me at that point . so , normal bar food and poor service .		2		0
we were here years ago -lrb- actually dicks hideway -rrb- and loved the tamales so dropped in when we drove by . we had our kid with us and did n't think that would be an issue , but felt the cold shoulder when we walked in . we felt unwelcome , and the hostess seemed to have an attitude . no one smiled , once . at all . when we were taken to the table , the hostess just stared at the server and we stood there uncomfortably in silence for an oddly long period of time . we were n't offered the specials and had to ask about tamales , which were a special . we were talking about how we felt like our presence was an inconvenience and i think someone overheard , because then the waitress started being nicer . the food was n't as good as we remembered and the experience was miserable and we wo n't be coming back .		2		0
our first fox restaurant was sauce , which we like very much and continue to go back for both lunch and dinner . since then , it 's been mostly down hill . we have been to blanco twice , north once and now the greene house . my feeling with each of these places is that they 're one or maybe two food items good . the rest is just m ` eh ! clearly the fox group knows how to make a very good , flavorful taco . four stars good , both here and at blanco . as for the rest of the story , to paraphrase paul harvey ... we came here yesterday for a light lunch . i spotted the tuna tartar tacos on the menu and knew i had to try them . at the time , i had n't seen any of the posted pictures on yelp . too bad . the tacos were three tiny , minuscule things about three inches wide . our server did try to warn us they were small and asked if i wanted a fourth ? sure , i said . so three tiny tacos for $ 13.00 and the fourth for $ 4.50 . were they good ? yes . were they better than the ones down the street at tommy bahamas ? sadly no . my lunch partner had their fish and chips for $ 15.00 and was very unimpressed . `` bland and nothing special , mushy and greasy '' were his exact words . the lunch bill for two came to $ 38.75 , along with one iced tea . a little pricey for a two and half star experience . . sorry !		2		0
03/19/10 kitschy , fun country-life decor . there was about a 15-minute waiting time . lots of older citizens waiting , which made for interesting chit-chat amongst the women . it 's refreshing when a restaurant 's setting allows people to feel comfortable enough to interact among strangers -- mom and i encounter so many `` closed '' individuals on a daily basis at work , so this is a nice change of pace for us . staff here seem friendly and busy , but efficient . at least , ours was . one complaint : it 's a bit cramped in here . it would be nice to have a little privacy from other neighboring tables , especially when i spied a room in the back that had maybe four 4-tops , and only one was occupied . ca n't recall what mom ordered , but i was n't surprised that she did n't enjoy it -- the menu description definitely did not appeal to me . website does not list a menu , and all i can recall is that it was an omelet w / a couple of fibrous veggies -lrb- snow peas and something else ; it was a strange combo , of that i 'm sure of . chestnuts , maybe ? -rrb- . i went w / a belgian waffle , two eggs , and bacon . coffee was weak , but our server offered to brew a stronger pot . nice ! while we waited for our selections , she brought out some mini-muffins to enjoy , and that we did ! we both really liked the bran . i also enjoyed the zucchini -- mom thought she detected cinnamon -lrb- not a fave of hers -rrb- , but i think it 's the nutmeg she was referring to . then again , i may be mistaken ... waffle was , well , a waffle . no accompanying fruit compotes or coulis to liven things up . i always bring my own 100 % organic maple syrup , because while most restaurants say they offer maple syrup , it is n't 100 % pure , but a blend of maple and corn syrups . -lrb- if it smells like mrs. butterworth 's , it is n't 100 % maple . just sayin ' . -rrb- eggs were cooked to over-medium , just that way i like 'em . bacon was very nice . cute saucer and dinner plates , lovely mini-muffins -lrb- we bought extra to-go ! -rrb- , good bacon , and efficient service make for a solid two stars . i would n't mind giving ktc another try , if we 're in the area . next time we 'll try the pancakes and crepes !		2		0
we took a trip on our lunch hour to grab some grub for work . i had the burrito special `` chicken piccata '' . umm as long as i have lived , chicken piccata consists of : chicken breast cutlets , dredged in flour , browned , served with sauce of butter , lemon juice , capers , and stock or wine . right ? this was none of those things . . it was more like a chicken fajita burrito and bland at that . it was decent and hefty but im sorry baja fresh blows this place out of the water .		2		0
odd happy hour . terrible food . the only time in my life i 've ever seen a group order chicken wings and not finish them . i mean , that 's saying something is n't it ? two stars because they have guinness on tap and it 's a convenient location so i always seem to end up there when i am in tempe , even though it 's not very good . note to self : beer only next time .		2		0
came here last night once again for karaoke with my wife and our friend kathy r . we got there early so we could have a leisurely dinner before karaoke . the saloon was n't that crowded like two weeks ago yet the service was much slower . we could n't help noticing two women were seated after we arrived and were immediately given menus while we were still waiting on someone to come take our order . after waiting some more a gal took our drink orders . more waiting they were finally delivered to our table . not long after we got our drinks our waiter came over and took our food order . we all got a hamburger , salad and a small bowl of clam chowder . to our surprise everything came out all at once . we were not expecting this at all . we even mentioned how disappointed that our food arrived all at once because some of it will get cold by the time were ready to eat it . this complaint seemed to go on deaf ears . this being said the burgers were good . nothing to write home about just good . my wife carol and kathy ordered a slice of pie for desert . carol got he coconut cream pie which she enjoyed . kathy got the mixed berry pie . she thought it was way to sweet . in fact a few of our friends joined us later one ordered the cherry pie . she commented how over powering sweet it was and did n't finish it . another thing to note was no one cleared our plates after dinner . they were piling up . we were constantly moving them to make room at our table . after a while the people seated next to us finished their meal so we bused our own table and took everything to where they were seated . later since we stayed for karaoke we ordered potato skins appetizer . they were greasy tasting -lrb- i mean how greasy -rrb- so we wo n't be getting them again . yick ! food : the food was just `` ok '' . nothing remarkable at all . i expected more e considering the small sample i had on my first of kathy r 's burger . price : reasonable . service : the service was much slower this time around . ambiance : an 1800 's old western bar . conclusion : i 'm still willing to go back even though i this visit was below my expectations . return factor : 90 % ************************* what does my overall rating mean ? ************************* 5 stars - highly recommended . i would be willing to drive out of my way to this business . it is that good . this place represents their industry or cuisine very well ! 4 stars - highly recommended . i would frequent this business . 3 stars - not that good but not that bad . just average . i would n't mind going again . 2 stars - i would not recommend this establishment to friends or family . 1 stars - do yourself a favor and do not patronize this business . i would run away from this place and you should too ! do n't wast your hard earned money at this establishment !		2		0
i have n't actually been inside luci 's , but we had lunch brought in to our office from here so i have had the food . to start with , i was n't very impressed by the menu , it was really small , and not very exciting to say the least . i ended up just getting the tomato soup because it was a cold day and i figured it would warm me up . well the soup started out good , it was like a creamy tomato , but after a few more bites i just could n't handle it anymore ... there was way too much pepper ... it made it almost inedible ! if they had backed off on the pepper it would have been good , but it was too overwhelming . also , they messed up quite a few of our orders , making for some unhappy people . i think we all decided that we would n't be ordering from them again , and i will probably never see the inside because of our experience .		2		0
if i had to judge this place in less than 10 words , i would say - disappointing nobu knock-off that left my wallet empty . wow . what a huge disappointment . i came here for my birthday the other night . after my husband dropped over $ 400 for 4 people -lrb- included food for 4 and 3 drinks , no dessert -rrb- , i left highly dissatisfied . i can name a dozen japanese restaurants around the country , including mom and pop robata dives , neighborhood sushi restaurants and high end places like nobu that do seafood and robata better than this place . while the owner payed a lot of attention to detail when decorating this place , the same can not be said of the food . everything was off . the grilled fishes were not seasoned to perfection , the fried foods were just not crispy enough , the sushi was completely unmemorable , the drinks were mediocre , and the black cod was the worst i have ever had . i 'm happy to pay good money for an excellent food experience , but mediocre food at $ $ $ $ $ prices is just grossly annoying . i will not return here .		2		0
stopped in by myself for lunch . the place is nice inside , but the back door was open and the whole restaurant smelled from the employees smoking by the back door . service was adequate . i had the chicken noodle pho , which was serviceable . it came with a plate of the typical garnish , and there was the usual siracha , fish sauce , and such on the table already . i will give them another try , but with some friends .		2		0
i stopped by here for lunch on recommendation that their bar food was better than average . i ordered their bacon burger with fries , ice tea . the ice tea was peachy in taste , which i do not care for . what ever happened to good pekoe ice tea !!! the burger was ordered well done , however was delivered with raw meat in the center . i know i may be particular , but i am paying for this and my expectations are not over the top with simple cooking . overall the fries were very good . the place was excessively loud , another place where you pay for the privilege of yelling at your dinner companion ... which i do not care for . wont be back !!		2		0
the burger i had there was tasteless and had a weird texture . the fries were decent and their signature rootbeer was delicious , but i 've definitely had better elsewhere . in all fairness , i did not try their frozen selection , so i will definitely come back to give them another try .		2		0
this hard rock is really nothing special . it is much smaller than most of them and does n't have any really spectacular memorabilia in it . still , it is a good place to get souvenirs that say phoenix and very convenient to downtown sporting events . food and service are ok .		2		0
tempe marketplace has gone down hill . it 's always been impossible to navigate , and the crowds seem to grow and grow . it 's a cool concept but nothing really `` wows '' me about this place . the stores are typical ; it takes three times longer to find what you 're looking for , especially since the digital directories are frequently broken . aside from the navigational clusterfuck , it 's gotten really dirty . i do n't feel incredibly safe with the loiterers and drunks that hang out by dave and buster 's and cadillac ranch either . if i were to do an outdoor mall i 'd head over to scottsdale quarter or kierland instead .		2		0
i do n't get the hype . it did n't taste right . never going back		2		0
what to say ? food ... serviceable . staff ... adequate . wait time ... short ... even on friday night . good place to take a family if for no other reason that cost . otherwise , if you get into another restaurant on a friday night , go there . if not , then osf will serve the purpose of putting a meal on the table .		2		0
after checking out of the hotel from my staycation with the girls we decided to check grab some breakfast here since my friends absolutely love this place . it was super packed and we had to wait almost an hr for a table which was fine with me it gave us a chance to hang outside and people watch : -- rrb - . we were all starved once we were seated so we ordered right away . i started with coffee and decided to go with one of their club plates that came with eggs , potatoes o ' brien , toast and fruit ... for my meat i decided to go with sausage . the plate looked amazing when it came out but i was really disappointed with how bland everything was ... the eggs which i requested to be scrambled with cheese were bland , the sausage and potatoes were also blah . i felt like i had all of this food and i was just eating it because i was hungry . the best part of the meal was the toast and the fruit , you ca n't mess that up ! at least the service was decent : -- rrb - i may give this place a do over but i may have to come during the week so i do n't have to wait an hr for a table .		2		0
as my husband so accurately put it while we shared a drink on the crappy patio , `` i 've seen better ambience in a chuck e. cheese . ''		2		0
i 'm sorry i just do n't get it . this place is huge and always packed . my in-laws always want to go , so i 've been there a bunch . i feel excited to go inside when i get there because it has a cool atmosphere of this semi-old world , pueblo restaurant . other than that , i think it 's barely decent mexican food and cocktails .		2		0
how in god 's name can ice cream be boring ? i 'm not sure , but this place manages to do it . i 've had a few different flavors , and it 's generic , flavorless , flat , monotonous , and blah all around . oh yeah , and not super cheap either ... mmm no thanks .		2		0
there are so many great places to get fast mexican food and this is n't one of them . it 's not terrible , and i still go from time to time because its close . it 's clean , quick and convenient .		2		0
i wish i loved mi patio . i could walk here from my house . it 's cheap and has a big menu . the margaritas are yummy and cost the same as pop . it 's cute , inside and out . but the food ... ? it 's just ... so ... blah . and there 's so much amazing mexican food in the area , why in god 's name would you settle for blah ? every time my so and i go by it , we look at each other , shrug , and say , `` i wish we liked that place ! '' maybe we 'll give it another try sometime soon ...		2		0
came in to order a barbecue feast to eat and watch game 7 , however , there was not enough meat left in this joint to order a feast : -lrb- . the biggest disappointment is that i completed a huge order just to have another employee come from the kitchen and tell me , `` sorry we do n't have x , y , and z. '' so since the bbq joint had no bbq , i ordered a hot link sandwich and left . the sandwich was average , the service was quasi-average , and the organization of this restaurant was well below average . i 'm hesitant to return .		2		0
there 's a reason i avoided this venue for so long - because i did n't want to be pushed up against a bunch of sweaty people . but the right occasion and the right band pulled me from my comfort zone and into the marquee theatre . i 'm not going to bitch about the parking , $ 5 is n't bad for an event and the lot was across the street . once we got there they separated us into boy/girl lines . since it was an anniversary gift for my husband , i had the cash to pay and had to jump out of line to give it to him . i tried going to the front of the line to see how we purchased tickets and they directed me back to the line . after i get searched , have by bag gone through , put my boots back on , get my drivers license scanned , get a wrist band , they finally ask for a ticket . somewhere during that huge process you think they would have let you purchase a ticket . from the line we were standing in there was no way to see the ticket booths , never mind i had already asked some idiot working there . we finally get in and the drinks were stiff and reasonably priced . the theatre had very poor ventilation and airflow , it was like being inside a sauna . the stage is a decent size and the ground slopes down -lrb- as most theatres do -rrb- for better viewing . the sound however was not so great . i did like that they had little bars set up inside the theatre , it made the lines shorter . there 's a patio with a few benches and that 's all the seating in the entire place . the marquee was all i expected it to be except for the sound . you 'd think a music venue would care more about acoustics . oh , from the patio you can see all the people getting pulled over by tempe police , watching someone get a dui always puts a nice damper on your night .		2		0
second time at one of these places . nothing really standing out and how long can you really stare at someone 's `` twin peaks '' . it is actually easier to check out their backsides in the cute brown shorts if your feeling really pervy . these girls are more robotic at this chain than others with the same theme . anyway , the tv situation is pretty perfect , but i 'm not interested in paying $ 6.25 for an off tasting brown beer when you should be running some sort of football specials . the mozzarella sticks , which were crazy good in denver , took a dive at this location . they just were n't cooked long enough . it 's an easy menu for the cooks to make , nothing creative either . i would rather buy a six pack and switch between the game and soft porn at home and then you can get the same experience . the outdoor patio is pretty nice though .		2		0
why does this place still exist ? back when sizzler went out of business sometime in the mid-90 's one marketing expert explained the reasons behind it like this : `` there was no longer any question people were asking to which the answer was ` sizzler ' '' . soon after it lost relevance -- and went through at least one bankruptcy -- the chain disappeared . cpk is a nicely-decorated facility at a great location , but besides being the only pizzeria in the biltmore fashion park proper , there is very little reason to visit here . it 's not the answer to any current question . the pizza is never better than so-so . the toppings are never really that fresh . the salads are an uninspired-though-nicely-arranged pile of iceberg and other ingredients that would n't seem extraordinary at applebee 's . in fact , i think applebee 's does salad better . the service tends to be a bit slow . the drinks are pricey . for all this indifferent straight-from-sysco quality , you pay a premium price . it 's probably been 10 years since this place has had any cachet that might justify the higher prices . maybe longer . i think they might be hurting since the departure of planet hollywood , which itself brought a study stream of cornpone slackjaws impressed by a name -- though not enough to keep it in business . if you 're looking for pizza in this part of the camelback corridor , hold out and go to the parlor at 19th st.		2		0
hillside is doing everything right , except the bread . i looked past it the first time . called it a fluke , went back tried other thing . but this bad bread ruins a whole sandwich . it looks like european bread , it is not . hillside needs to change bread distributors . it could be as simple as `` la brea '' or even `` fresh and easy 's '' new bakery products . it is tragic because i love everything hillside has done ; the windows the open kitchen the casual environment remind me of the greatest restaurants in town ; la grande orange , true food and the vig . i would eat here weekly if only they were n't compromising on the bread . to the owners , i plead , get some gourmet breads , european style , herb breads , sourdough , breads , whole grain with nuts , even sprouted grain breads if you want to cater to the super healthy , but the croissant-looking , roman meal tasting bread should go .		2		0
i 'm afraid i just do n't understand the hype of mi patio . the restaurant has plenty of parking and it has a good location . it 's clean and the decor is really bright and fun . the staff is friendly enough , but i did n't like the food . i did n't really care for the salsa . it was fresh , but it had a muddled flavor of old cilantro that i did n't like . also , the chips were stale . our food came out quickly , but i was pretty underwhelmed . i had the beef enchiladas with green sauce . the rice and beans had a burnt flavor ; it 's hard to describe , but i did n't like it . the meat did not taste fresh , and i could n't see or taste the green sauce . personally -lrb- and i know i 'm in the minority here -rrb- , i thought there was way too much cheese on the plate . i like cheese , but i do n't want so much that it makes the food greasy . my husband had beef tacos with rice and beans . he liked the rice , but he felt that the beef was n't fresh . he did n't finish his plate . the prices were pretty cheap , but i feel like the food and experience was overhyped . i do n't think i 'll be back .		2		0
tried this place for lunch today , was n't really impressed , seeing the number of 5 's on here . the french fries are frozen , floppy , and they do n't have much flavor . maybe i 'm spoiled by in n out 's real potatoes , but i like my fries tasting like potatoes . and seasoned , at least . the chocolate malt was also just ok . in fact , it barely tasted like malt , and was way too sweet . i prefer a less sugary chocolate taste . and finally , the burger . i got their wisconsin melt , which is essentially a patty melt with two burgers . it was well seasoned , but the seasoning was cut out by the amount of butter/griddle grease they use , so i could only taste the seasoning every once in a while , not good . also , for a patty melt , there is a lack of onions , which i greatly disapprove of . the whole thing was kinda greasy , and left a terrible feeling in my mouth afterwards , which is being currently washed down by a becks . in conclusion , just go to in n out .		2		0
i was craving some pad thai and i noticed this place when i was headed to the arrowhead area . i will say that the staff were really friendly but the pad that was just ok . it was made with ramen noodles and not pad thai noodles . i asked for thai hot , and it was no where near hot , let alone thai hot . i will say that the eggrolls i got were very tasty , but the pad thai left much to be desired . i will give this place it another try to see if it was a fluke .		2		0
i was underwhelmed . i went for lunch with a friend an sat on the patio . while some of the bohemian ` charm ' of palette was definitely gone , the shaded patio is still a comfortable , welcoming space , even on a 95 degree day . -lrb- and perhaps more so , with some of the ` clutter ' gone . -rrb- what got to me was the slow and somewhat rude service . despite several empty tables , we waited well over 30 minutes for our food , after waiting at least 10 minutes for our order to be taken . when we asked after our food , we were abruptly told it was coming , only to wait another 10 minutes . this is unacceptable for a weekday lunch when you have to get back to work . when the food finally arrived , i was disappointed . i had the cola ham sandwich and fries . the sandwich was mediocre and the fries were tepid and greasy . my colleague had the salad which he seemed to enjoy -lrb- although not enough to warrant any comments -rrb- i understand everybody has off days , etc , , so i 'll be back , especially to check out the brunch . it is great to have a locally owned non-corporate restaurant in an historic house with a great patio in downtown phoenix , so i have high hopes my experience next time will match some of the better reviews on this site .		2		0
the beer selection sucks and the little bit of food i have had here was unimpressive . but ! a good place to people watch ? and be watched ? if you 're into that .		2		0
came here tonight to the living room and ordered an irish coffee . gal behind the bar seemed unsure ... had to go get some other guy to go in the back to get the coffee . okay , whatever , but that took 5 minutes , she presents me with a to-go coffee cup , takes off the lid and proceeds to pour less than half a shot of bailey 's in it ... `` there you go '' . really ? an irish coffee , my dear , is bailey 's , whiskey , and coffee . what she brought me was hours-old coffee with no discernible bailey 's at all . i tell her what 's in an irish coffee . `` oh , i put some bailey 's in it . '' `` could you throw a shot of jameson 's in that for me , please ? and , i 've never seen it served this way before . '' `` oh , how do you get it . '' `` usually in a glass mug . i 'd like that for here . '' that took another few minutes while coffee guy searched for a mug . sheesh ! she was nice , but ... really ? i was just surprised , as that is an all-too-common drink . $ 10 . 2 points for bartendership . i like the chillax atmosphere , though .		2		0
they remodeled the place a few years ago - it still sucks . it 's usually impossible to find parking . the bathrooms remind me of the `` worst toilet in scotland '' from trainspotting . the people that frequent this place are trying so hard to be different that they just end up being the same . this place sprang from a need to have a place in scottsdale where people could dance and not have to hang around scottsdale douchebags and snobs and plastics ... ironically , this place has become full of a new breed of snobs and douchebags . there 's no official dress code , but there is a dress code - you have to look like a fashion disaster or alterna-hipster with your `` unique '' uniform . it 's nearly impossible to get a drink unless you know someone or look like you know someone or perhaps have fucked someone who works there . it 's the kind of place that belongs in phoenix - it 's conveniently located in scottsdale though . i have friends who love this place , but i just think it 's a shit-hole . i 'm sure if i was still in college , i 'd like it . i 'm just too old for this kind of thing - not quite ` cool ' enough . what 's funny is that a year or so ago , it was more of a punky place .		2		0
you do realize that this is n't the pool at mandalay ? and you realize , on monday , you will have to go back to the cash register and us magazine ? and really , you thought it would be a good idea to get a tattoo of your dog on your shoulder ? ... next to the tribal swirl ? all questions i did n't ask , but did wonder , while at spanish fly . if you want to hang out at or near a pool with scottsdale 's `` finest '' , well this is the place . it is presently exhibit a. of course , at night , stay out of that pool ! no , i am serious , they will physically take you out if need be . but , during the day , you and dog tattoo boy can hang out in the water all day . the service is friendly , well minus the typical scottsdale door people , who generally fail , as always , to remember that they are not working the new hot club in la or nyc -lrb- come on people , south park makes fun of scottsdale !! -rrb- . oddly , at night -lrb- because of the pool i presume -rrb- , you need to sign a waiver ... i will leave it aside as to whether that waiver would ever hold up in court . the drinks run the norm , but i 've never had the food , however i did see someone carrying out sushi rolls to a table in the 100 degree heat ... ummm , no thanks . the djs ... ehhh , the usual , but better than drift . if you want to see 20 somethings in bikinis , a few cougars on the prowl , high rise baseball hats , shorts and high tops , and really bad tattoos ... plus catch some water and sun , this is a good spot . it is worth a 30 minute show if there is no cover , but it is hard to swallow as an afternoon hang out , and i would never pay to get in .		2		0
this restaurant has a much smaller menu for a thai place . it makes it simple to look through , but i was hoping for a new favorite of mine , the thai soya fish , and they did n't have it on their menu . i opted for the grilled seafood which states on the menu that it comes on a bed of vegetables with thai hot sauce . what it turned out to be was a combination of shrimp , scallops , calamari , and fish on top of ... lettuce , with thai hot sauce . so essentially a fish salad . the shrimp , scallop , and calamari were tasty , but the fish was awful . dry , fishy-tasting . i could n't eat it . their fresh roll appetizer was pretty good but not the best i 've ever had . i did n't think my meal was worth the $ 15 price tag , and just so you know ahead of time this establishment does not have a liquor license in case you are looking for cocktails or thai beer to accompany your dinner . clean bathrooms . decent service-our water was repeatedly filled , but for the food itself i would not return when there are so many other choices in the valley .		2		0
following my brother 's suggestion -lsb- he 's been here before -rsb- , about five of us headed out to saddle ranch on a saturday night . while going through their ridiculous i.d. checking -lsb- twice -rsb- , we finally got our flashing-beeper-thingy . we waited for about 45 minutes so it was n't too bad -- after all , it - is - a bar at westgate . so our table finally opens up and we all sit down . we had such a friendly and funny waiter . i had ordered a mojito but apparently they did n't have mint leaves . damn . so i had a texas tea and two others ordered their fruity drinks -lsb- those guys -_- ; ;] . our drinks had arrived in carafes ! after viewing our huuuge drinks -lsb- about $ 12 a pop -rsb- and the crazies on the mechanical bull , we all decided to leave after the booze . maybe it 's not my kind of scene but i definitely did n't like it there . so the highlight of that saturday night : denny 's . hah !		2		0
meh . my standards for quality froyo are high since i frequent yogurtology -lrb- shea and scottsdale -rrb- , yogurtland -lrb- i 'm the duke in scottsdale -rrb- , and sometimes i go to mojo in tempe . this place has `` ok '' flavors . i had the original tart , that was quite a bit tart . the toppings are ok . my friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips , but that 's because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home , and she did n't have to use her personal stash . since it made her happy , i gave this place an extra star . i 'm cool like that . hmm ... let 's see . they have a snow machine . not really sure what this is for . it seems out of place . it 's far from my house , and not really worth my drive . i guess if it was by my house , and i had no other options , i 'd frequent this business . this is the one time , and one time only that i will say this ... thank god , i live in old town scottsdale .		2		0
i went here on a groupon , and my initial thought was `` i 'm glad i only paid 50 % . '' the ribs were too fatty and in small pieces -lrb- like bony riblets -rrb- . it was heavily sauced , so i have no idea if it was properly smoked . the atmosphere was okay but is far from the best in the valley . the highlight was their mac & cheese . oh , and rc cola ? seriously ?		2		0
pretty middling . the black and bleu burger was a respectable middle-tier burger . it came with `` seasoned fries , '' but i 'm pretty sure the only thing on them was salt . i guess salt is technically a seasoning ... i had their on-tap root beer , which they tout as having a slight toffee and vanilla taste . i would 've liked to taste more toffee -lrb- hardly noticeable -rrb- and less vanilla . i 'm not a fan of vanilla ; it makes a root beer taste a little too weak . give me more sassafras , maybe a touch more wintergreen , and drop the vanilla . overall , it 's not a bad meal for the money , but it 's pretty unspectacular . i guess you ca n't expect a whole lot from a pizza chain ...		2		0
let me say this : the bar at hanny 's is one of the best looking bars in phoenix . this square-shaped sparkly thing gets an a + on the presentation , and they make some great cocktails . the rest of the place ... not so much . i agree with everyone else : hanny 's has a great concept for a place . they left the skeleton of an old department store intact -- complete with a completely unusable second story -- but the results are n't spectacular . the restaurant looks great inside , like it should be a real classy establishment . so why are they serving pizzas here ? the pies are decent , yeah , but really ? should n't we be getting steak here ? prime rib ? a nice grouper fillet perhaps ? with such a nice space and a primo location right in the heart of downtown , i 'd think hanny 's could step it up in the food department . it 's like this place is confused about who it wants to be : a neighborhood fare spot or a classy dining destination .		2		0
very low key , more of a serve yourself type of joint . the grapefruit beer is excellent if you like fruit beers , not a wine drinker so my choices were limited , also not having food was a let down ... world of beer is known to excel in beer and only beer , this place is so small it should have finger foods .		2		0
you walk in and are greeted by espn on the tv , gypsy kings on the radio , and a bbq restaurant that almost exclusively serves gourmet mexican . talk about an identity crisis . we wound up ordering mexican and every dish was underwhelming and not worth the price tag . they also charged our party of 6 a 20 % gratuity to boot . guys , i recommend you go back to the drawing board and come up with a consistent concept .		2		0
this is the closest location to our house , so when we 're in the mood for pf changs , this is our spot . we have our fav dishes here : tofu lettuce wraps http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-changs-china-bistro-scottsdale?select=ltmgiekaejuswjtgycxpfg#ltmgiekaejuswjtgycxpfg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-changs-china-bistro-scottsdale?select=qmpwvgbfba0wncorx5mjng#qmpwvgbfba0wncorx5mjng dali chicken tofu pad thai http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p-f-changs-china-bistro-scottsdale?select=aytcx1h_ftz7fl4uge8abw#aytcx1h_ftz7fl4uge8abw we like the unique flavor of pf changs , but it 's not on our regular rotation of restaurants anymore . we only come by when we get the urge to have one of their signature dishes like the dali chicken or tofu lettuce wraps . the food tastes the same , but i think they 've cut down on their portion size over the past few years while keeping prices the same ... sneaky . for instance , with the lettuce wraps , we only got 3 small lettuce leaves with the order . in the past , we 'd get 1/2 a head of lettuce with large leaves . also , i remember when we would be able to share entrees and eat family style . now , it 's not really possible . the service here is hit & miss . the last visit , we had to waive down our server for everything ... refill water glasses , order more wine , wth ?! however , the 2 visits before that our server was attentive . return factor - 50 %		2		0
i ca n't find it in me to give this place more than two stars . the atmosphere is not bad , pretty much expected for a wine bar . however there are some tacky elements ... our high-top table and both stools were annoyingly wobbly , and a member of the waitstaff was sitting at a computer using facebook at the bar -lrb- klassy -rrb- . the service was terrible ... to the point where we were ready to walk out if the waiter made one more trip past our table without so much as eye contact . we walked to the bar for our second round of drinks after waiting with empty glasses for about 15 minutes -lrb- the same amount of time it took us to get our first round -rrb- . when the waiter to patron ratio is about 1:1 , you 'd expect a lot more ... i 'm sticking to postino .		2		0
first the good , as nothing was great ... the pulled pork is good . the mac & cheese is good . the mashed potatoes is/are good . the baked potato is good . next , the ok ... the baked beans are ok . the cobb salad is ok . the bbq sauce is ok . the smoked chicken is ok . finally , the eeewwwch ... the brisket , the ribs , the hot links were all gross . and the ribs , in particular , had an `` off-putting taste '' about them that caused me a great deal of distress . never again .		2		0
the husband and i went here because we had a couple coupons for a free wine flight , glass of wine , and flatbread ... who can say no to that ? the concept is good , healthy food that is fresh and low cal . the service was also very good . the wine flight had generous tastes of each wine -lrb- with the mini glasses taken over in a glass holding device ... pretty cool stuff -rrb- and each glass had the name and description of the wine . that part of the experience was good . the flatbreads , however , just were nothing too special . the husband got the pesto chicken and i got the goat cheese and artichoke . both were just kind of bland ... they were much better with red chili flakes . it is n't something that i would come back for . now , i know it 's hard to judge a restaurant on a couple of flat breads , so if i were invited here by a friend or something , i would give it another shot , as i do like the concept , but i do n't think i would return on my own .		3		0
this is the closest place that offers a decent bowl of pho , my comfort food on a cold or cloudy day . i always have my order taken out since this little place is always packed during lunch time . i 've tried the pho with beef -lrb- # 11 -rrb- , the tea lite sandwich with grilled beef , and the bun -lrb- # 3 -rrb- . and my fav is the pho , especially the broth ! the sandwich was okay , i thought the grilled beef was a bit too salty . . and the bun was good , but the same as the sandwich , salty beef ... this is definitely a good place to grab a quick lunch with limited time , fast , affordable , and tasty !!		3		0
i headed to ra for a happy hour with a couple of friends last week . we sat outside and were quite comfortable , thanks to the well placed heaters . our server was nice enough , but not very engaging . we really enjoyed the pineapple cream cheese wontons - enough that we ordered a second serving ! the spicy salmon and tootsy maki rolls were delicious , but we were n't very impressed with the vegas roll ... it had an overwhelming strong mayo taste . otherwise , it would 've been a very tasty roll though . not a bad happy hour spot , if you are looking for some cheaper sushi , but the drinks are still pretty pricey . at the very end of our meal , our server brought over two drinks that she said they `` wanted us to try '' - nice , but there were three of us ... one of us was supposed to just watch the others drink , i guess ? and unfortunately , the free drink was absolutely unpalatable - some kind of strawberry sake martini ? avoid it if at all possible . instead , the mango martini and the shiso naughty are much better options !		3		0
the restaurant is cute , the ambiance is nice , the service is good . i found it odd that you have to leave the restaurant to get to the bathroom . the food was just okay . it was n't bad but was n't anything to write home about either . i had the spring roll appetizer and was a tad disappointed ... i have had much better other places . for dinner i had eggplant and tofu and that was good but i had to ask for a bit more sauce which was quickly accomodated . the wine was tasy and the plantain dessert was as well . i wo n't go out of my way to go back again .		3		0
one thing that has not changed about phoenix in 20 + years is that there are a lot of places trying to get you to come in and drink and dine . the other thing that is still true is that service sucks in the majority of your casual dining places . though the bartender is n't professionally trained . she had a nice personality which was a nice and welcomed change . took her awhile to find the southern comfort , tisk tisk . made the most god awful vodak collins i have ever come across that i returned it to her . the wings were good but not tossed in sauce , they give you a dipping bowl . different but forunately the wings could stand alone . busy for a monday night , so that 's a good thing also . room layout is nice and they now allow dogs on the patio . so 3 stars i 'll come check it out again .		3		0
yes , it was pert near the best damn coffee i ever had . too bad the cup did n't even get filled - i do n't appreciate paying $ 2.75 for a diner-sized cup of coffee that 's only two-thirds full . it was n't that good . no , the baristas were n't too cool to take my order . quite the opposite actually . the guy who helped was awesome and genuine . after finding out it was my first trip , he explained how it all worked and invited me over to watch him make my drink . very cool . no , they do n't technically have free wifi ... or any wifi . i called ahead of time and was told they did . sure enough -lrb- as another reviewer already noted -rrb- they piggyback on wet paint 's connection . after 10 minutes of messing around , the aforementioned barista helped me get online . however , it sat there for minutes trying to load any page . a bust . no food . uber hipsters as well as normal asu kids , hippies , bike geeks , tech geeks , etc. . all in all i would totally come back -- when they get their own damn internet connection . -lrb- come on guys , spring the $ 60 a month to have the second most important thing people come to cafes for -rrb- oh , and when i said i first heard of the place thru yelp , the same barista immediately asked what i took away from all the reviews , and if i had seen the not-so-glowing reviews . i only addressed the clientele notes and quality of coffee accolades , and he went on to say they are very much aware of their yelp presence and take it very seriously . ... and i took that to mean that they care about what customers think , so keep the criticisms coming , because at least one worker cares to address and correct them . and i very much respect that .		3		0
plenty of chicago stuff on the walls , like a hundred other chicago-style places in the city , but this did seem just a little more authentic . there was a sign on one of the doors inside - not sure the details - that said free sliders if the cubs or sox win the world series . a couple old arcade games adds to the charm . i ordered a western burger -lrb- typical stuff - bacon , bbq , onion rings , cheese -rrb- , and was reasonably happy with the results . the bun was nice and floury , the burger decently flavored , and the cheese was melted and gooey . not the best burger in the world , but i was n't disappointed . the fries were nothing special - not even worth finishing . i keep reading good things about the sliders , so i think i may have to come back to give them a try .		3		0
i like ra , but their specialty drinks have never been very good . the food is n't bad or too expensive , but for some reason i just do n't love this place . you ca n't smoke on the patio -lrb- might be some sort of law that is n't their fault -rrb- , which is a main reason we usually choose sandbar for drinks instead of ra . we come here for sake once in a while because it is so close to home , but i would n't go out of my way to eat or have drinks here .		3		0
great location - right next to the theaters . however , it 's not that impressive if your other choice is buffalo wild wings -lrb- sorry bww hardcore fans , but i dislike `` bar '' food -rrb- . however , the ambience and attentive and fantastic waitstaff really makes this place memorable . they were very courteous about #glutenfree , which is always nice to see in a restaurant , the wait staff had no issues asking the chef multiple times on different items . they also provided a to-go cup for my friend who loved their jasmine iced tea . the food was not mind-blowing , but great for a dinner and a movie kind of night . they looked like they had a great wine listing as well . i was kind of weirded out that the salad came with dressing on the salad , but i guess that 's just the kind of restaurants i 'm used to - the `` oh we always put sauce on the side '' kind of places . my girlfriend really liked the mozzarella sandwich . would recommend this for sure if you 're in the area -lrb- choose this over outback steakhouse please -rrb- - but i would n't go out of my way to go here again . great to know if you 're in the area though !		3		0
i am not really a wine or beer snob and only tend to drink hard liquor when i am sick . the first time i found myself here was right after they opened and things were a bit chaotic and lots of empty spaces on the shelves . last night i again found myself here looking for mothership wit and sure enough they had it . most of the normal places i shop only carry the best selling brew of any label . of course i had to browse and picked up a sa hefeweizer and a bottle of cabernet from a paso robles winery . it is a really cool store and now they carry mgd 30 packs , which they did n't at first , at less than a really deep sale price everyday so i have an excuse to go browse some more . fun but probably not a good thing for my pocketbook . if i was really into wines and tastings and such i would most likely be a bit more excited and give it a 4 instead of a 3 . but most of the time for me it will be more of a place to save a few bucks on stuff i was going to buy elsewhere .		3		0
the setting is great ! i love the lounge couch with the long pillow that you ca n't steal . there 's loud dance music playing so you can bust a move while waiting for your drink at the bar . there 's also a hug big rock in the middle of the floor so you can look silly dancing around it . i went with a couple of friends on a sat nite so the place was crowded with young good looking people . as for the sushi - it was okay to me . it was n't bad , but it did n't give me the `` wow , this is delicious '' reaction . but they do have a squid salad that is very tasty and chewy . great with beer ! they also have a private karaoke room that you can rent . however , if you have been to one of those korean karaoke room , you will be disappointed here . it can be boring looking at a blank screen with just lyrics and the songs are limited to just only american songs . so if you 're looking forward to singing to a super junior music video , it wo n't be here . do n't expect a great sound system and disco lighting . however , they do have a dancing pole in the middle of the room for any sexy ladies to show off their dancing skill .		3		0
why only 3 stars ??? well it was the service and not the food . we have been here before and had really good food and really good service . not last night . we came here for dinner , i was very tired after a long day of work . i just wanted ice tea . no alcohol , which i very rarely drink anyway . t went to wash her hands and asked me to order her a hot water with lemon . when our server sareena came over and i gave her the drink order , she seemed miffed we did not want alcohol . she kept saying , `` you do n't want any cocktails ??? when did cpk become the boozing place , anyway , she brought out the ice tea and hot water , however , no lemon and she was holding the glass from the top . it is a glass coffee mug , it has a handle . why are you putting your fingers all over the tops of the cups . ??? t had to go to get lemon and napkins . she never asked her if she wanted more hot water , but she did refill my ice tea . we ordered the chicken waldorf salad . which was great , but she never asked us what type of dressing we wanted . it has 2 choices . plus she never brought us bread , we had to ask for it . i got the fish tacos and they were quite good made with mahi . t got the kung pao pasta , with shrimp . i sampled that as well and it was awesome . however , sareena never picked up any dishes from our table or trash . the manager did a drive by and she cleaned up the table for us . even the table behind us , yelled out to her , hey can we get some bread ! i do not agree with that , but clearly she did not know the proceedure . when t asked for more hot water , as she was not offered any . our server once again brought out the cup by the top and when she put it down she actually ran her fingers over the lip one more time for good measure . it has a handle , why are you fingering the cups ! of course t was freaked out , because she is such a germ aphobe anyway . but even i do not understand why you would serve a glass or cup like that . we have always had good service at cpk , but not last night . however , the food was very good .		3		0
if you are looking for a unique item , you will find it here . you will also pay dearly . their prices are outrageously high . also , i do n't need the fellow at the meat counter trying to convince me how great it is that their twice baked potatoes iwhich are good -rrb- are over 1 lb each ! i understand you are charging me per lb and want to gouge me as much as possible but , could you care a bit about what the customer wants and maybe offer a couple smaller ones that are not heffer size ? i try to limit how often i go here but , they do have unique items and good quality - just not worth the price tag or the attitude .		3		0
i went to this ra location a few weeks ago for my sisters birthday . i had wanted to go for awhile , even though they got a large amount of negative reviews , but they were mostly about the restaurant and the fish quality , which i do n't eat anyway so i figured it would be fun to try the vegetarian rolls . so we went in on a sunday about 6pm , and there were n't very many people in here , which surprised me . we wanted to sit on the patio but it was full and we did n't feel like waiting the 20 minutes before a spot would open up . so we got a table next to the sushi bar near the back . there was one table full of drunk people behind us that was kind of obnoxious for 6pm , but they left shortly after we arrived so i ca n't complain too much about the atmosphere . it was n't crowded , was n't loud like most people complain about -lrb- i do n't know if that has anything to do with the day we chose to come in -rrb- , so far so good . my sister and i ordered alcoholic beverages , mine was good , but i wish it had more alcohol , and the glass seemed really small . my husband and mom got the green iced tea . my mom liked it , my husband thought it was had a strange powdery flavor . we go over the menu and decide what we want . my sister , mom and husband chose a selection of fish type rolls , while i decided on the avocado roll , cucumber rolls , and vegetarian rolls . we also got three appetizers . edamame , which was ok . a little salty for my taste . pineapple wontons , which everyone said were good . and then we got the tofu appetizer . it was ok . i expected it to be crispier . the appetizers came out in a strange order . not one of them came together . they all came separately , about 5-7 minutes apart . which is weird , but was n't too bad because there was enough food to keep everyone occupied . so after we finished our appetizers , the rolls came out and started filling up the table . i think we ended up with 8 kinds of rolls . i enjoyed my vegetarian rolls . they may have been simple , but they tasted good . i especially liked the avocado rolls . i love avocado . everyone else said their fish rolls tasted really good . my husband especially liked the crispy calamari rolls . his eyes like rolled into the back of his head . lol . but he is easily amused when it comes to food . we then decided on two of the deserts , desert sushi and banana rolls . they were both pretty good . i have had better deserts , but they were n't horrible . i think all in all we were there something over an hour and a half and spent about $ 120 . it seems a little steep for what it was . but i would definitely come back for some take out veggie rolls . this place deserves a solid 3 stars based on my experience . i would rate it a 3.5 if i could . the food was good , the service was not too bad . there were some points in the meal where we wondered where our waitress went off too but she never disappeared for too long . all in all it was a yummy experience .		3		0
i believe they are slightly overrated for what they are , but i enjoy this place nonetheless . sadly , the food here is hit or miss . the hummus is okay -lrb- i 've had way better -rrb- , and the falafel is good only sometimes -lrb- sometimes it 's burnt to hell -rrb- . try the grilled salmon salad - yummy ! the food is not outstanding but it 's a fun place to just kick back and relax . the arcadia location is slightly awkward for seating , but try the scottsdale location and sit on the patio ... good stuff . like other people , i do n't complain about the service - the servers are down-to-earth and fun , not uptight and constantly on you like other places . i appreciate this place .		3		0
this review is just for the shaved snow ice . i saw pics and heard other foodies talk about they have new desserts to try . so after tomo , we decided to drive up north for dessert . snow that is . i ordered the coconut flavor with light condense milk and wafers . the coconut snow ice is cream and had good flavored , but the condense milk was way too sweet . for the small , it was only a few bites it done . for the price , it was not worth it for the amount you got . the food looked good , so i will be back to try the noodles and stuff .		3		0
wow the coffee is superb , there 's no doubt about that ! i got an iced dirty chai with rice milk -lrb- they were out of almond milk . bummer -rrb- . hubby got a cappuccino . excellent execution and flavor . but i just do n't feel comfortable here . service , while not rude , was not warm and definitely not friendly . i walked up to the counter and the guy basically stared at us . it was awkward . i also feel like it 's overpriced . my regular sized drink was $ 5.25 ! we usually like to chat a bit with the baristas or owners about their coffee and what not , but we were just not digging the vibe of this place . maybe because we had our kids with us that we kind of got the cold shoulder ? it 's not like we were staying and hanging out . i do n't know . coffee 5 stars for sure . but customer service/atmosphere i give that 1-2 stars .		3		0
3.5 stars located right next to the greene house -lrb- another fox restaurant concepts restaurant -rrb- . we got seated right away for dinner around 5:30 pm . although the table was small and very close to other tables , the restaurant was definitely `` homey ' enough for it not to be distracting . our server came to us with a plate of olives -lrb- which none of us ate unfortunately -rrb- we started with the bruschetta appetizer . prosciutto with asparagus and crescenza cheese . although pricey and portioned small , the flavors balanced each other well enough to satisfy the taste buds . after asking our server , we decided to split the strozzapreti dish : pesto sauce with pine nuts and crispy capers . add chicken for a little extra . the portions were perfect to be split . a hungry customer would 've definitely been able to finish a regular dish to themselves though . the dish was a little bit salty because of the capers . otherwise , very tasty . we asked for bread to neutralize the `` saucy-ness '' and they happily gave us two slices no charge . tiramisu for dessert . melt in your mouth . so good ! by the end of our dinner , the lighting was dimmer and the restaurant a bit louder . they do have an open kitchen which makes the restaurant a little more casual . my main complaint is in the small dining area , people stare at you and your food and it is sooo obvious . moreso because their tables are so close to yours , its as if you are sitting at one table but ... not really . happy hour can be enjoyed at the bar or the dining room . plenty of tables on the patio but the tables are again , pretty small .		3		0
ok . i was expecting to be wowed by this place . i wanted to be wowed ! but , i was n't . came here for restaurant week , and we all ordered off of the restaurant week menu . there were n't any options , at all really . the main course was lamb , and i am no lamb fan . but i went with it . the food was good . the food was inventive . i particularly liked the molecular gastronomy aspects to some of the dishes ! foam ! liquid nitrogen ! why i was n't wowed : - portion sizes were pretty small . one of the courses was a mini sloppy joe , and it was smaller than my husbands thumb fingernail . we 're not big eaters , but we did feel like we wanted more food after all was said and done . - service . i was offered a drink at the beginning of the meal , and by the second course i was out of drink . i was never offered another drink . i probably would have spent another $ 30 - $ 40 on cocktails , but was just never offered another drink . - ambiance . i did n't like it . i thought it was small , and very loud . after reading so many rave reviews , and knowing binkley was up for a james beard , i was just expecting to love love love it . and i did n't . for the money , i 'd rather go to kai .		3		0
grabbed some tacos on the way to my class today , after work . 2 fish tacos , 1 spicy chicken and 1 tea . iced tea was disgusting and i told them so , they agreed and actually dumped all of their remaining tea out . i have gotten no apology , but did get a refill with watered down horchata . tacos were alright . nothing really to write home about . just average good taco . does not qualify for a big deal in my book . stop by there or keep driving is totally up to you . if i were in your car i would have said - `` whatever '' .		3		0
this place definitely takes advantage of its surroundings , promoting its urban feel . it 's easily accessible from the light rail , sits right on the northern edge of downtown , is close to the public market and contributes to growing number of businesses in the area . its point-of-sale is a bit on the pricey side , but it 's a nice place regardless . if i were downtown and wanted coffee , this would be my preferred choice . if i wanted to go out for coffee in any neighborhood , i would likely bypass this shop for copper star , hob nob 's or the lux . patrons will notice fair trade 's odd use of angles , industrial interior and uv-heavy lighting with windows that seem to magnify the sun 's brightness . i do like it and would go back again , but in general it is n't my preference .		3		0
i have to give it to them - they did a nice job with this place . service is great , nice atmosphere . we sat at the bar for a couple of drinks and the bartender elizabeth was sweet , attentive and poured great drinks . our food was good , nothing special though . we had the bar snacks fondue and hummus to start . neither were impressive . i had the chicken for my main dish . the chiken was very moist and tender but the smoky flavor took over the whole dish and i coud n't taste the risotto or the nushroom . the other people at the table thought their dishes were good . but again - nothing amazing . overall we enjoyed our experience but will probably be back for the bar , not the restaurant .		3		0
wham bam and right out the door we went ! do n't get me wrong the food was pretty good . i had the lasagna and 2 pbrs -- yeah so what i 'm from the mid-west ! bread and appetizers were okay , but i had high expectations overall . need a table ? -- better reserve or make sure you have all your friends ready to seat . this place seems to have a high turnover rate - follow the orders - sit , order , mingle , eat , and get the heck out cause someone needs your table ! you know , after a plate of carbs i would like to sit for some time while my digestive system works , but apparently they do n't have time for that . our server was pretty cool and fun so kudos to meatball for making it a fun dinner experience regardless - enjoy !		3		0
definitely a good way to get a quick sushi fix . the sushi here is incredibly cheap compared to other restaurants with plates of 2-4 pieces for $ 1 - $ 2 . however , it might be better to consider the sushi here `` fast food sushi . '' the rolls are small and pretty basic overall , many are variants of the california roll with different items on top . i.e. california roll + chruncy topping = crunch roll + salmon = salmon roll + potato = mountain potato and so forth . the deep fried rolls are good if you can get them fresh , but by the time they come around the conveyor belt , that is often not the case . while i love the atmosphere and the simplicity of the dining experience , this is not the place to get real , authentic sushi . also , this restaurant is always packed . there was a waiting list to sit at 3 in the afternoon . as such , it can be difficult to get the waiter 's attention when you need a refill of water or the bill . all in all , a good restaurant at a good location .		3		0
i was overall happy with the food . we ordered the appetizer platter to try various things , and the only thing i did n't like was a hard round patty thing that was really dry . the variety of dips were great . i had the malai kofta -lrb- veggie & cheese balls deep fried , in a yummy yellow sauce -rrb- , and it was awesome . hubby had palak paneer -lrb- cheese & spinach sauce -rrb- , and i found it bland but he said it was ok . paratha stuffed with garlic was ok ... the garlic was bitter . i 've found garlic is bitter when it 's gone too old so i assume that 's what happened . service was weird . place was empty when we got there and the first person to the table laughed when i said we 'd order the appetizers while we look at the menu , which is just odd . there were about 4 different people coming to the table so i do n't know who our actual waiter was , but the only person that smiled and seemed friendly was the man who brought the food to the table . the rest were quiet and sort of like mannequins that moved . nothing was bad though , except for maybe the fly that kept landing on things . when we left , one of the employees -lrb- who was missing teeth and looked like a meth head -rrb- was begging the host/manager person to stop payment on his paycheck because he did n't use the account anymore . he said he owed money in the account , so if the check deposited , the bank would take the money . i thought this in really bad taste ... i really do n't want to know .		3		0
let me start by saying this place is n't bad ... it 's just not awesome . i went here on friday night with the bf for a date and to use a doozy deal coup . we made reservations on opentable , which got us the table , but oddly , instead of confirming that we went to the restaurant , they cancelled our reservation . this was kind of annoying because we did n't get our points , but it could have been an honest mistake . we tried a variety of food including : arancini , drunken cheesy bread , strands w meatballs , and minestrone soup . we also got drinks - i got the italian margarita and the bf got some white wine . his wine came out with cork or dust in it at first , but they replaced it when he told them . the marg was good , like an alcoholic slushee . the food was all pretty good ... the minestrone had lots of veggies , but was on the salty side . the bread was a bit odd ... did taste like wine , but i probably would n't order it again . the arancini were really good ! they had some pancetta in it and came with a really tasty lemony sauce and a marinara . i only wish there were more of them ! the ` strands ' were good and the meatballs were juicy . the service was friendly but slow . also , they brought all of our food out at the same time , which i did n't love because it made everything get cold before we got a chance to eat it ... do n't know why they would n't bring soup , then apps , then mains ... overall , it was good ... it just was n't great ... and i thought it was a bit overpriced . i would consider going back and giving them another try , especially for a happy hour or something .		3		0
this place is a real hidden gem ! in fact if you are distracted you will miss it over and over . a really tiny place and usually gets very busy . we were a group of 6 that because of the change in time with our reservation , some had to cancel . the unpleasant part -lrb- and the missing star -rrb- is that the owner will stare at us every time as if it was our fault . to enjoy better this place do n't go with a group larger than 4 . we had the fried noodles and yes , the salsas are worth trying . the bread with garlic is something i would n't order for it 's price , but my friend enjoyed it . i shared a chicken and waffle with one of my friends and gladly this portion was more than enough . i would n't fry that chicken . it is cooked in a good way and the meet is really tasty , the breeding comes like a crust and it becomes too much . the other dish that was tried is the mac & cheese . i really ca n't understand who orders this in a restaurant . my friend was a bit disappointed as he was dreaming of crispy prosciutto -lrb- never heard about this -rrb- and for him it was too tender . we also tried the rum and ginger ale , yes ! try it ! if there is a next time , i 'll make sure i do n't have a reservation so we can eat and enjoy our dinner .		3		0
china chili is one of those places you visit when you want something you know you 'll like and need to get in and out really quickly . i started working on central and indian school just around the time china chili closed prior to the lightrail construction , so my first experience was at the new place . i wish had gotten the opportunity to eat at the original location just to see if the experience was any better . i have ordered two things at china chili : the orange chicken and the sesame chicken . i only order the former now . i have never had to wait longer than five minutes for an order . this is good yet slightly unnerving . it makes me feel as though everything is ready-to-serve in the back , even though the freshness and temperature of the food says otherwise . the orange chicken is out of this world . an entire breast fillet is battered , deep-fried , sliced , and covered with a really delicious orange sauce . if you ask for it extra spicy , be prepared to feel your face melt off . the consistency of the heat level is a bit hit-or-miss , but when they get it right , you 'll be simultaneously pleased and in pain . my biggest beef with this place is the wait staff . very rarely is service pleasant . most of the waitresses are brusque and a bit too efficient for my liking . when the dining room is n't full , they tend to huddle up near the kitchen and watch the patrons as they eat , usually talking quietly amongst themselves . it is quite unsettling and makes me feel as though i 'm not welcome . the one exception is one of the very sweet older women who reminds me a bit of my grandma in that she always has a smile and is always so quick to ask if i need a refill . i do n't know her name , but i always hope she 's there when i go . so , visit china chili when you 're in a hurry and craving the best darn orange chicken you 'll ever have . also , beware of really terrible parking options .		3		0
more like a 3.5 . the food is good , but the gyro and cheesesteak my husband and i shared were a bit on the greasy side . although that is to be somewhat expected with gyro 's and cheesesteaks , i feel like they were greasier than gyros and cheesesteaks ought to be . however , i would not recommend their desserts . the service was also good . the reason why i did n't give this place 4 stars is because it did n't really stand out in comparison to other places like the phoenician -lrb- not during the summers -rrb- , but it was definitely better compared to places like oliveo . i think i will need to give this place another try , however . i will update as soon as i do .		3		0
ventured off to mi amigo 's with mi amigos for lunch today and had an a-ok pleasant experience . big place , nice size menu and pretty decent speed on bringing the food out -lrb- i was clock watching , since it was just a lunch break -rrb- . lunch prices are very reasonable . i had the veggie burrito . very tasty and very filing . zucchini , spinach , carrots , , peppers , rice etc. . loved the variety of the ingredients . mi amigos enjoyed their dishes as well . -lrb- yes you get free chips and salsa to start - i know you were thinking about it -rrb- . they have happy hour 3-6 and indoor/outdoor seating as well . overall . . pretty average food ... not bad and not the greatest . will it stop the rumbling in yo ' tummy without breaking your budget ? word .		3		0
love the french onion soup and carrot raisin muffins here . today we came after three and you could say the entire staff was out to lunch . we eventually seated ourselves at the bar , got our own menus too , was eventually greeted by someone who offered to get us drinks but again we were waiting for a server . did finally get service and our order placed and meal delivered in a timely manner . i had quiche with soup and a muffin and my son had the soup and sandwich . meal was fine as we had anticipated . bummed they do n't have a muffin included in the soup & salad option .		3		0
while i am a fan of the zoo , i 'm not a fan of how expensive it has gotten ! it is now $ 20/adult and $ 10/child from 3-12 years old . this does not include the stingray exhibit , carousel , or safari train which are extra . there is a `` premium '' admission which is $ 23/adult and $ 13/child which is n't advertised on the website but does include the stingrays , carousel , or safari train . even with the premium pricing , the camel ride , giraffe encounter , are all additional charges . the food is way over priced . that having been said , the zoo itself is beautiful . it 's very clean with friendly staff and nice , broad based exhibits . the petting zoo is very nicely done and it 's always a good visit . just be prepared to spend a pretty penny on a visit to the phoenix zoo . so as much as i 'd like to give it more stars , the phoenix zoo is pricing itself out of the market with the nickel diming that it 's doing to its guests .		3		0
i 'd love to rate this place on atmosphere alone , give it five stars , and call it a day . me and a friend were able to seat ourselves , and every spot looked so nice i had trouble picking a spot ! there were some huge , comfy chairs . very wide and low to the floor ; we felt like we were reclining with ample table space between us . the menu was already laid out , and i sat there admiring the playlist . franz ferdinand ... darwin deez ... it 's like they hacked into my pandora quickmix to lure me in ! my mojito was worth all nine dollars . it packed a punch , and was extra minty . other bars should try one here and take notes . we started off with the hummus appetizer because hummus pairs well with everything -lrb- duh -rrb- . i could n't get enough of the grilled flatbread , which i assume was seasoned with rosemary , sea salt , and crack . too bad most of the basket they give you is ... tortilla chips . and the hummus has the consistency and spice of a tex-mex bean dip . i do n't know how i feel about that . we started having second thoughts about eating at the only place to screw up hummus . the descriptions of sandwiches were painfully average . i just ca n't get excited about the `` local pepper jack '' motif . they boasted some brand of sushi that i have n't heard of , and i 'm sure it 's well-liked . but do you really want to order some off-site sushi when you can get it fresh within walking distance ? no disrespect , though . atmosphere is off the charts , and our waiter was super-cool . i 'll recommend this for a great day drinking spot , so it 's `` a-ok '' with me .		3		0
the food was tasty and the happy hour very reasonable , but my father ordered a rum and coke during happy hour and i think the drink cost 8 dollars . i was surprised to see how expensive it was on the tab . the well rum was captain morgan -lrb- not that good - 14 dollars a bottle -rrb- . so gallo charged 60 % of the bottle cost for a shot of rum . seriously ? the restaurant felt odd , but i ca n't put my finger on it . i probably will not return .		3		0
i am conflicted between two and four stars , so logically i went with three . i do love me some pei wei , for several reasons . they are usually very conveniently located , you can order online , everything is yummy , they are very consistent -lrb- what you had tasted last week will be the same the next -rrb- , and their quality is very good . they even have some options for reducing the calories on your favorite entrees . that being said i am clearly a fan , however this location has let me down a few times . nothing major , you just might want to double check your bag before leaving with your take out . i requested some soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce to go with my food , he assured me they were in the bag , i took his word for it , went on my way and was very disappointed when i got home , mouth watering from the smell that enveloped my car , and saw no sauce , of either flavor . i was out out of soy sauce at home , so my rice was a little sad . i am not a huge fan of their sweet and sour sauce anyhow , so that was n't a huge let down . my faves are the lettuce wraps -lrb- duh ! -rrb- , crab wontons -lrb- very crabby , fake krab but whatev -rrb- , honey seared chicken -lrb- sweet -rrb- , mongolian beef -lrb- green onions are great -rrb- , and jon likes the sweet and sour chicken -lrb- good veggies -rrb- .		3		0
i 've seen this place for a couple of years now , but did n't drop in until yesterday . so we ordered the short ribs -lrb- i was told it was the house specialty -rrb- and chicken fried steak . chicken fried steak was good . oddly its served with a brown gravy . the veggies that came with it were very good . garlic mashed potatoes were half way decent . the short ribs came with butter nut squash hash , greens -lrb- spinach -rrb- and some of the braising liquid . the dish was ok . the braising liquid did n't really add much to the dish and the butternut squash has was so so . the greens were good . overall the dish was missing something . i expect we 'll go back again , but i 'm pretty sure i wo n't order the short ribs .		3		0
when we arrived we were told there was a 45 minute wait . i looked around at all the empty tables ... hmm . . so where are all these people and where are they waiting ? she points me next door to a really cool and swanky lounge . i could n't tell if this was an extension of the restaurant or a separate entity . either way it was pretty cool . we sat down and ordered a drink , then not 5 minutes later the hostess came in and told us table was ready . now i ca n't really complain that our 45 minute wait turned in to a 5 minute wait , but honestly with all the empty tables in the place it felt as if they were trying to turn people away . the starter bread was fresh and the pesto was divine . we ordered the eggplant rollatini to start and were sorely disappointed at the mushy mess placed in front of us . it had the consistency of soggy enchiladas and try as i might i could not find eggplant through all the cheese . i ordered a salad and it was forgotten , i asked for it again after we got our main and it was forgotten . the main was a cavatelli something : pasta , tomatoes , bell pepper , onion and sausage . it was decent , but i could have made it better myself at home . we also ordered a $ 32 bottle of pinot noir . now i know that there is a huge mark up on bottles of wine , but please take the aj 's $ 7.99 price tag off before putting it down in front of me . 3 stars for venue alone . the patio absolutely rocks and the new lounge next door is great for after dinner cocktails . the food and service need a little work , but i 'll probably come back and try the pizza .		3		0
i 've been here twice now . initially , i was impressed at the management of a huge table -lrb- we had like 20 people -rrb- and the waitress had no problem doing separate checks and was quick upon return with the checks and change . yet when i went with just another person , although crowded , the service was not that great . the one thing that was odd - some food came out fairly quickly , yet others ' orders took forever . some of my friends waited about 20 minutes after everyone else received their dishes , and it 's not like they ordered something totally different . in fact , some of the orders were identical to the other friends . then again , we did have 20 people . during the time i was just with another person , it was a similar thing - my food came out way earlier than my friend 's . i ordered the summer rolls that were quite tasty , and the prices were very reasonable . i ordered miso soup and edamame which were both delicious . my mom ordered the pad thai and loved it . i was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food one could order for a decent price . the parking could likely get to be a problem . i managed to find a spot , but during busier hours with the other surrounding businesses , i imagine it would be messy . also , the only other negative thing was that my mojito was really not that tasty .		3		0
i love this place . if i could i would swing by every morning , but when i do have time and want something super yum-o , i get my tosh over here . the drive thru is awesome -lrb- its so nice to have an alternative to sbux ! -rrb- the staff has always been super friendly , the food is yum ! and you have tons of options -lrb- which i love ! -rrb- i have only been inside once and the place is pretty cute . the blender is a little loud , so its not the ideal place to be if you need to work etc. . but still its adorable . i usually get the breakfast club , no bacon on a sesame seed bagel and a large coffee , its so good ... in fact , im heading over there right now to get my fix : -rrb- see you there my darlings !		3		0
i want to like five guys burgers , i really do . my first experience with them was n't really anything special . i do enjoy the fact that they make the burgers the way you want them too , but the ingredients going into the burger is nothing special . also , the way they stack the burger is what kills it for me . by putting the mushrooms and onions on the bottom of the double patties , it kind of melts the bottom bun , which was a big bummer for me . the meat was n't spiced at all , but tasted fresh , which gives them some points . as for the potatoes , i do n't really care where they come from , so having a sign to tell us where they come from seems kind of pointless . we got the cajun spiced fries , which the wife did n't enjoy , but i liked . they tasted frozen though , which was kind of a let down . edit : just found out they always use fresh potatoes ... did n't taste fresh . other than that , you do get plenty of food for the price , and the decor is nice . staff was great . i might try again , but with smashburger and fatburger around , i might not .		3		0
i ordered our tickets online , but what really happens when you get there , they charge your credit card and you sign the credit slip there and receive your tickets . the seats where really huge and i could n't reach the floor . when i reclined , i could sense the feet from the people behind me . we occupied two seats on the right side , premium area . you would think that they would have a tray to go between us ... nope ... we had separate swing out tables . the sound system was excellent and the popcorn was okay . this is something that i would do every once in a while . if there is a movie that you really want to see , this is the place to reserve your seat .		3		0
i ca n't believe it 's taken me 4,762 visits to this oregano 's to finally get my lazy ass to type out a review of this place . perhaps it 's the overall indifference , and everyday-ness quality to this place that explains . food -- 3 stars service -- 3.5 stars atmosphere -- 4 stars parking -- 1 star oregano 's is n't bad nor terribly good -- but it falls in the middle as an average lunch or dinner option . portions here are big , but quanity does not equal quality . i find it to be infinitely better than most other italian chains -lrb- the barfy olive garden , macaroni grill and carrabba 's -rrb- , but not quite at the level of maggiano 's or il fornaio . the food here is ok , although there are a few standouts . * alfredo the dark pasta with the poblano peppers . * lady is a scampi pasta * pizza cookie -lrb- or whatever it 's called -rrb- * italian fried potatoes btw , that last item is their cutesy name for waffle fries . being the waffle fry whore that i am , i have to say these are quite good . the baked sandwiches are ok -- the beefstro and stuffed turkey being one of my usual orders . the pizza is ok as well . being a thin crust lover , i find the crust at pizza heaven and pizzeria bianco to have a better-tasting texture . it 's almost a little too thin -lrb- read : cheap -rrb- here . kind of like notebook paper . how do i know ? because i 've tried it . the salads here are big , so be warned . ca n't comment on the taste though because i have n't had them . the 1950s swing/jazz motif , tomato sauce cans , and loud t-shirts can be charming in a campy kind of way . but what i like most about this location is how they preserved the `` damen/herren '' bathroom signs from when it used to be some kind of bavarian wonderland . among the cons here are the parking nightmare and sometimes hellish 1 hour-plus waits -lrb- on mondays even ! -rrb- . this place is always packed . i do not understand why there are only 15 parking spots here for a restaurant that easily seats over 100 . they must expect all their customers to carpool together in mini-vans . but even so , they should know that no one in central phoenix would be caught dead in a mini-van . the parking shortage has caused nearby businesses to post bitchy signage warning oregano 's patrons not to park there - resulting in the traffic boobytrap that is 10th st. drivers must dodge slowly moving cars and waddling oregano 's customers weave in and out as the tiny parking lot leaks out onto 10th . staff here is always quick and freakishly friendly and cheery -- kind of like the drones at jamba juice and cold stone creamery . it 's kind of cute , but borderline annoying that it seems trite . but there are plenty of a-holes at other restaurants so i 'm not complaining . so there you have it . not exactly great , but i will be back soon . visit 4,763 is coming up next week . p.s. for stalkers who care , phoenix fire department does eat here often . in fact when melinda sees a fire engine parked outside she always requests a table close to the firefighters . she thinks those guys are `` en fuego .

my first time here i was like , `` hey this place is the bomb '' and all happy about my experience . the 2nd time i went , it did not go as well . it made me a little embarrassed i had talked the place up ! the front door staff seemed confused on how to charge our credit card . a manager told my friends smoking on the patio before 9:30 was not allowed . we left the patio and i watch 5 people smoke there and the guy said nothing to them . when we came back to the patio , my husband reached over the side to grab his drink when we were obviously on our way back onto the patio and the same guy who was picking and choosing who got to smoke yelled at my husband for drinking off the patio . it had n't even been taken off the patio or drunk yet ! i 'm not trashy , i 'm not an idiot , and i do n't like being nit picked every 2 seconds when i 'm out . if i have to follow the rules , everyone else should too . maybe i did n't wear enough hipster chic that night ? beer selection is ok . food was ok . indoor venue gets 4 stars . parking is sometimes tricky . all in all i 'll probably be back . i 'll just expect less .		3		0
we had a groupon . with that deal , the place is totally worth it . decent happy hour ; tasty pizzas . i definitely am curious to try their other pizza variations . we got sop and the pear one . both tasty . the downsides ? if we did n't have the groupon , it would be a bit costly for the amount of pizza you get . also , because they 're wood-fired , it does n't seem like the crust can hold too many toppings . the biggest downside , though , is the atmosphere . they pack you into this place like sardines ! i will go back because , like i said , i 'm curious about the other specialty pizzas . but i might be waiting til there 's another groupon .		3		0
why is it so hard to find some good fried ball of fun , aka falafel . i rolled on in here with a coworker on our adventure lunch trip for the week . we were relived that we were not the only customers or outsiders when we showed up . we picked the table of our choice and were given the menus a few minutes later . the menu had many vegetarian dishes including a sampler plate , for lunch the prices of the dish items was a bit high $ 8.95 . many of the menu items had recently undergone a crude price charge with a label maker . we waited a bit until they came to take our order . if you read any of my reviews it should be no surprise that i went for the falafel sandwich . the sandwiches came with either a salad or soup . i oped for the salad , it was a basic mix of ice burg lettuce with diced tomatoes and cucumber dressed with a light balsamic dressing . our sandwiches arrived after another 10 minutes . during that wait we took in the interesting , whimsical , tacky decor . floral paintings , painted cornice upon cornice moldings , and a iraq clock . my falafel sandwich was basic , falafel , lettuce , a picked and tahini . it was decent , the falafel was soft inside and had a good flavor . the size was a bit small considering the $ 5.25 price . the service was a bit slow , and we oped to get up and pay at the register as we could not wait any longer . the food was decent the service and prices were not so only awarded 3 stars .		3		0
my co-workers and i like to come here on taco tuesdays for their $ 1 tacos . you can order either chicken , steak or beef tacos , -lrb- 3 taco minimum -rrb- for a dollar , and you get a side of fresh tortilla chips and you get to choose from their salsa bar . the chicken tacos are definitely the best , the chicken is flame-broiled and you definitely get that flame-broil flavor . they are on double corn tortillas which is a bit much for me , i can never eat more than two -lrb- which is why the three taco minimum kind of sucks , but who can beat $ 3 for lunch with leftovers ? -rrb- . the steak tacos are nothing compared to the chicken , the steak just is n't very flavorful , i definitely would not recommend them . i have never tried the beef , which come on a crisp taco shell . i tend to prefer soft tacos over hard tacos , so i have n't really been interested in trying the beef . i think the rest of the menu tends to be a bit expensive for what you get . i would n't really recommend coming to chico 's unless its for the dollar tacos . the chips and salsa bar is pretty great . lots of different types of salsa with varying levels of kick . this is a great place to come for a cheap , fast , working lunch !		3		0
my girlfriend and i came here late christmas night just to grab a quick drink after a drive around . i was surprised that this place was even open . there was a lot of parking since everyone was more than likely either home sleeping or with family and friends . the place was n't empty inside but there was probably a half a dozen to a dozen people inside including staff . the place had like four to six pool tables . the tables are in decent shape ... we got the table right by the door which surprisingly ate the cue ball and so the bartender had to snaggle it out by dropping a few balls into the pocket it went into . the cue sticks have seen better days . the patrons there looked like your usual rag tag bunch . a few looks pretty ghetto but whatever , nobody bothered us even though we stuck out like a sore thumb . i got a few shots and drinks and she got some wine . we played pool for a while . the service was n't fast , fast even with lack of customers but it was fast-decent . drinks were alright priced . i would come back here again but i would n't want to come when it 's packed . i remember passing by here once a long time ago and seeing a guy fight a tranny in front . i thought that was hilarious ! trust me , it was . you have to had been there to see this .		3		0
for as much as i love pizza , california pizza kitchen somehow misses the mark with me . it just lacks that `` something '' that makes me want to keep coming back as a chain . when date guy and i arrived , we were warmly greeted by the staff and we requested a booth . it was sunday night , and it was a rather quiet low key evening , so the restaurant was not exceptionally busy . for whatever reason , we were seated in a huge booth that was meant for 6 people . there were several other open booths that were meant for a normal party of 2 . why were we sat at the booth of 6 ? no idea . go figure . anyways , we had a foccacia appetizer and it was amazing ! loved it ! best thing ever ! but , patrick 's mojito was n't quite up to par , so we asked the server and she fixed it . i guess there was hardly any mint in it and it tasted weird . -lrb- i hardly drink , but i will take his word for it . -rrb- anyways , i got the santa fe chicken pizza and it was fine . i do n't remember what patrick got , but he was happy with his food as well . we passed on dessert and stuck around for a bit . i really liked our server , as she was professional and handled herself wonderfully , but service was kind of slow . i do n't know if they were short staffed , but at one point i was dying of thirst and out of pop , so i walked to the bar to get a new drink , and was told that one would be out in a second . it was , but i think the poor girl was overwhelmed . anyways , i would return to eat here , no problem . not a bad experience .		3		0
to mine and my friend 's surprise , this past wednesday was my first visit to radio cafe . i think the chaos of that street corner always turned me away from stopping in . my initial reaction was pure shock , i had no idea that this place was so big . even though it mirrors the chelsea 's , postino style , i totally appreciate their uber chic lighting and spacious design . my friend was waiting for me on the patio and it was a pleasant surprise ; i kept staring back into the restaurant and gawking at the scene , this place is really beautiful . what a perfect pick for a happy hour on a gorgeous day ! we were quickly greeted by a friendly and attentive server who eagerly volunteered their happy hour specials -lrb- 1/2 off all drinks ! -rrb- i am not typically a rum drinker , but the perfect weather and scene begged me to order a mojito . my friend ordered wine and both were delivered quickly , along with requested water . mojito was meh and i could barely finish it - but i think i chalk that up to me not really being a sweet drink/rum person . it seemed perfectly mixed . we were n't really going to order anything to eat but just had to try the deviled eggs . hindsight , we should 've left the mystery in our head because a place known for sushi really should n't have deviled eggs on their menu . the presentation was a stunner - they looked so inviting with their crispy bacon bits . but their delivery was so much less and oddly warm - which was n't expected . all in all , it was a really pleasant experience that night and the service was top notch - she even gave us a `` last call '' for happy hour , which is totally appreciated . however , my first conversation with my friend today started something like this '' ... so did you have belly issues after you went home last night ? '' yeah , turns out maybe those stupid little eggs leave a mark . i 'll totally be back , just maybe sticking to the drink and staying far , far away from those damn eggs .		3		0
i consider myself somewhat of an expert on mortons . if i was on island -lrb- home -rrb- , i ate a the honolulu restaurant every saturday from jun 2007 to may 2011 . since that time the restaurant has been sold to landrys . so what did i notice today when i went there tonight . first , maitre d and manager were n't wearing tuxedos any more . given that landrys recently bought mccormick and schmicks and closed the phx location in addition to the phx mortons , i think there 's a serious change afoot . how does this reflect on quality ? perhaps to early to say . but on the other hand cutting away at something as small as management in tuxedos may seem inconsequential , i can guarantee you that there will be 2nd and 3rd order effects that will impact food quality . now having said all of the above we ate in the bar . ordered the sliders , blt crab sandwiches , mini wedge salad and a bowl of lobster bisque . i was all good reflected pretty much what we had in hawaii over the last 4 years . having said that , i will go out on a limb here and say that if the tuxedo cutting culture makes it 's way into the kitchen , then i predict one of the first casualties will be the crab cakes . good crab cakes are hard , and expensive to make . cheap or cheaper ones are easier . but it you 're cutting out tuxedos ... a very visible sign of the restaurant ... it will be very easy to make cheaper crab cakes .		3		0
the old spaghetti factory is by far my guiltiest pleasure . lets face it the food is n't that great , and on more then 5 occasions i have been here and it seemed like the entire bussing staff was on a smoke break . growing up in the willo district as a child my mother took me to the spaghetti factory alot . i remember sitting in the trolly and the entire 86-88 suns team was in the building `` helping '' out . signing autographs and what not . sure was fun as a kid . now that i 'm older i just have those memories to make me say this place is n't all bad . the mizthra cheese and butter on some noodles is still delish . the meat sauce is decent to great . the pesto ranch dressing is pretty good . . to bad the lettuce is either still soaking wet , or dry and disgusting . as a phoenix institution for decades i wish this place was better . maybe someday someone will come in and turn it around . . but as a `` chain '' restuarant i do n't see that happening . either way . . for nostalgia i 'll still eat here on a quirky whim . but i will not go out of my way to eat here .		3		0
tapas papa frita is a good place for tapas . location and decor is great , you 'll like the patio , the ambience , the service . we 've tried it twice , once by ourselves for lunch and once with a party of eight for dinner . there was plenty of variety to the tapas menu , and most were ok -- worth an occasional visit -- but nothing really thrilled us . same thing for the entrees . most were ok but not memorable . the paella was the dreadful exception . i had the paella de pollo , and a friend had the paella valenciana . they may as well have been rice soup . very watery and none of the crispy scrapings that makes paella so good .		3		0
this is the very popular phoenix location of a restaurant chain , with 32 locations , 23 of them in texas . the faire is mostly cajun , so gulf type seafood dishes , blackened spices , and texas size portions are in the norm . this location gets jammed packed , and you will wait 45 minutes if you are there after 6:00 pm . they do have a number call system . the mains are solid choices with nice side dishes . this is not high brow food , but it is a good meal and a place to go with friends to drink , laugh and yak , as it gets pretty loud at peak times for anything else .		3		0
i knew sweet tomatoes was a pretty major chain , and i 've visited other locations before , but i just learned that there are 112 restaurant locations in 15 states ... that 's pretty huge ! this location happens to be a lunchtime favorite for my friend kathy l , since it 's close to our office , so we headed over here recently for a filling , somewhat healthy , affordable lunch ... bonus : kathy brought coupons that she found online which discounted each of our meals to just $ 6.99 ! we both stuck primarily to the salad bar although i have to admit , the soups , potatoes , pasta , pizzas , breads , muffins , and ice cream were pretty appealing as well . so , the lettuce is a tad bit watery , but the buffet has plenty to choose from and everything is fresh , chilled , and kept clean . staff is friendly as well ... this place is not for anyone looking for a classy place to dine , but if you 're hungry and looking to eat on the cheap in a casual environment , sweet tomatoes to the rescue !		3		0
my same friend `` forced '' me to see another film at this theater , and i had to upgrade my rating to be fair . i have to admit that i had a great experience seeing a film in theater # 2 at this place this weekend . it was a big normal size theater and the seats were clean and very comfortable . i still felt like i was on a cruise boat due to the demographics . the place still only gets three stars because some of the theaters are too tiny .		3		0
my first impressions of this place is that they try too hard . it 's almost completely void of the quirky character of a place like casey moore 's or four peaks . normal selection of beers , some good and some not so good . i like hoppy beers but their ipa was waaaay too hoppy for my tastes . i did n't eat anything this time but the menu offerings looked fine . i would like to try the kobe burger , i saw one go by us and it looked very good , maybe next time .		3		0
i had tried five guys on one of the very first days i got to tempe because my boyfriend had heard people rave about it so much . i did n't write a review of it then because i honestly forgot how what i thought about it . but now that i 've tried it again , i remember how not memorable it was . admittedly , the burgers are really good . they come with a huuge variety of dressing , sauces , vegetables , and other granishes , so you can have your burger any way you like it . the normal size burgers have 2 burger patties , so if you 're like me and are just used to the real normal one-patty burger , opt for the `` little '' hamburger , even though it 's really not little at all . the hamburger did taste really good and there 's malt vinegar that adds to the glorious messiness of eating a burger , but really , i do n't think it 's any better than any other burger place - including in-n-out . they have unlimited peanuts , but i 'm meh about peanuts . um ... their fries are good , but again , not too special . i would go back , but i do n't think i 'd ever crave going back .		3		0
i find myself here too often . sure its pretty nice inside , the workers are all pleasant and most of the parking spaces are covered -lrb- a huge plus and other markets should take the hint -rrb- . i just feel that most of their prices are a bit high and their selection lacks in some areas . i do n't do a whole lot of real shopping here but i do stop in from time to time to get some food from their deli thing . it is just eh ' and takes forever especially around lunch time . i 've tried just about every sandwich they have and find them all just ok and a bit over priced . i just tried the grilled portobello sandwich this weekend and it was no bueno . i think whole foods is far superior and wish this place would turn into one .		3		0
my introduction to japanese cooking occurred years ago in norwalk , calif. . it had been a grueling day and i wanted to get away , so i hopped in the car and started driving until i saw a storefront with a line out the door . after waiting for about 15 minutes i pointed to the picture on the wall . having no idea what it was , i had ordered tempura udon . i dunked one of the thick shaggy pieces of shrimp into the savory broth and watched as the tempura quickly soaked up the broth . the flavors were ethereal . my initial slurp of thick slippery udon is among the great food experiences i 've ever had . unfortunately , i 've never had udon that has compared to that first steaming bowl . after driving by cherry blossom noodle cafe in phoenix many times , i finally stopped in . they excel at their namesake with tasty noodles and more offerings than you can shake a wet noodle at . it 's a calming space with a quick , friendly wait staff and a menu that 's mostly asian inspired . there 's a section dedicated to italy , though i 'm not sure how much curry and ginger italians use in their pasta . cherry blossom also offers many salads , including tokyo chicken coleslaw -lrb- $ 7.60 -rrb- . it 's essentially a chinese chicken salad with grilled chicken , cabbage , lettuce and daikon sprouts in a tangy vinaigrette dressing . it 's deliciously light and refreshing . a friend once told me that the spiciness of a spicy sushi roll was invented to help disguise the flavor of fish that might not be so fresh . while i 'm not saying that the spicy salmon roll -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- was n't freshly made , it was so fishy that it was inedible . spicy as it was , it could n't disguise the flavor that remained with me after the first try . the california roll -lrb- $ 4.40 -rrb- fared better , but then again it was just a california roll , imitation crab , cucumber and avocado wrapped in rice . moving right into noodles , the egg version used in the korean spicy beef -lrb- $ 10.50 -rrb- were so chewy and fun to eat , i only wished the bowl was larger . spiked with green peppers and tender sliced of beef , this was n't as spicy as i has hoped , but this was quickly remedied with a side of chile paste . my eyes widened as my ebi-ten udon noodle -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- arrived . it was a large bowl filled with huge udon noodles paired with soup and steamed spinach . along side were several pieces of shrimp tempura that were golden and inviting . could this be what i 've been searching for all of these years ? after one sip my hopes plunged ; just not quite the same . the flavor of the dashi , the basic soup stock used for udon , was a little too strong . do n't get me wrong , it was a very good bowl but , not quite the sensation i experienced so many years ago . perhaps it 's never as good as the first time .		3		0
this restaurant has been open for about 7 months in my old ` hood in scottsdale in the sonora shopping mall off the 101 and flw between the best buy and staples . the restuarant has a sister location in mesa . the owners are thai . the decor is clean , neat , almost quaint , and without a lot of thai decorative influences . they do play a sort of ttradional thai melodies meets new age relaxation type cd , and it is relaxing . i came for lunch . they run 10 lunch specials for $ 6.95 , which includes a side salad of romaine and carrot strips with a light soy/sesame dressing . to satisfy the mostly caucasian scottsdale neighborhood , the choices are part chinese -lrb- orange chicken , kung pao -rrb- , japanese -lrb- chicken teriyaki -rrb- and thai -lrb- pad thai , panang -rrb- . i had panang chicken curry , which came with your choice of fried or steamed rice -lrb- steamed jasmine -rrb- . the curry comes in your preferred spice level from 1 to 5 . pick 3 , which is about right for most . the curry had a nice flavor , with nice small pieces of chicken with juliened red bell peppers . i added a thai iced tea to drink for $ 2 . they have the usual colors of curries , all about $ 10 , soups like tom yum koong , salads like yum woon sen , larb , and papaya , and noodles like pad thai , pad se ew , and rad nar . a bit americanized , but tasty and very reasonable . there are few choices for thai in scottsdale , so if you have craving , try this one .		3		0
this french-american restaurant and lounge presents a chic and modern vibe . what i like about the setting is that it has an open kitchen so you really feel a part of the restaurant and watch the chef in action if you sit in that area . however this flashy atmosphere did n't have the great food i would expect from the setting . here 's a breakdown of what i liked and did n't like about the food selections . no appetizers were ordered . however the chef offered us a complimentary duck pate for starters . the duck pate was good and simple and had a rich flavor . however it was complemented with a very strong mustard sauce and very lemony salad . the mustard seed with olive oil sauce was too overpowering for the light duck pate . and the salad did n't seem it was mixed well . the vinaigrette on the salad tasted like lemon juice . for the main course , we had a lamb shank and filet mignon . we also ordered a potato au gratin as well for the side dish . the lamb shank was the best main course . lamb shanks can be cooked with a light meat taste or heavier like in this case . the gamey taste of the shank complemented well with the mushroom risotto sauce . the meat came off the bones just beautifully . be sure to complement the dish with a more medium to full-bodied wine . the medium rare filet mignon was disappointing . it was overcooked in parts of the filet and the texture was off . sometimes i felt like i was gnawing at the meat . the peppercorn sauce just did n't fit well with the dish . it would 've been better if there was n't any sauce at all . i 've just had better filets before . the potato au gratin came out beautifully . parmesan cheese and cream mix made the light and moist . adding cream really made the difference and i could even eat it after it was cooled down . now on to the dessert . we choose their signature cheesecake . this is n't what you would normally expect from a cheesecake . it was garnished with a champagne honey sauce , light layer of almonds , fresh strawberries , and a decorative sugar piece . the cheesecake itself was awesome . however i could n't stand the sweet champagne honey sauce . eating that sauce with the cheesecake felt like eating sugar with a cheesecake texture . overall opinion , flashy , but not so much substance . especially for the price we paid . most of the dishes were ok , but the complementary elements like the sauces made the dishes worse . the main thing i would like to see is that the chef would make sure that every element of the dish will work well together .		3		0
ok , so here 's the deal . the griddlecakes here are delicious . and i mean good . everything else is not so good ... i found that out this morning . so we waited for awhile and were seated in the back of the little room , not the one with the kitchen . the roof was leaking right next to us from the rain last night and it kind of smelled weird . also , the service was not so good ... we asked for cream and never got it ... asked again ... finally got it . and this coffee needs it badly ... so bad . and i 'm still mad they stopped serving cream and started serving some fat free garbage . so anyway , i went with the bf for breakfast and he was getting the griddlecakes and i did n't want to get the same thing as him so i ordered the salami scramble . that thing was inedible . it had so much salami that was so fatty ... the only thing i could taste was fat . not pleasant . and the salami 's texture was really chewy and weird too ... the home fries that come with it are good , the toast is not so great ... came with blueberry preserves which was also not great . however , go get the griddlecakes . they are awesome . i just ca n't say a place is four stars when only one thing is five stars and everything else is like 2 . so there ya go . go get some of delicious grandma 's griddlecakes of awesomeness . skip everything else . update : the bf and i went again today ... what a disappointment . his bacon was waaay too peppery ... like he did n't eat it , it was inedible . ugh . we waited over an hour and got seated at the counter ... pretty lame . got the hotcakes ... they were still good , but i just do n't think i 'll be back here anytime soon . sorry guys .		3		0
every time i get the opportunity to eat at place that can remind me of my madreland i 'm always a sucker to try it . most times i 'm not impressed because ... see review for all the other mexican places i have ventured but other times it 's a great experience and treat . meantime i decided to go out with my team and we looked forward to this awesome atmosphere and restaurant located in old town snobsdale . we made reservations and ended up with lauren our server for the night . we ordered appetizers like the guacamole and the cheese plate . the guacamole was good but nothing beyond what other local joints can do and i was not impressed with the portion which was very small . the cheese plate was not my favorite . we kept getting pushed to hurry and order and we were still having cocktails and waiting for another member . the server said if there was any chance we can call our friend to order her food because they needed to serve more guest ?? what the french ! did we just get checked at a high end restaurant and were told to hurry up ?! by the time we got our food i was really annoyed . here i am bringing out my team and although i understand you have a busy place , get over yourself and make sure your hostess does n't seat us if we do n't have a party versus making such a classless move . foul ! the food was okay but my experience just bummed me out . i talked to the manager , brian and he said it was a tough balance and hoped we can understand . we will see whether i would ever do this again . it 's not like i do this every once in a while , i 'm out and about all the time . boo		3		0
average to great sushi and i eat a lot of sashimi and sushi . do get the sake sampler if you like sake , you 'll get a rack of sake that 'll feed your senses and get you ready for a raw fish treat . presentation is pretty nice , service is very good and the outside patio is a nice place to eat ... i 've never sat inside , what for , we live in arizona , its nice out side ! lots of unusual rolls and the tempura is pretty good too . sashimi is very nice , get a combo plate and save a few bucks .		3		0
i am with jamie c. on this one . i think maybe i will have to come back to make my final decision . our server was great ! i wish i would have got his name so i could mention him by name ... very attentive ! i enjoyed the 2 glasses of sangria i had , but michael was not that enthused about his mojito . he switched to stella for his second : -rrb- . for our entrees we shared the calamari and their special which was a blue corn chicken enchilada . the calamari was very tasty ! i really liked the sauces that came with them and we ate it all ! the enchiladas were very tasty too . there were many shared plates that i wanted to try so i will definitely come back !		3		0
this was my second time dining there and my third time there altogether -lrb- the other visit , i had cocktails . -rrb- i have to say , when i went 4 years ago , i was very unimpressed with the eatery . i felt like it was overpriced for the small portions served and way too dark . you might think that 's romantic , but judging by how loud it gets , it was a weird dynamic for me . this dining experience was far better -lrb- despite our server taking more than 10 minutes to greet us . -rrb- he made up for it by suggesting items on the menu and being diligent the rest of the night , and the atmosphere was a little more relaxed than i remember . what stands out most to me about the decor is the sprawling wine bottle display that goes up to the ceiling . i also like the pretty hanging lights and big bar that greets you as soon as you walk in . for my first course of my meal , i had the hummus and pita bread . i was n't a huge fan of the pickled onion on top of the hummus , but the hummus itself was good . the pita bread was a little dry , but it was nice to have a healthy option for a starter , and overall , i enjoyed it . for my second course , i had handmade pasta , and instead of the veal ragu , i got a butter parmesan sauce to make it vegetarian . the sauce was so , so good , and you should request it , too . for dessert , i had a coffee creme brulee with hazlenut biscotti . i really liked the taste of it , and it was so creamy , but i found it sort of odd that our table sampled many desserts , and they all came out in perfect circle shapes . it made me think they were all pre-made , and that was a turn-off . overall , though , i was very satisfied with the meal , though olive & ivy can get pretty pricey for average-quality food .		3		0
okay , so first let me preface this by saying that i am not quite sure i understand the clothes mixed with food concept . i had lunch here during the week with two friends . you basically order at a counter -lrb- or you can actually eat at the counter -rrb- , pay and then have your food brought to you . overall , our experience was pleasant , but the company was better than the food . there is n't too much selection -lrb- a few salads and a few sandwiches , with the option for hot or cold -rrb- , which could be a turn off for some . i had a pretty decent turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce , but it was nothing to write home about . it was just another turkey sandwich . i also tasted the soup , which again , was average . they have wine , but i am not quite sure why since it 's the kind of place where you eat fairly quickly ... not really a dine and wine at lunch kind of spot . i did n't get the sense that this place had really decided what direction to go in , and the shopping while dining thing distracted me . it 's fine for a quick lunch while you 're shopping at kierland , but do n't go out of your way !		3		0
beckett 's table was on my `` must try it '' list after reading reviews and seeing the creative menu and the beautiful wine list . the service and atmosphere was excellent , but the food was nothing to write home about . it was surprisingly boring and did n't give me the wow factor i was looking for . we started with the grilled cheese appetizer , the grilled cheese was just a grilled cheese and the tomato soup was flavorless . my husband ordered a burger the brioche bun was dry and the burger was okay . i ordered the short ribs and it was the best thing we ordered , but i could make it at home . i ca n't say i would go back again . i have a rule ; if i can make it better at home i wo n't come back .		3		0
this place used to be `` our gang '' . not much has changed . i still adore their outdoor `` garden '' area which makes me nostalgic for little italy . the bread comes out hot and fresh , you can dip it in a nice pesto . the salad caprese is standard , nothing mind blowing , the chicken parmagiano will hit the spot if that is what you are craving . i will say that the pizza `` 4 ways '' is good , but not terrific . everything seemed to need a little salt , or some red pepper or some kick . however , this is a great little neighborhood place for when you want to go out for italian but do n't want something super fancy .		3		0
i moved to the phoenix area about 5 months ago and have been wanting to go to rustler 's ever since . i heard that the restaurant had a great view of the valley and was ideal for sunsets . i finally got to go recently and i was kind of disappointed . first , parking was strange . the restaurant is on a hill and there was limited parking at the top near the restaurant and so there 's additional parking down the hill , which you either trek up/down by foot or take a shuttle . second , i was expecting a romantic atmosphere but there were kids running around every where and even a slide for them inside . third , the food was expensive and not that great . the food reminded me of the food you get at a buffet . the place felt mainly like a tourist attraction and is something you only do once . however , the view was nice , the restaurant had an old west feel with a live band and they give you free cotton candy at the end of your meal .		3		0
decent stir fry for this type of place . not my favorite type of food , but it got the job done . i liked being able to choose your starch , including cabbage if you 're low-carbing it , and the servings were pretty generously-sized . plus you have the option to make it bottomless for an extra $ 5 apiece or so . the sauces seemed bland , but maybe i did n't mix mine like i should have . service was ... odd . not bad considering it was pretty crowded . our waiter was super friendly , but when we went up to fix our plates the servers bussed and cleaned our table . it was all cleared off when we went back , and the waiter was as confused as we were . it made me glad i had taken my purse up with me , and glad there were n't people sitting at our table when we came back . the whole place was a bit loud for my liking , but between the crowds , the fans , and the sounds of cooking that is n't really surprising .		3		0
apparently what used to be maloney 's in old town is now mulligan 's . truth be told , i do n't think anyone can tell the difference . this place is still too cramped all of the time , just like its predecessor . do n't get me wrong , i do n't dread going here and still do from time to time , but i always have the same complaint . there is just not enough room to manuever inside without pouring your drink all over the place -lrb- `` all over the place '' = `` jake 's pants '' -rrb- . i 'm guilty , too . they either need to let less people in or change the layout because ordering and receiving a drink takes way too long and carrying it away from the bar is damn near impossible .		3		0
my wife and i went here last night at about 7pm . the place was eerily dead . there were probably 4 other people in the entire place . i know the saying , `` nobody likes to eat in an empty restaurant '' , but we did n't care and decided to give this place a try . for many reasons , i really really really do not enjoy giving sub-par reviews so i will try to be gentle and concentrate on what i liked sprinkled with a few things that could be improved upon . if i had to rate a place only on decor , bathrooms and stickiness of my table ; this place would not do very well . good thing i was here for the food . our waiter was very fast and friendly . he was a very soft spoken gentlemen and it was difficult to understand him at times . he was fast to refill waters and diet cokes so i really ca n't complain . here is what we ordered : * thai spring rolls - these were excellent as was the dipping sauce which had a nice kick to it . i would order these again . * tom yum goong - this had a nice kick and a nice flavor . however , i would have liked more `` stuff '' in it . it came with some mushrooms and shrimp , but could have used a bit more . i would order this again but some of their other soups looked good as well . * steak & chicken with spicy thai lemon garlic sauce - this was ok . it was just some strips of cheap beef and chicken with some sauce . the chicken was good but the beef was just eh . i probably would n't order this again . * garlic and peppers - this was just ok too . my wife ordered it with tofu instead of chicken , but we got the chicken anyway . we did n't send it back because i do n't like doing that and maybe this was a `` sign '' to try the chicken because it is amazing . anyway , the dish had good flavor but it was eh . my wife would probably order this again , but i would n't . for the heath conscious , each of our entrees were not covered in tons of sauce so that 's a plus . however , the menu said they had brown rice , but we were told they did n't have any so that was a negative . i have n't had much thai food in my day , but i think this place is more chinese than thai . perhaps we just did n't order the right things ? judging by the reviews on here it looks like i should have done my homework before my visit to be sure i ordered properly . i would n't rush back here but i wo n't cross it off my list just yet because i do n't think i ordered what i should have . however , as far as thai food goes in my book , it is thai basil all the way .		3		0
argghhh . i love to hate this place . why ? for starters , they are open 24 hours . do you have any idea how dangerous that is ? it 's good for me they are n't right down the block . but when i finally do decide it 's time for a donut run at around , oh , 11pm , i make that drive of shame just to find out they do n't have any buttermilk or maple bars left , so i have to settle for whatever they have left . which i then promptly cram in my pouting face . -lrb- it 's not my favorite , but it 's still a donut , guys ! -rrb-		3		0
i have to admit , my first job was working at in-n-out burger . for that reason , i may be a bit biased towards their fair-priced , fresh food . to pay $ 12 for something at smashburger that would cost me about $ 7 at in-n-out , i 'm forced to take away 1 star . i do like this place , though . they have quality ingredients , great customer service , and overall good food . i 'm not a big burger person , so i order the smashchicken . i like all of the topping options they have , including : different buns , chipotle mayo , ranch , sauteed mushrooms , avocado , bacon etc. . that is something that separates them from my previous employer . the chicken is always cooked well , and might be a bit salty from time to time . a couple of times my bun was super greasy , too . i love their haystack fried onions and sweet potato fries . they come well seasoned , and go great with their chipotle mayo for dipping . i would also recommend their malts -- delicious ! i definitely like this place enough to give it 4 stars , but on my budget , i have to consider the value for what i 'm getting . yes , it is quality food , but i feel like compared to some other places , their prices may be a bit steep for what you get .		3		0
this is pretty much all you got here in az , i guess . and for that kinda big but still small fun , it does its job . i can honestly say that in the midst of the fun with the kids that i somewhat forgot i was in a small place in phoenix . it has a big amusement park feel because of the layout and of course the sounds of rides everywhere . the atmosphere actually hits the mark . adults can have fun here if they do n't take things too seriously or expect too much . this is n't cedar point . this is a big permanent carnival , minus the house-o-fun . and you 're not going to get high-end rides here . so as long as you go in knowing that this is going to be a `` eh , good enough '' type ordeal , you 'll be good . the big coaster is decent but over very quickly . two loops and a high speed makes it fun while it lasts though . again , if you 're trying to compare this to something like the millennium force ... or even the magnum , you 're going to hate it . cut the place some slack , its not able to be a big dog like that . once you 're done with that , its downhill in terms of thrills . they have the skydive ride that drops you straight down from a high height ... can make mom scream , i guess . the line moves quickly so its worth a go . everything else is low thrill , decent fun , and mostly for the younger kids . your go-karts are slower than they need to be , but i guess for the younger kids ' sake , that 's how they keep it . bumper cars are bumper cars . bumper boats is ordinary with a nice little island thingy to mess around with . karts and boats lines moved terribly slow . i did n't visit the arcade ... dunno how that happened . mini golf was pretty fun . well designed courses and decently upkept . very nice scenery . food was terrible . i mean it . oh man . had a gyro ... it had ranch and hot dog onions on it . not ok . fries were bad . churro was horrible . even the lemonade should 've been thrown in the garbage . and the wait was ridiculous . one lady waited at least 20 minutes for some burgers or something . my cuz mentioned the nacho chips were crap . an old lady started swearing loudly after she bit into her chili dog , then she body slammed a small child . kidding . but is it a good time ? yes . take your kids . they will have plenty to do . and go with a group of 8 riders or more ... you get a substantial discount ... unless that is only on certain weekends . ask the cops who stand outside to guide the lines -lrb- yes , its that crowded on saturdays -rrb- . speaking of staff - everyone actually had a decent attitude ... no smarmy kids who showed that they hate their job . we paid about $ 15 bucks for all day passes and a round of golf after we gathered up 8 riders . otherwise , its like $ 26 for that same package . check the website for accurate pricing . too expensive ? well i mean its either this that has a lil ' roller coaster , or crackerjacks , fiddlesticks , amazing jakes or ... thats about it . yeah you get a buffet at amazing jakes for less - so i guess thats the only competition . oh . . and i read about how the ` shady ' crowd seems to hang out here . i did n't see anything like that at all ... and this was a saturday . its just young people . the same ` kind ' that you see anywhere else . do n't let any of those types of comments put you off from going here . no one 's gon na shank you .		3		0
ok , i will try to be nice here . but i will warn you , the two worst things that can happen to a customer in a restaurant happened to our party . : -- lrb - sorry lolo 's but you fell a bit short . i was looking forward to the lolo 's chicken and waffles experience for quite some time now , and the ` rents invited the starving college student , me , to breakfast . the wait was a bit out of control , however i had an open mind , apparently this place is kind of a big deal and i should be patient . so i was . when we finally got a table , perfectly set aside from everyone else so it would be easy to wrangle the toddler that was with us , good job lolo 's on this one ! , we immediately ordered drinks , that all but two out of eight were wrong . no big deal though , it was fixed pretty fast , as there are a million employees there . i am pretty sure we never saw the same person more than once . one to take our drink order , a different to deliver our drinks , a different person to take our food order , you get the picture . anyway , we are having a great time socializing then the food starts to take a little bit of time , but they are busy so we do n't bitch about it . when the food finally came , that is when all hell essentially broke loose . the sever first dumped an entire cup of syrup down my dad back , on the chair and all over the floor . dad was not happy needless to say , but did n't freak out . the poor kid apologized but no other employee , i.e. manager , came by to help or apologize . then , right after the spillage , he handed me my food , which was totally wrong first of all , and there was a gigantic moth sitting a top my mac and cheese . that was par for the coarse folks . i mean look at the plate before leaving the kitchen people , hello ! i am sure i will go back at some point in my life . however , with all that happened , and the lack of anyone in the joint giving two sh *** s about our happiness , i wont be going out of my way .		3		0
5 plus stars for decor . . i am a sucker for that whole post modern retro vintage look ... love it . i love the john deer tractor in the dining room and the old wood everywhere , i love that it still looks like a store front and has a rich red paint on the inside . i love the cafeteria style serving with the old fashioned look to it . i even adore the old retro sodas in a tin . but i have to say 3 stars for food . the ribs did not have the flavor that i crave with ribs . i see and smell the smokiness , but there was almost too much sweetness with the overbearing sauce , it was nice but not delicious . the coleslaw tasted like they ran down to smart and final and bought the big bag of coleslaw mix and the jar of coleslaw dressing . . boring and bland . the mac and cheese however was super yummo . baked with a cheesy crunchy top that made it comfort food . i also really like the cornbread , not too sweet not too bland and honey butter very delish . we also had an interesting dessert sweet potato crunch that i am still pondering a mash of sweet potato with a creamy texture with a bit of nuts and brown sugar . ice cream cut the richness . i want to adore joes , i want to say it 's an all around winner . i want to sit in the restaurant and enjoy the decor , but maybe i 'll go for the cornbread . hey parents -- the kids menu is a rib sandwich ... which would n't have been a hit with my kiddo ...		3		0
this is purely idiotic coincidence that i am writing this review on 4/20 . although i like cheba hut , my experience at this one was less than stellar . i absolutely love the hemp cheese which i get in my griefo . took a little too long for my sandwich to be made despite that there was no one there . i finally came up to the counter when they called me and he basically just asked what vegetables i wanted ; no offering the `` special sauce '' like the other cheba hut does , and he did n't ask after that what else i wanted . because there was two other people with me i did n't pay attention too much to my sandwich until he handed it to me . a different person was making my sister 's sandwich and was asking her if she wanted things in her sandwich that the other guy did not ask me . long story short i ended up having to ask the new guy to add a bunch of things to my sandwich which brought the time to 15 minutes to make my sandwich . as much as i love hemp cheese , there is a point to where it can be overload . the guy did n't remember that i still have to be able to eat the sandwich and loaded it with a ridiculous amount of cheese that it was incredibly messy and irritating to eat . i think i will just stick to the mesa location from now on . on the bright side i tried the fruit crispies marshmallow treat , it was delish !		3		0
my first q ` doba experience also happened to take place in madison , wi where i would visit a good friend of mine while living in the chicago area . this was back around ' 99 - '00 or so , i believe , and i 'd never experienced a chipotle to compare it to . i really enjoyed it at the time , so much so that when i moved to michigan i would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one . i was pretty psyched when the one on rural opened up out here because chipotle never sits right in my stomach -lrb- not that it necessarily stops me ... but i always dread the impending doom that eating there brings -rrb- . unfortunately , this was n't exactly the q ` doba i remembered , and it 's just sorta average . i like the chicken , but the steak is blah . queso is ok , but i 've had much better . this is the one place where i actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa , and i like the hot as well . no salsa complaints here . i usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at chipotle , which consists of three tacos , a drink , and chips and salsa -lrb- queso at the q -rrb- .		3		0
i just walked in the door from bs west , and i thought i had reviewed it , but i had n't , so here it is . i love bs west . granted , it 's my second gay club experience -lrb- second to forbidden , which is kind of like a joke now -rrb- , but i have always have a great time . i 've only frequented on wed. , thurs. , and sat . , which are pretty popular nights , especially with the 2for1 drinks . like others have mentioned , the drinks are strong and the bartenders are really nice . i usually copy what my friends get to drink since i 'm not yet an avid alcoholic , so when i asked one of the bartenders upstairs what he recommended , he steered me in the right direction to tokyo teas which i absolutely adore . the dj on thurs. is typically this `` older '' gent who plays weird remixes , but tonight the dj was younger and pretty crackin ' . i honestly really just enjoy seeing people of all types , straight/bi/gay , black/white , `` insert more mj lyrics here '' , out having a good time . it gets hot as hell inside and a little crowded on the dance floor , but bsw rox my sox		4		1
i noticed andreoli 's , and actually went by it many times on my way to and from different businesses in the fry 's center . but for some reason , i had never gone inside . since i live nearby , i try to explore all the interesting eating places in immediate vicinity , and one day i decided i was hungry for an italian sub . since i was near andreoli 's i decided to give it a try -lrb- plus the vermont sandwich company was closed -rrb- . entering the deli , it was very nice inside - very comfortable looking and small , with a few tables . since i was looking for a sandwich to go , i looked at the menus on the reader board/white board and ordered . the sandwich came in a to-go box , with a side of salad . there was no one else in waiting , and it took several minutes for someone to notice me - but that was ok since i had a chance to go over the menu . the person that took my order was very informative and nice . when i received the sandwich , i was initially disappointed , since it seemed small for the price , and as always , i was hungry . but i was pleasantly surprised when i arrived home , and had a chance to taste it . it was very good - the bread was perfectly cooked , and the meat and cheese were very complimentary . i have gone back several times and tried different sandwiches and pastas , and everything i have had is delicious . so if i am really hungry , i will go to other places in the area . but if i am craving authentic italian food , and am out for a walk , i go to andreoli 's .		4		1
i 'm still not sure if it 's a 3 or a 4 . . so let me give you the experience . this place is very small - they have an outside patio that seats about 11 total . . and 5 more on couches with these almost hideous looking coffee-tables . we arrived on a friday -lrb- first friday , which we totally had n't planned that -rrb- and since we did n't know we 'd need -lrb- nor had we made -rrb- reservations , we were seated on a two-person red couch with the ugly coffee-table to eat from . we were both not big fans of this , but hey , at least we got seated with no reservations -lrb- there were a lot of ppl that came after us with no reservations and were turned away . . sucks -rrb- . ordered two beers - they came out quickly . ordered 2 entrees : the market special -lrb- which was veal -rrb- and the portuguese stew . i had the stew and he had the veal . his came out quite a bit before mine -lrb- did n't care for that -rrb- and then when i finally got mine , it was not at all what i expected . it was * spicy * as all hell -lrb- i must 've missed that on the menu -rrb- and had a lot of seafood and a big tilapia on top ... i guess i was expecting a soup . . that 's my bad for not knowing that stews and soups are different . he loved his dish -lrb- finished it before me -rrb- and i did not care for mine with all the spiciness -lrb- i had a runny nose the whole time from the spice -rrb- . . luckily the server lady asked how i was liking it and i told her the truth but told her i was really hungry so i was just going to eat it . she said sorry , left and came back and said the chef wanted to add extra sauce to tame down the spiciness . . she brought it back quickly and it was heaping with mixed in manchego cheese -lrb- though the tilapia i had n't finished yet was missing now -rrb- . . the flavor was fabulous . . but it left me wondering about my tilapia . maybe he switched the tilapia out for more mussels . . whatever , that 's fine . i was just glad that i could finally eat my meal . . though i ate it alone because , again , his meal had come first and was now gone -lrb- i told him not to wait because i knew a freshly hot veal chop would get cold in the patio where we were and would not be as enjoyable -rrb- . so . . alas . . conclusions : there were several minuses mixed in with some pluses . . i would n't say i 'd never go back , but it was a good experience and i 'd give it another try to see how it would go on another visit .		4		1
the clarendon has one of the best happy hour restaurants we 've eaten in . great fish tacos ! we spent our new years eve hosted by the clarendon . it was very inexpensive , at only 25 bucks . they hosted a gatsby theme and luckily , most everyone showed up dressed to the 9 's ! the party was held at their pool lounge area which had plenty of heat lamps and lots of room to move . or you could head up to their roof top patio which has amazing city views . there were heat lamps also . cash bar and a dj for the party . it was nice to be able to move about so freely without constantly bumping into other party goers . a couple of things to consider : the rooftop patio is floored with wooden planks with gaps in them . did n't bother me , but i noticed several women in their high heels get caught up several times in the gaps . the dj was ok i guess , but i did not care for his music . only towards midnight did people start dancing and he did n't interact with the crowd at all . all of a sudden , we just hear `` 10 , 9 , 8 , ... '' and that was it . lastly , the wine pours . very inconsistent . i believe a drink is 5oz , but the bartender only served us 3oz . later that night , i got a completely full glass . good for me ? but that 's nitpicking . fun night and lots of taxis lined up outside to take you home !		4		1
pour me a glass and bake me a pie , cuz i 'm gon na be here for a while . though humble and almost unnoticeable on the outside , parlour has a beautiful interior with great acoustics . lots of bustling ambient noise to make you feel like you 're part of a scene but spaced out enough that you do n't have to listen to your neighbor 's conversation . relaxed enough that you can stay a while as well . they 've done a terrific job with the design and decor , which contibutes to it 's `` chill '' factor . the food has always been excellent . even without cheese , these pizzas are stellar . anything with those roasted wild mushrooms piled on top is worth ordering . they once had a vegan appetizer special that was to die for and i 've been waiting for it 's reappearance . the wine and cocktails are very enjoyable - and i 'm not a cocktail person . these bartenders know what they 're doing . that last star did n't quite make the cut because of the spotty service . not terrible service , just somewhat inattentive and aloof , though i 'm starting to think that 's a trend in hip phoenix restaurants . overall , i love it here . for the price and the atmosphere , it 's a terrific place to spend a few hours chatting up a storm .		4		1
hmmm . was just reading the bad reviews but what can i say , i love this place ! i have been coming here for lunch since i moved to arizona from california 13 years ago and they still have my favorite salad , sandwiches and the glazed lemon cookie !!! arcadia farms has the best arnold palmer and i always order this when i am here . i like the ambiance , cute little place to have a nice lunch with your girlfriends and just sit down and enjoy the outdoor sitting -lrb- except for the occasional birds that come flying close by -rrb- ! but heck , the birds are part of what this place is all about , just make sure not to feed them anything please ! service is pretty good and the servers do pay attention to you , even when you 're sitting solo -lrb- my friend was late and so i was sitting by myself waiting -rrb- . there was the issue of breakfast and lunch but our server was very helpful and gracious about it . i think what i love about this place is that it reminds me of where women gather to meet their friends and just sit down and have a good chatty time ...		4		1
ok , ok , ok another strip mall restaurant in phoenix . i get it . we can be a fab place in a drab space . wow , how cool , i just came up with a new motto . but let me just say , pcg , as the regs call it , is a fab place . voted many times as a local hot spot or a great neighborhood spot , pcg actually shines on many levels . yes , the space itself is not inventive or trendy . but why do we go out to eat ? mostly for some killer ass food . well , you got it here sister . appetizer : bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cotija ... yowzaaa yowzaa potsie . yummy ! the tenderloin rivals ruth 's chris and any other high end steak place . the corn cakes are , well , let 's just say i 'd raffle off a limb for these babies . pot roast is right off my momma jo 's dining room table . the pork tenderloin entree makes miss piggy cry and me , well i 'm weeping already . juicy , firm white meat with amazing sides . services runs always a bplus to and aplus . waitstaff knows everyone and is literally family to the owners and management . i love it here . now , the space . yes , it 's a mini mall . but they 've made it iintimate and not sports bar like . the gang here has made a home run on every level . it 's like coming home everytime i eat here . eat at pcg people . it 'll give strip malls a new meaning !		4		1
this place belongs in europe . there is plenty of parking , you can grab samples of all their sauces , bruschetta , and specialty foods while you wait for your food . it is a relaxed environment where you order your food and they buzz you when it is ready . i always get their turkey sandwich that has apples in it . they have hot meals for dinner such as lemon chicken which is also a winning choice . there are plenty of side dishes to choose from . for dessert you have to try the cupcakes that are made with olive oil and their cannolis . you only live once , so go for the splurge . your waist size wo n't mind . if you possibly ca n't eat anymore , grab a box of the variety cupcakes for to go . the flavors are unique such as lemon , mexican lime , blood orange , etc. . you can take your food and eat it under the olive trees . at night there is live music and the setting is very cute . it is a family place and you can have your kids run around freely without annoying the other guests .		4		1
this past weekend i had my staycation in phoenix for a little downtime . saturday a few friends and i wanted to go somewhere delicious no one had been and one of them suggested portlands . i had only been there for drinks a couple times , and loved the bar area , so i figured it would be nice to come back and try some dinner . one thing that amazes me about this area is how there are always so many cars parked along the road , yet no one is ever in any of the establishments -lrb- aside from fair trade -rrb- . luckily there is the slightly hidden parking deck so we were able to find a spot there . we got there right on time for our reservation . it was very empty when we got there yet it took a good 15 minutes to be seated . i ca n't say the dining service here is very efficient . however , there are so many things on their menu i want to try that i can see myself coming back a few times . i started off sharing the scallop appetizer with the butternut squash with a friend and it was so good . the butternut squash was perfect and the scallops were mouth watering . my main dish was the pork with the bourbon apple glaze and the au gratin potatoes and vegetables -lrb- i feel horrible that i forget the name -rrb- . it was just the right amount of food and absolutely delicious . the au gratin potatoes were fabulous and the glaze on that pork was to die for . it had huge apple chunks with it too and omg ... so delicious . the vegetables were carrots and two spears of asparagus and i have to admit they were n't the best . i usually kill for asparagus and the carrots tasted better . the burgers on the back of the menu looked amazing as well as the phyllo chicken a friend had . the menu 's fantastic . you need to try it .		4		1
let me preface this review by saying i have only ever enjoyed casey moore 's as a bar and have never had the food , though i hear it is good . the bar is nice , right off of mill ave/university but a bit tucked away from the mill crowd . you will definitely get a unique people watching experience , as the crowd is diverse from college co-eds , to hipsters to punk ... you get my point . the alcohol selection is great , my fave being ace pear cider , they also have stella artois , which i have found to be quite difficult to find on tap in other locations . added bonus , men get to use the `` stone '' outside restroom , where you pee , well on a stone outside . kinda jealous considering there is always a wait for the 2 stall women 's bathroom . this place is always crowded , on this occasion i went on a wednesday night and it was packed . service is always good and friendly , though they could afford to hire more people as the wait for drinks when being served is usually long . it beats going up to the bar inside though , as that wait is usually just as long . the parking is a mess , as the lot is small and well , it 's always crowded . be wary of parking in nearby apartments , as your car will be towed .		4		1
the roosevelt is s-e-x-y , sexy . i can not believe it 's taken me this long to write a review of a spot i tend to frequent but after spending , geeez , i dunno , maybe 4 hours here on saturday night i was just smitten enough to sing full praises . historic home turned bar , the roosevelt is dark , romantic and the perfect place to spend hours drinking wine , -lrb- by the glass or bottle -rrb- or beer -lrb- from their fairly extensive beer menu -rrb- while getting to know that special someone ... or , stop in for a nightcap after dinner or a night out downtown . the roosevelt offers small plates that are all quite tasty , my favorite being the bacon wrapped dates . i love turning people on the wonderful world of dates , and bacon and cheese is the best way to do that . the setup , as mentioned in previous reviews , is awkward . but hey , this was a home that has been converted to a bar and you are sitting in one of the three bedrooms . i 'm not really sure how else it could be done without knocking out walls and ruining some of the sexiness ... do n't do that ... i 'm a smitten kitten roosevelt , dare i say , full of smit !		4		1
yayyy ! i recently returned to mbfge after a 1 + year hiatus . i was in dire need of some food in my belly . here is my review for the tempe location -lrb- not sure if there are others ... -rrb- ~ fud/drink ~ the greek food is exceptional considering its in a fast-to-plate setting . right off the bat , flavors mix well and do not taste amateurish . they have enough unique items on the menu to give the gyro-happy crowd something to cheer about , as well as the adventurous ones who wants to try the greek fries , etc. . the daily specials actually seem to be special , with lobster on the menu as well as other fish items , it just keeps the variety going . they have a lot of drink specials throughout the week , although i have n't taken advantage of them . i prefer to slip in for a quick pita then go off on my merry way . ~ atmosphere/service ~ good vibes come from this pita place . they get their orders out fast to you so you can enjoy , its no thrills or frills . the bathroom is dank and nasty , its pretty obvious they skimp on other things and focus directly in on the food . i want to make it clear that i do not stay , so its really not important that some things are skimped on , as long as the food is bomb ... which it is :-d if i were to stay , i would definitely do so in the bar , and i would suggest the same to you . more of an environment inside if you ask me . in all , its nothing like the usual my big fat greek restaurant . service is fast and friendly , they are courteous and mindful of your time . once again , no thrills , just good food and service . ~ extras/rating ~ the plates are huge here , you really do not need to push the extras with a lot of the plates ... you get a ton of food . they do have a lot of extras , though . do not consider this place a dive , it looks kinda dive-ish inside when you walk in , but just toss that misnomer aside . great place to grub out at with some friends . i give it a 4 out of 5 star rating for its low prices , quality of food to price -lrb- s -rrb- paid , specials/happy hour menu , and fast service by people with smiles on their faces .		4		1
came here pretty late - - like 30 minutes before they closed but the owner was nice and let us sit in . i ordered the cheese ravioli with alfredo sauce ... a little salty and there were only 7 pieces of med-sized ravioli ... which i thought was a little pricey -lrb- $ 13.95 -rrb- but it tasted pretty good . my boyfriend ordered their small margherita tomato and mozzarella pizza -lrb- $ 8.95 -rrb- ... very thin and crispy and pretty decent size for a small and a pretty good deal . the restaurant is relatively small ... has about 2 tables that fits about 5 people and 2-3 small tables for 2 people . most people i think usually order out at this place . it is supposedly located in a shady neighborhood -lrb- according to the owner -rrb- but we got out fine haha ... = x the restaurant itself is located in a small plaza at the very corner ... so it 's possible to miss it when driving at night but they do have a med-sized arrow sign that says pizza in neon florescence light as you enter the driveway . the owner was the only server ... he was very nice and talkative ... learned a little about arizona from him ... since he lived there for 6 years ... hehe i guess he was kinda bored too since there was no one else but us . overall i was pretty satisfied so i would come back to place when i 'm in arizona again hehe		4		1
armadillo grill has always been a great go-to for good bar food . besides general bar-fare , they offer some of the best weekly dish specials a bar can conjure up . they are not simply a otb or pool hall ... they are much much more . ~ fud/drink ~ as stated , they have superb dish choices each week . they do seafood/fish surprisingly well . the most memorable dish from here was actually a basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes . that , my friends , is not traditional bar-fare . the chef they have locked up -lrb- love that comment joe s. -rrb- does a stellar job . please do n't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up . but this is a multidimensional bar , which makes it so unique . they also have stellar drink specials throughout the week and into the weekend . the barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in ! they offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one . ~ atmosphere/service ~ once again , service is superb every time i go . i am by no means a regular , but they treat you like one . i feel at home here when i come in to have a bite or shoot some pool . there is no real dive atmosphere , its truly an interesting mix . the inside is by no means `` nice '' , its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room . along with the bar area with the regulars and the otb on the screens with rooting betters , it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one . you do not need to worry about loud noise though , the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise . i never have noticed much of a noise factor though , its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at . its impressive how you can go about it at the ` dillo . ~ extras/rating ~ call ahead for specials that day/week , the website they have does not get updated at all unfortunately . look online , there are numerous coupons available from different spots ... i use entertainment coupons here and they work like a charm ! they are n't the finest bar in town , that 's understood . but its drink specials , above-par food , central location and outstanding staff each earn a star , giving them 4 overall stars . much love for the ` dillo , ca n't wait to go back and check in !		4		1
its sat morning and the kick off for the breakfast club uye , i had picked wandering horse because i have wanted to try there breakfast buffet for months now . got there about 8:45 ish and saw many friendly yelper faces that made to the the breakfast club uye , made me smile , thank you everyone , it was a great dinning experience ! when i walked into the area of the food , let me tell you , its overwhelming , you may have had one idea of what you wanted to get , but then your eyes see so many other possibilities and that made your 1st choice seem lame . i had heard that the breakfast buffet has eggs benedict , but come to find out that 's only for the sunday brunch one , liltte sad about that , because i am a huge fan of hollandaise sauce , love that stuff !! i tried the omelets , hash browns , bacon , waffles & pancakes even the gelato and i have to say everything was just delicious , made me sad that i was full , because there was so much more i wanted to try : -rrb- service was good and for 9.99 plus tip , it 's a good bang for my buck ! i will be coming back for sure !		4		1
i 've visited twice recently and was pleased both times . to me , the atmosphere is more like a quaint , rustic french bistro with a modern flair than it is mexican , but pleasing , nonetheless . pay attention to their hours of operation . if i had , i would 've saved myself a trip on a sunday , when they 're closed . on one visit , there was only one customer in the restaurant , but that 's likely to change once the movie theater upstairs -lrb- currently closed for renovations -rrb- reopens . the staff was attentive and friendly . in fact , if you 're nice , the guy behind the bar may tell you a funny story about a trip he once made to a local movie theater ! my friend tells me the nachos -lrb- served warm -rrb- and salsa were very good and the taco salad was crisp and cool . i opted for the carne asada burrito which was very flavorful with its brown sugar and `` hot and sweet onion pepper relish '' . both entrees were large enough for leftovers to take home . if you decide to stop in , be sure to treat yourself to the empanadas -lrb- served in a pair . -rrb- my only gripe is that the menu states they are made of `` flaky puff pastry '' when mine seemed more like deep fried tacos . overall , i loved the dish . do n't be fooled by what looks like buffalo wing sauce topping . it 's actually a `` yucatan bbq sauce '' which makes this a terrific sweet and salty dish -lrb- a plus in my book -rrb- . if you 're looking for traditional mexican , you 'll probably be disappointed , but if you 're enthused by trying new and creative food , it 'll be right up your alley . prices are fair to moderate , but worth it , especially when you factor in happy hour discounts . they 're even better with groupon ! tip : parking is conveniently located steps away in the garage behind the facility . be sure to get `` validated '' before leaving the restaurant and your parking fee is waived !		4		1
i 'll admit a flaw when dining : that is , atmosphere goes a looong way with me . even if the menu is mundane , the wine is uncreative , or the waiters curt , you can still win me over with making me feel like a badass in your restaurant . after all , most of our palates are n't refined enough to decipher the differences between feral rabbit and wolverine paws . not that they serve either of the two here , but you get the point . radio milano , in fact , does not have a boring menu , average wine or rude waiters ... but there is nothing here to absolutely thrill you . what it is , is creative food that is presented magnificently , but lacks a certain flair . when i went -lrb- date night -rrb- , we had the roman artichoke with bread crumbs -lrb- great -rrb- , vegetable antipasti -lrb- good -rrb- , and the meatballs with some spaghetti -lrb- average -rrb- . their portions are pretty small , so luckily my gf is a light eater and is just as thrilled with atmosphere and booze as i am . for dessert , we had the olive oil cake , which was creative , but slightly above average in taste . what is awesome are the drinks . i had a ginger press -lrb- they use tito 's handmade vodka ! -rrb- and my gf had the sauvignon blanc . both delicious and unique to the valley . i wanted to have another , but we decided to head over to postino to continue on a little wine tour , however , their cocktail and wine list is impressive . all in all , i was mildly impressed with the food . they do a good job creatively , but they need to really improve on their specialties . their staff is very cool and i would certainly go back to visit the bar . also , i like that they are part of the lgo people , cos , face it , they 've increased the cache of central phoenix one million fold .		4		1
honestly it does not deserve 4 stars ... yet . i 've ridden this thing like 5 times total . and on each of the 5 rides i have seen the same asshole sitting in a seat . must be fucking nice to sit on said train all day for the last 5 days its been running . how about you get your seat hogging ass off the fucking train and let someone else sit down . still apparently on the honor system , i have yet to see one of these mystery security personnel checking for tickets or receipts . how long do you give before phoenix smartens the fuck up and puts up the chain link fences and guardrails so people must purchase a ticket before they can enter the platform area ? umm . . hello ?? semi smooth ride , much better then standing on a city bus . . where a bus driver can casually throw your standing ass all over the eisles while he guns the gas and then slams on the brakes . i did n't realize drifting a bus was possible . but i can swear to the fact it 's possible . i 'll keep giving this thing a chance . i 'm sure it 's nice when it 's not crowded .		4		1
one delirious food coma , a heavy dollop of cholesterol , two thick slices of saturated fat and a mild case of diabetic shock , to go please ! translation : let 's split the sweet tea , a pile of fried chicken , some waffles , the fried okra , cheesy eggs with onions , a bowl of mac n ' cheese and a slice of red velvet cake to go . brimstone was on the air , a haunting violin dirge could be heard wafting through my head , and a sinking feeling settled at the bottom of my gut . we just made a deal with the devil and we did n't even know it . that or i was just too hungry to function properly . but i do know that i would do terrible , devious things in the name of these chicken and waffles . pawnshops would know me by name and assume i had a hard drug problem , but my only addiction would be the sweet fried perfection of lolo 's chicken and waffles ! perfectly spiced , crisp but not overly battered , moist fried chicken that even colonel sanders would sell his soul for , provided he has n't already done so in his quest for chicken dominance . crunchy , buttery waffles with a hint of sweetness that are good on their own or smothered in warm maple syrup , that totally wipe the floor with those perpetratin ' waffle house hockey pucks . creamy , cheesy , smooth and decadent mac and cheese . a tribute to the best of granny 's kitchen and an affirmation that kraft should be drawn and quartered for their powdered cheese monstrosity . and sweet tea that quenches the thirst and makes your teeth hurt its so effing good ! or red kool-aid , lemonade , fountain drinks , or regular unsweetened tea for you nonbelievers out there . almost everything at lolo 's is done well , except for their red velvet cake . it 's dense and moist but the devil 's food taste -lrb- it 's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor -rrb- is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there was n't nearly enough to lubricate the bland , meaty red slice . it was a disappointment . but on the bright side , maybe this is confirmation that we did n't make a deal with the devil , cuz his cake was weak .		4		1
was craving thai food and while my options are now abundant i figured i would check out thai elephant . heck it 's not that far off the dash line and the dash circles around my ` hood now so why not . dinner for 2 reasonably priced and holy basil it was good . ok lame jokes aside . the food was very good . portions are enough to feed you twice and the flavors are off the charts . we split an order of pad z u , pad -lrb- something i forgot -rrb- the satay chicken skewers and the vegetable rolls . the tamarind dipping sauce for the satay ... excellent . the pad zu excellent . slightly sweet and decently spicy -lrb- i got medium -rrb- the dipping sauce for the vegetable rolls was a sweet peanut sauce . very tasty . the other pad dish was excellent as well . wish i could remember its name . pricing is affordable . considering the portions it 's perfect . the dining area is quaint and very comfortable . but if you have more then 5 people it might be hard to get seating if the place is busy . check it out , thumbs up .		4		1
narcisse is a funny place because it advertises that being narcissistic is a good thing . the decor has these decorative , novelty mirrors on the walls because narcissus , blah blah blah . thing is , i do n't think they 're being ironic or making any sort of comment on society being so shallow , i think it 's legitimately like a very `` greed is good '' kind of admission of character . it 's not satire . it 's scottsdale . the color scheme is purple . purple , purple everywhere . as such , i felt like i was in that one scene in batman -lrb- 1989 -rrb- where the joker poisons everyone and kim bassinger has to put on that red gas mask . i 've spent a lot of time describing what the place looks like , much more than i typically do , but i feel like it is an important part of the overall experience of coming here . look , for $ 10 , you get bottomless `` bubbles , '' which ... i thought was adorable that they kept saying `` bubbles ! '' but it turns out that at these kinds of places , everyone thinks they 're a champagne expert , which is kind of funny because it 's $ 10 , so if they do n't say bubbles or something adorable , people will get pissed . if you wanted to have classy sparkling wine , $ 10 would be the smartest use of money since steve jobs invested in pixar . there 's no need to complain unless you think that your snob muscle is getting flabby . everything else is reasonably priced , too . my breakfast burrito was pretty damn big and cost something like $ 9 . do n't get me wrong . it was bland . it certainly was n't bad , but it was like a rough approximation of a breakfast burrito and executed without all the love . i would n't recommend coming here unless your mission , really , is to have a group of people get kind of sauced in the morning and have some laughs , plug your gut with some food and probably pass out a couple hours later by a pool .		4		1
strong drinksss . i walked over here with some other folks from the restaurant leadership conference next door . tommy bahama was actually our second choice , we could n't get in at the first spot . we managed to snag seat in the upstairs bar area . service was fast and friendly throughout the meal . we shared an appetizer of big island goat cheese which was coated in macadamia nut pieces and served with strips of thin , crunchy flat bread . it was pretty good . i had a bowl of lobster bisque which was also very tasty . it could have used more lobster , but still , very good . i had one cocktail , the kumquat . i do n't recall what was in it other than a 5th of some sort of alcohol . what sold me on the drink was the house made sours . very good drink , good size and i would say two will knock you on your ass , one gets you half way there . at $ 13 it 's a pricey drink though . 3.75 stars , a strong showing for me , an anti-chain kind of guy .		4		1
okay , i 'm tired of looking at this on the front page . every time i see those delicious looking pancakes cluttering up my page , i want to slather them with butter as if i 'm rubbing lotion on a similarly brown beach babe . yes ! with my hands ! i seriously am infatuated with this place . i 've only been 3 or 4 times , but whenever we make plans to go , i get so excited . that being said let me get specific . the pancakes are good , the eggs -lrb- over-easy -rrb- are good , and the toast sopping up my running egg yokes are good . the breakfast potatoes are good , the fruit cup is good , and hell ... my coffee is even good . oh did i say good ? i meant great ! the service is top notch and they will make pretty much whatever you want -lrb- if they have the ingredients and know-how -rrb- . plus , where else can you go to eat breakfast with rooster statues staring at you ? located behind the home depot on country club/baseline , this is a hidden secret of the mesaonians ...		4		1
it 's hard to believe it 's been almost four years since i wrote my first review of switch . since then , i 've probably been to switch 25 + times , largely because i now live a few blocks away but also because it 's a consistently reliable place for a meal , drinks or both . some of my switch favorites : * the mozzarella and chop salads - unlike some other local restaurants that will go unnamed , switch 's salads are n't all overly sweet -lrb- i am so sick of strawberries and candied walnuts ! -rrb- . these two , in particular , are hearty but still have feel light and fresh . even the salad that does have the fresh fruit and candied nuts -lrb- the house -rrb- does a little differently , with fresh blackberries and raspberries and delicious fried onion straws . * the two seafood appetizers -lrb- lobster/crab puffs and the sesame shrimp -rrb- - the first is rich and really satisfying with a light drink and the shrimp are very fresh and flavorful with an asian kick . * the veggie burger - so delicious . we were surprised to find out the veggie burger was n't made in house because it certainly tastes like it is . it 's very filling and does n't fall apart like most , but still is n't overly formed or artificial . * amsterdam pasta - this is a little heavier than i normally order , but they do a great job making the sauce creamy without overwhelming . extra points for the truffle oil : -rrb- * cheap-ass brunch carafes - while the size of the carafes has reduced in the past few months , you still ca n't beat $ 3 bloody mary carafes -lrb- serve about 3 -rrb- and $ 6 mimosa carafes . how many lazy sunday afternoons have i spent downing 2 -lrb- or 3 -rrb- of these delicious concoctions . some of the improvable aspects of the experience : * the brunch service experience - while i understand it must be frustrating to serve super cheap carafes , they 're on the menu and people are there at your restaurant , instead of somewhere else in cenpho with almost-as-cheap drinks . so suck it up and do n't act like i 'm some cheapo or that i ca n't make a request simply because i 'm paying a small amount for booze . last time i went , i asked for a glass with a salted rim with my bloody mary carafe and was refused . another time , my friend asked for pineapple juice in the cape cod carafe and got a lot of attitude about `` changing something that 's already cheap . '' even if he were charged extra -lrb- which is fine -rrb- , the server could have just said that and made the whole thing a lot less awkward . * the overly-sweet specialty drinks - most of their daily drink specials are really sugary , with tons of grenadine and syrups . i would n't mind seeing just a good old vodka soda every now and then . * the martinis - i 've ordered a dirty martini a few times there and i never will again . must be the olive juice ? * the brunch food menu - it 's quite small and has few vegetarian options . could definitely be expanded . i definitely wo n't stop going to switch , especially since it 's so close , and i 've had so many great experiences there , but i 'd like to see them invest a little time in fixing some of the cons .		4		1
it took me way to long to get to daily dose , and it 's taken even longer to get to my review , but my one resolution this year is to get caught up ! stopped in for lunch with my husband since we were already parked nearby . while the restaurant is fairly small , we were there at an off hour so no wait at all ! we shared the cobb salad and the ancho chili reuben . they initially brought one salad and the sandwich was split for us . i foolishly assumed the salad was to be shared until a second one came out . are you kidding me ? how big are these salads ? pretty darn big , and pretty darn good . plenty of bacon and blue cheese , and no skimping on the avocado either . unfortunately , they do n't come in half sizes which is too bad if you 're not sharing because i ca n't imagine being able to finish one -lrb- and i can eat -rrb- and leftover salad just does n't work . not to mention it 's not easy for me to order a salad to begin with . i have good intentions , but as i open my mouth to speak , something like `` chimichanga '' comes out instead . the reuben was good , but a little dry . next time i 'll ask for extra dressing on the side . i 'm looking forward to going back and trying that french toast julia t raves about !		4		1
the food is fantastic , but the portions are disappointing . you 're paying for the quality of the ingredients at america 's taco shop . the food is not that expensive , but you 're going to need to order more than you think you need to if you want leave feeling full . just be ready to spend a lot more than you thought you would at this dive . i had the carne asada burrito and pastor taco . i love that there 's guacamole in the burrito , and the caramelized onions are great . the burrito is fantastic , but a little smaller than i 'd like for $ 6 . there is an xl option for $ 1 more . maybe i should try that next time . the taco was also really good , but also small for $ 3 . all sides , including chips and salsa , are going to cost you extra . my taste buds were certainly satisfied . the food 's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains -lrb- it may even be better than many full service restaurants -rrb- , but you 'll get a lot more for your money at those other places . your options for everything is steak , pork , or veggie . i probably should have asked this while i was there ; but what does america 's taco shop have against chicken ? the restaurant is small . it does feel a lot like a little cantina somewhere in mexico . there 's very little room inside . the patio seems like an okay spot , but i would n't want to be inside or out on a hot summer day . the parking situation is really bad . the lot is tiny . your best bet is to skip the lot and just find room on the neighborhood streets .		4		1
when i first stumbled upon this bakery it was during my lunch hour and i was getting bored with my usual selections at sack 's next door , so , i decided to give it a try after reading a review of essence on the chowbella blog . anywho , i was saddened that they no longer had any croissants and only a few macarons left , so , i ordered a quiche lorraine along with a side order of the spanakopita . i guess i was in true hunger mode , and the smells wafting through the air of the baked goodies along with the lingering scent of the already gone croissants were making my tummy rumble far more than usual . so , maybe i had an expectation that the price i paid for a quiche lorraine at $ 7.95 would be satisfying to match my hungriness . sadly this was not the case instead the quiche turned out quite petit and somehow the portions were really meant for a light lunch . my first visit was marred by my expectations of the food and although quite good in itself with taste and quality ingredients it took awhile for me to come in for another visit until this morning . when phoenix new times , yelpers , and other food enthusiasts have simply raved about the croissants -lrb- both plain and chocolate -rrb- , you know ... you just have to try it at least once . and i will tell you ... yes ... these croissants are close to perfect . so light , flaky , buttered goodness ! i am not a croissant connosieur at all not even close simply due to the fact that i am more of a pastry fan and would rather have cake , or some stuffed cheese pastry moreso than a croissant but sometimes the hankering gets me that i need a cafe au lait with a croissant . any maybe i have a bias with my other croissant love at p. croissant in south tempe but believe you me ... these croissants are heavenly . they are so scrumptious and buttery , that every bite seems to have a layer of lightly buttered deliciousness , and it messes with your senses of how good this is . so , if you have time before work , stop by for a croissant and a cafe au lait , or enjoy saturday brunch at this wholesome bakery . it 's worth it , and essence , thank you for your perfect croissants . i 'm in love .		4		1
say what you will about arizona restaurant week -- the crowds , the not regular diners dining out , etc. , but it got us to try crudo , and wow , will we be going back . first , some location observations -- hard to find since there is not good signage on indian school . second , lovely upon walking into restaurant but what is the very strong smell of wood smoke ? it dissipated as we went into restaurant , but still odd . my date and i were not seated at an empty booth for two , but by a table of 10 , and a table of 6 , where a young couple with their baby came in shortly after we started eating . really folks ? i get that you want to have a life once you have children , but do n't bring your fussy , crying one year old out to a finer establishment at 7 pm . on a saturday night . i work too hard to earn my dining dollars . get a sitter or stay home . -lrb- okay , enough soapbox -rrb- . waiter was friendly , was great about explaining the wine and the dishes . here 's what we had : * albacore crudo with apples , truffle , black garlic -- one of the most amazing dishes i 've ever had . * butterfish crudo with tomatoes , arugula - also outstanding * mushroom-mozzarella , truffle , egg -- a great melange of various mushrooms , melted mozz , truffle oil and a fried egg . heavenly . short rib-grilled root veg , mashed potatoes and horseradish -- comfort food elevated to a new level . dessert -- tracy dempsey 's flourless chocolate cake with hazelnuts -- creamy , decadent . in fact , i 'm going to go finish my leftovers of it now and dream of next time i can get back to crudo .		4		1
finally made it to tryst , i have been meaning to try this place for at least 8-10 months . we came here for a late breakfast before a doctor 's appointment . hubby had diet coke and i had decaf coffee . hubby ordered the breakfast burrito and i ended up going for our server 's recommendation -lrb- raechel -rrb- for eggs benedict , mostly because she mentioned the sauce had green hatch chile -lrb- i think she said hatch , but it is the green new mexico chile -rrb- . hubby liked his burrito very much , i tough the eggs benedict were ok , but i do n't think i would have them again . . i could see the green chile in the creamy sauce , but i could not taste it : -lrb- sweet potato tots were super sweet -lrb- duh ! hehe -rrb- and seemed a little too greasy ... but were still good . i was pleased with the glass cup for the coffee , it looked very fancy and nice . service was nice and friendly , and some other girl offered to refill our drinks even after we paid -lrb- that is a huge plus in my book -rrb- and she even got us a to go cup for the coke . i would like to come back but probably not very soon . receipt is a coupon for a discount on your next visit on sunday 4 pm to 8pm i think ... a free kid 's meal or a percentage off your check .		4		1
we decided to have this for dinner on a whim last night - and called to place a to-go order about 30 minutes before they were closing . we felt a little bad , but hey we were hungry and we did n't want fast food . there were 3 of us , so we all ordered the same thing - pollo fundido . it came with a side of beans and rice and some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes . we also got a bag of tortilla chips and salsa -lrb- spicy and mild -rrb- . the guy who answered the phone did n't seem too thrilled to be taking an order before closing . but when we went there to pick up the food they were actually friendly and gave us extra salsa for our chips without even asking . that was cool . we were able to place our order and pick up our food even before the restaurant closed . the pollo fundido 's were absolutely delicious and hit the spot !! we were mmm ` ing and awwww ` ing almost every bite . i would definitely order this dish again and again . they served a lot of mexican rice , which i was n't too excited about , but i 'm not a big fan of mexican rice anyway ... but the refried beans were great . i 'm officially a fan of this place !		4		1
i had the pleasure of eating here a few saturdays ago on a blind date : -rrb- i was craving some pho and my date was like sure , i have never had it before so lets go . we ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls which by the way were filled with tons of shrimp . i knew that had to have been a mistake because i swear i had a bite of shrimp each time . not that i am complaining one bit ! i ordered the chicken and shrimp soup -lrb- do you see a theme ? lol -rrb- and my friend kept it safe and just ordered the fried rice , which he says was some of the best he has ever had . my soup came out piping hot with tons of chicken and shrimp and herbs . i was one happy campy . so why the four stars if everything was good . the bathroom had a weird smell to it . i know , i know what does that have to do with the rest of the place . well if you got to go potty and the bathroom stinks , it kinds of throws you off you know . i will go back as the food was really good , i will just remember to avoid the bathroom next time : -rrb-		4		1
my husband and i went to blue martini with a few other couples for reverse happy hour on a wednesday night . we had an interesting time . the drink and food specials were awesome . half priced martinis come out to be about 7 bucks but it comes in a huge shaker equivalent to about 2 1/2 martinis . i ordered the mojito martini first , which i was n't crazy about . and that one did n't come in a shaker for some reason . hmmmm . but then i ordered the dirty martini . oh my god . it was probably the most delicious dirty martini i had in a long time . it was topped off with 3 succulent blue cheese stuffed olives . i wanted to lick the glass when i was done . we ordered some half priced appetizers too which were pretty good . light and tasty , and went really well with our drinks . service was efficient but cold . our server did n't seem thrilled to be there but she was attentive until towards the end when we lost her for a good 15 minutes when we wanted our tab . as far as atmosphere ... pretty entertaining . watching drunk middle aged singles interact is always fun . i would not like this place if i were single . not a really good singles scene for the under 30 crowd .		4		1
another day and another bakery ; a second stop on my tour of the valley of the sun would take me to scratch pastries & bistro , a relative newcomer -lrb- 2008 -rrb- to the scene featuring both baked goods and a bistro menu focusing not only on french inspired creations but also frequently utilizing french imported items in their creation . the brainchild of duc liao and his wife noelle based on their time in paris as a photographer and model , respectively , the space had originally appeared on my radar based on the recommendation of a friend and had only increased its status in my mind by advertising one of my favorite desserts - the paris brest - on their website . located in a rather unattractive strip-mall beside a subway my arrival to scratch would be just past noon and with the thermostat topping the century mark i made my way quickly from the car to the cute french-chic interior and greeted by two young ladies behind the counter i was asked if i planned to dine in or take some items to go , a decision i debated for a few seconds before i was handed a menu and left to decide . already with lunch plans i knew the bistro menu was not the choice -lrb- though admittedly the duck and foie gras had my attention -rrb- and as such i turned my attention to the pastry case only to be told that no paris brest was available - a disappointment to be sure , but at the same time given the variety of options -lrb- including a number of my other favorites -rrb- not totally disheartening and after a few moments of indecision i opted for three selections , paid the modest tab , and made my way outside to enjoy . beginning first with the only warm item of the group , an almond croissant fresh from the oven , my first bite from scratch would show that the liao 's time in paris had been well spent as the golden shell shattered on my bite giving way to an airy layered interior with a smear of sweet frangipane that not only added flavor and nuance to the already sweet pastry but also did not weigh down the wispy pastry inside ; a fine balance not often seen in american almond croissants . moving next to another french specialty , a small salted caramel macaron stored refrigerated in a plastic sheath , this two bite $ 3 cookie would prove rather average largely due to the temperature and a degree of dampness marring its characteristic crackling shell . with the filling ample in flavor i do wonder if perhaps the dry arizona air has something to do with the decision to store these cookies chilled , but overall it is not a decision i fancied when it came down to texture . for my final taste of scratch i opted for an american classic , my typical red velvet cupcake , and where the macaron disappointed the cupcake achieved at the highest level ; a textural masterpiece ranking in my top 3 red velvet cupcakes of all time . beginning first with the frosting , seemingly a small puff of sour cream cheese actually tunneling down into the body of the cake , it was quite good but where this cake truly stood out was its density - the sort of moist sponginess that made the cake seem almost undercooked as a bit of red dripped onto my hand , but in reality a veritable cloud of loaded with chocolate and vanilla tones that permeated the palate in perfect balance with the frosting . overall scratch was a good visit and i feel like i -lrb- pun intended -rrb- merely scratched the surface of what they have to offer - if and when i return i 'm calling ahead to make sure they have the brest and while i 'm there i 'll check out that bistro menu because , really , where else can you get duck and foie gras for lunch in town and chase it with a top notch french pastry or cupcake ?		4		1
recently met up with friends on a saturday afternoon for mimosas and $ 5 wines . i had not been to this location ! postino arcadia is my hang out . got ta say . . i like this one as much ! well , minus the valet dealio . but really there is not much space to do much with . i am such a fan of postino bruschettas . . i raved about them to my boyfriend for months before i got him in here on this particular saturday . so , instead of him letting me shine my bruschetta knowledge on him . . somehow he tells the waiter he wants a mix up and before i could intervene . . the waiter is off and brings us a variety of bruschetta he chose . not what i would have chose . but okay . sometimes i like to be controlling . i am working on that ; -- rrb - we gobbled that one board down . . and we order another . . always my favs , of course , -lrb- there 's that postino bruschetta knowledge and control thing again ! -rrb- , salami pesto ; tomato jam/sheeps milk cheese ; roasted peppers/goat cheese ; proscuitto/fig/mascarpone cheese . . yum . i wish that postino would let the customers fill out a card though on ` ideas ' for bruschettas . i 'd love to see a hot jam with a goat cheese . or a pancetta and sharper cheese like a french salut or even a sheep 's milk cheese . i am never , ever disappointed with postino . not.ever . great salads . paninis . adore the cheese board . love the $ 5 wine hours on the daily and the mimosas too . now i have my boyfriend loving it and thankfully , there are enough brews on tap that he likes should it not be a wine day for him .		4		1
these pasties are huge . i mean they 're bigger than janet jackson 's breasts , and they are a steal at $ 7 or so . so for value , quality and portions this is probably among your best bets in tempe . punk rock and british pub grub are predictable and go together like pb & j , but cornish pasty is probably one of the more distinctive restaurants in the valley for its niche of pasties in a quick service restaurant/diner setting . my buddy was in town visiting and staying in tempe wanted something unique for the area . given that he 's used to mexican , i opted for cornish pasty since it was nearby . my friend could n't finish his oggie , with steak , potato , onion & rutabaga , but i could n't resist polishing off the cajun , blackened chicken breast , bacon , ham and swiss , served with an addictive side of chipotle sauce . spicy , but not overwhelming , but a bit on the greasy side as a warning . the beer selection here is admirable , and had we not had to go back to work for the man that day , we would have certainly indulged . kronenbourg , boddington 's and strongbow on tap , plus your expected hipster brews available by the bottle : chimay and rogue among them . the setting looks diner-ish with its long narrow strip mall set-up and open kitchen . the atmosphere here is dark and weathered , but not dumpy . the difficulty here is deciding on a pasty . i could have easily gone for a meat and cheese , a mexican pasty , or chicken tikka masala . luckily , our server was very knowledgeable about the different pasties as we could n't make up our mind , so his recommendations were well taken .		4		1
i have to agree with most of the other reviews for ` the orange table ' in that the food is great , the atmosphere is awesome , and the service is a bit slow ... slow service is the only reason for minus one star ... other than that , what a cute little hidden gem ! when my friend marci h suggested we meet for lunch at the orange table last week , i was psyched to try it ! if it were n't for my friend , i 'm not sure i would 've ever found this spot ... but i 'm so glad i did ! it has a lot of character with the orange tables , local artwork , colorful atmosphere , indoor and outdoor seating , etc. . . another place where i can feel comfortable going solo and it 's dog friendly too ! i was feeling like something light and i went with the green salad with a scoop of their artisan tuna salad on top - it was served with the balsamic dressing on the side along with delicious hearty multi-grain wheat bread and a mini hershey 's chocolate . how cute is that ? marci went with the fresh mozzarella salad . that looked tasty as well . she ordered a side of their olive bread . i looked around at other diners and everything i saw looked fresh , colorful , and appealing . the menu is huge so there is something for everyone ! i will be back soon for sure to try the orange table 's breakfast and some of their other lunch options as well ... i 'll just make sure i 'm not in a rush when i go back . i recommend you do the same - go check it out when you 're not in a hurry and you can sit down and enjoy the charming ambiance and the fresh , colorful , delicious food !		4		1
pizza people pub is pretty awesome and has a great location in downtown phoenix . at tour de coops , i had seen their food truck , and my co worker ordered a pizza . it looked really good that i knew i had to make a trip to the pub ! the day before thanksgiving , me and judy f. had a thanksgiving eve dinner at the pub . very inviting atmosphere with unique informal seating areas as well as outside seating is available . a little cold outside right now , but ca n't wait when it 's a bit warmer in the evening to sit outside . i ordered the az jackass , similar to a moscow mule . pretty tasty and it was a dollar off for happy hour !! i could not resist ordering a mini mac ! it was so tasty with a crispy top and warm creamy middle . my pizza had pepperoni and mushrooms and was a 10 '' pizza which i devoured all of it ! the crust was really really good . however , they make it , it 's probably the best that i 've had in awhile , seriously !		4		1
i 've been going to us egg for about five years , and over that time the food has remained consistently great . their menu is large and is a good mix of the healthy and the , well , less healthy . the protein pancakes are their signature dish , and although i 'm not sure i believe the low `` net carbs '' they describe on the menu , they are still really tasty and very unique . i 've had a variety of omelettes and scrambles here and i really like them all . but most of the time i order the half-and-half which is a plate of a smaller portion of protein pancakes and a dish of their homefries mixed with veggies meats or cheese -lrb- there are a couple of options -rrb- with an egg on top . i always have them add a second egg to get the egg-meat-cheese-potato balance just right . it can be crowded on the weekend , especially during spring training and typical busy tourist times . the prices are very reasonable and the portions are big .		4		1
let 's say you need a clandestine meeting place . this is it . it 's a fairly decent sized saloon tucked away in the corner of a small retail plaza . in short , it 's off the beaten path and not easy to find unless you know it 's there . why is this important ? because when it 's time to break anything ; from your wedding vows , to fourteen violations of the rico act , -lrb- save for counterfeiting -rrb- here 's where you want to do it . the place is busy , full of locals , noisy in some areas , quiet in the back room , and , here 's the best part ; fbi wire taps are virtually impossible here due to the noise . or , let 's say you 're here on the off-chance to humiliate your concubine with 8 x 11 images of her doing it with her neighbor kid , again , this is the place . if you go , try the sirloin steak cobb salad for around twelve bucks . the ipa selection is lame so do n't expect a decent beer buzz . in the absence of a nice braciole and a good chianti -lrb- and fed 's listening devices -rrb- tavern grille is the next best thing to mama 's table . and when you 're done here , if it 's not too late you can walk next door to andreoli 's italian grocery for a nice cannoli and a yoo-hoo . i ca n't guarantee there are no bugs in adreoli 's . and no large crowd of people with which to display pictures of your mistress b ` jing little what 's - his-nuts next door .		4		1
i would rate the ambiance 5 stars , i love the decor ! the `` big ass fan '' -lrb- yes , that is what it 's called -rrb- on the patio , the chain links separating the dining room from the entryway , and the tree/candle back lit bar are great touches . i would like to give a pat on the back to whoever their interior designer was . now for the food and the only part i really care about . it was actually pretty good . it 's definitely not typical arizona-style mexican , so do n't expect that . i had the chicken burrito maria and my dining partner had some sort of crab and shrimp enchilada plate . i really liked my burrito , the black beans were a healthier alternative to refried , which i liked . i knew that the plates did n't come with beans and rice , but that did n't bother me - the burrito was enough to fill me up and it came with some kind of coleslaw . now the crab/shrimp enchiladas looked so good that i had to try a bite . the sauce is unique and unlike your typical enchilada sauce - it was cinnamony and creamy ! i will definitely get that next time . i also thought the chips and salsa were good , minus one major problem ... too much salt . i had to dust each one off before i ate it . i finally had to ask the waitress if there was anyway to get less salt on the chips , she was nice about it and completely understanding . i guess it was just a mixing problem . oh , and having 3 salsas to choose from is always a plus in my book . overall , it was service with a smile . i would go back and enjoy maria maria 's patio anytime .		4		1
i have heard so much of this little cookie shop that i had to make the trek from north scottsdale to see what the fuss is about . i do n't like cupcakes but got the orange blossom just to try and i still could n't get into it so i wont hold that against them . what i went for was the oatmeal raisin cookies . these cookies were pretty good but not nearly as soft or as chewy as i would of liked . i think they might of been even a little bit old ? i dunno , the flavors are all there though so i would like to go back and try again some time . i saved a few cookies for the next day and they were hard as a rock so i think i got the tail end of a batch or something . the berry muffin was fantastic . great balance of tartness and sweet , tons of berries , soft , fluffy , really good . the thing that really stood out for me was the morning buns . these are a buttery croissant with orange zest , cinnamon , and sugar and completely changed my view of cinnamon roles . these were light and fluffy and had a nice crust formed by the sugar so a flaky crunch when you bit into it and then it was gloriously buttery and soft in the middle and when you take a bit you taste the cinnamon and sugar but then come the orange zest and buttery flavor and man ... it was good . i could eat these every day all day . so in short , i came for the oatmeal cookies which left me a little ` meh ' but will come back for the morning buns which are now one of my favorite pastries .		4		1
i remember my first visit to a total wine like it was yesterday . i walked in and thought , `` hey now . where have you been my entire life ? '' and then i stood there blocking the front entrance . struck dumb by the vast number of aisles of goodness . i may have heard a harp or two . see , in new york we have to scurry up and down the liquor store aisle , sucking in our beer guts . it 's heresy to have a shopping cart as you shop in a store . so to have the option to effective drive a car down aisles of wine , well , i almost died . so when i heard the harp , i thought i was in heaven . with sliding glass doors . i meandered around the aisles and was so confused . nice people kept offering to help me . all the time . -lrb- where did they come from ? -rrb- fast forward to a year of phoenix life and i was a bit jaded . `` meh . we have booze everywhere ! you can buy it in chain stores ! what do i need a speciality wine store for ? '' i 'll tell you what i adore it for ! delivery ! i placed an online order and it was here within two days . yep . high five total wine ! you will forever be in my heart !		4		1
set in a very unassuming building is this treasure of a restaurant . the first time i visited about 8 months ago i got a bit tipsy on the sangria , so go easy with that stuff . the problem was that it made me forget what i had eaten . this time i was much better about the sangria consumption , just one glass . we did three dishes between the two of us , the tortilla , the spinach with garbonzo beans , and the special that night of eggplant layers . the tortilla is like a quiche of egg with potato and is okay . the eggplant was very good , but the winner of all was the spinach and garbonzo beans . i have just recently in the last 4 months gone vegetarian/vegan and am saddened at times by the removal of pork from my diet . when i started in on this dish i was concerned that i was violating my culinary discipline because the taste of pork fat was very prevalent . upon talking with one of the wait staff i learned that the magic ingredient was smoked paprika . absolutely delicious ! there were some people complaining about the noise which is hilarious to me . guess what its a tapas bar , its supposed to be noisy and boisterous . go to lola 's if you are ready for some conversation and good food !		4		1
thai elephant has made its way onto my `` special friday lunch '' rotation -- an honored list of my favorite places for takeout and get me out of the office lunch spots -- and i could n't be happier . a coworker told me about the place , and after trying trying their yellow curry , i was hooked . now , i 'm no connoisseur of curry , but i know what i like and i know what my taste buds like , and this curry was faaan-tastic . i ordered it mild because my taste buds are a tad sensitive , but that did n't take away from the robust flavors . the simple ingredients of the dish melded together beautifully to create a spectacularly savory meal . and , it was quite the portion for a lunch item . i had to save half of it , which i was hoping to have for dinner , but accidentally left in the work fridge . i 'm already thinking about when i 'll order from thai elephant again , and maybe the next time i 'll venture outside my curry comfort zone to try some other menu items . but , then again , why deny myself the joy of their curry !		4		1
i thoroughly enjoyed this place ! we went here on a whim because zipps was packed for monday night football . i am really glad we came here ! it is a quiet , clean , friendly place . we had the oktoberfest and sunup ambers and both were really good beers . they have a lot of beer incorporated into their food as well which i liked . we ended up getting the beer brat , a sunup salad and the steak wrap . the brat came with saukraut , beer mustard and steak style sweet potato fries . the fries were incredible ! best sweet potato fries in town ! the brat was delicious as well . the salad was served with bleu cheese crumbles and candied pecans that were very tasty ... the portion sizes were great , too . the steak wrap was pretty much a philly cheese steak in a tortilla which was fine because they did an awesome job with it . they do have tvs for sports as well so we were able to watch the game without a long wait and no crazy fans ! i am looking forward to going back here and trying the root beer they have in the cask . i also am excited to sample more of their beers ! but , because i didnt give it 5 stars here would be my points to improve upon : 1 -rrb- the waitress had at least 6 changes to the beer menu so we ended up getting lost in what was available and what had changed ... eventually we just went with the beers that were the beers of the month and were written on the wall . 2 -rrb- the bartender obviously knew some of the regulars sitting at the bar and didnt stop the inebriated chap from throwing his phone 16 times to prove that his case protects it from being broken . he 'd had 1 too many and he wasnt really being reigned in to much . not that this is an easy job -lrb- especially when it a regular who probably tips well -rrb- but it is still necessary . all in all , it was a great first experience !		4		1
i have been wanting to try this place out for some time . i had some vendors who came into town , and this is where we ended up for dinner . it really wasnt what i expected . it kind of through me for a loop . i mean , its in a very run down neighborhood -lrb- signs say park at your own risk -rrb- with bars over windows and doors . you get in , and it looks kind of average , nothing to hint that there are some food gods working behind the wall . they pretty much do tequilla only here . they have a tequilla list with over 100 tequillas on it . i opted for a simple margaritta with some tequilla i have never heard of and some fresh agave nectar . wow it was good ! we got the guacamole appetizer , and it was fantasic . all fresh made right at the table . next we moved onto the shrimp quesedillas . this was kind of an insight as to how complex these meals were going to be . the shrimp quesadillas were very good , so much so i didnt even realize i accidently ate the shrimp tail ! looking at the menu for dinner , its definatley not your everyday mexican food your going to see here . this is kicked up a notch . i would probably call this gourmet mexican food . never have i seen such menu items , where everything sounds so fantastic . it was like i was in mexican food heaven ! i had the special of the night which was a basted lobster tail in tequilla grilled over an open wood flame , 6oz filet mignon with a langustine/chorizo goat chease mixture on top , and grilled vegetables . i think it was their way of doing the filet ` oscar style ' . it was extremely good . everything turned out fantastic . my only complaint was parking . it was pretty tight to begin with . our server was strictly to the point , no lolly gagging around which actually turned out to be good in this instance for us since this was a business dinner . would definatley visit again !		4		1
i ate here once when it was lisa g 's and was n't too impressed . yes , i have to admit that i laughed heartily at the `` bowl of balls '' they had on their menu , but that was n't enough for me to go back . now that it 's the main ingredient , i went with low expectations . i had the winner salad - with turkey and salami and was impressed . the service was a little slow , but i liked what they did with the inside . it 's another refurbished house and filled with quaint tables inside . it 's got a killer patio , although i 'm sure for only a few more weeks before it 's intolerable to sit outside . i went a few days ago and had the strawberry goat cheese salad . we originally chose to sat inside , but there was blaring hip-hop music . i loved it , but the two people i went with for work did n't enjoy it as much . i thought hip-hop at noon was charming , but we ended up sitting outside . the service was n't stellar , but they seemed a bit overwhelmed that day . however , it 's a great place to lunch if you 've got a little bit extra time . you can also easily pick up from here for to-go goodness . i 've heard the sandwiches are good for gluten-lovers . i just love finding another place not too far from downtown that has awesome salads -lrb- because i get sick of going to cibo every day -rrb- . check them out , and go a little early for the best service . and hey , if you like hip-hop - maybe you 'll get lucky and sit inside on a day similar to the experience i just had . ps it also looks like it has a full bar - score ! i 've seen them fit larger -lrb- 10 ? -rrb- parties outside or inside if you just let them know ahead of time .		4		1
we decided to try smashburger because we had heard it was the best non-sit down burger place . i had the classic smashchicken sandwich with a side of onion haystacks . the sandwich was really good and i especially liked the sauce that came on the side . it was like a zesty cross between thousand island and ketchup . i liked that the chicken was grilled and not breaded . my fiance had the arizona burger with a side of french fries . he said it was really tasty . it came with guac , chipolte mayo , pepper jack cheese and jalapenos . we got our food to go so we could head home to watch the suns game . we did n't have to wait very long at all and the employees were very friendly . the patio is a bummer view of the best buy / fryes parking lot . but the inside is exceptionally clean and the service is fast . there are so many restaurants in this area but i like this place because you get a decent burger at a good price minus the drama . you do n't have to valet park or watch people trying to look cool while eating a burger . we will be back !		4		1
tonight was grand opening night . we were lucky enough to get an invite . this place rocks . the footprint of the place is relatively small , but there are large booths -lrb- 6-10 pp -rrb- , plenty of space around the bar and patio . the decor is super cool with one wall full of old-school retro speakers . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hi-fi-kitchen-and-cocktails-scottsdale?select=jt82qozdkg3bdzkid-zynq#jt82qozdkg3bdzkid-zynq another wall is where the dj booth is located and a projector showing graphics against the wall . the sound system is pretty good and there are 29 tv 's spread around the place . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hi-fi-kitchen-and-cocktails-scottsdale?select=cwp2gvxylem_8bcofcmphq#cwp2gvxylem_8bcofcmphq http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hi-fi-kitchen-and-cocktails-scottsdale?select=ezwdjh5-lro2j1sbgtjxpq#ezwdjh5-lro2j1sbgtjxpq the ceiling above the bar has a cool mural that has glow in the dark features with a black light that shows off those attributes . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hi-fi-kitchen-and-cocktails-scottsdale?select=a7k1sh4dgk5unxnulae2jg#a7k1sh4dgk5unxnulae2jg the spot is across the street from el hefe and majerle 's . the amount of foot traffic they will get on the weekends will be tremendous . this should be a winner . we had a few comp drinks and left after a little while ... it got crowded and we ran out of room to hang out . i could n't judge the service because we did n't stick around long enough and everyone is new . the bartenders at the bar were fast in filing everyone 's order and keeping up with the rush . we will definitely come back to check it out on a weekend night . return factor - 90 %		4		1
being that this place is in the same shopping center as my usual coffee shop , i drive by it constantly . i kept telling myself that i needed to come here , but it always slipped my mind . i finally staggered in here on saturday and am glad that i did . the place is simply decorated . nothing fancy or exciting , just a standard pizza joint kinda look . i sat down and took a look at the menu and was happy to see the variety of not only pizzas , but sandwiches and pasta as well . i was personally looking for pizza myself . the thing that i liked about their menu is the variety of pizzas that they have ... not a `` typical '' or `` traditional '' menu in my eyes . its not so far off the map that its its impossible to find something that you like , but they have options like `` sauce optional '' and veggie type pizzas which i think are cool . i went with a small invidiual 7 inch pizza with pepperoni . its chicago deep dish pizza and yummy ! i also want to say that the service here was amazing ! my waitress really was excellent , and i will be back for that alone !		4		1
i love costco for selling discounted gift cards for chompie 's ... that means more food for less money ! we come here often , so those discounted gift cards are perfect . a few of my fav 's that i get here : texas longhorn burger , $ 12.79 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=8iuxmt4uub2zbyvjajglqq#8iuxmt4uub2zbyvjajglqq http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=eb3o9un6ucvm2g4rt7naxg#eb3o9un6ucvm2g4rt7naxg chipotle ranch burger , $ 11.29 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=05nparfrm9annokwdi3bbq#05nparfrm9annokwdi3bbq western sliders , $ 9.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=mosyocno5z1xepbpqnw9_g#mosyocno5z1xepbpqnw9_g fried matzo balls , $ 5.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=ajdtxr9er8fir1i-cvojta#ajdtxr9er8fir1i-cvojta http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=fi7-9dxgnofwfjh45rljdg#fi7-9dxgnofwfjh45rljdg chicago hot dog , $ 6.69 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=fvua5q0adfrxipgn3qmwxa#fvua5q0adfrxipgn3qmwxa delancey street aka grandma sadie 's meatloaf , $ 11.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=l_ezd9fervmgqo9ughvpwa#l_ezd9fervmgqo9ughvpwa http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chompies-deli-scottsdale-2?select=si-jbwhtxcpiinh2gthkca#si-jbwhtxcpiinh2gthkca these entrees are all awesome ... and huge portions too , so bring a big appetite . the joint can get busy on the weekends , so we prefer to come during the weekdays when it 's slower . thanks to man vs food for introducing me to this place ! return factor - 100 %		4		1
i love this place . not only because it 's so close to the casa , but it is just fun and hip , in a good way . the boyfriend likes to come here too so that 's a plus . it is in an old old building , on the second floor , no elevator , stairs only , so get your workout on . great music always playing , fun old movies on the tvs , perfect lighting . the bathrooms are very nice too . single stalls , nicely decorated and clean , with mints too . they drink menu is awesome , however i am having a hard time getting past the moscow mule , sooo yummy ! if you have n't had one before you must get one ! it is served in a real copper mug , so they require a credit card to hold on to until you return you empty cup . which should n't be long , as you will drink is so fast and request another ! they have tons of beer and liquor to choose from . no draft beer though , no space and like i said before , no elevator , who in their right mind is going to carry a keg up those steps ? no one ! but the bottle beers are great ! they even have some of my faves ! go check them out !		4		1
my bff planned an awesome dinner here to start off the evening that was my bachelorette party . our party of 10 or so were seated smack in the middle -lrb- near the bull -rrb- at this huge round table and we had the most attentive waiting staff ever -lrb- our server gal was accommodating with the size , our orders and the bill ... and she even bought our table a few rounds of shots ! ... kickass !! -rrb- . the manager was attentive , too ... after convincing my drunken butt to get on the bull , he presented me with a gift bag with a hot pair of knickers inside that had their logo and some skanky phrase printed on it ... i 've never worn them , but , hell , i thought that was pretty great for making my evening feel special ! i 'd also like to point out that on this particular night , there was a huge hockey game -lrb- wings were playing -rrb- next door ... so even with a busy restaurant , their staff did a great job of providing awesome and memorable service . i do n't recall what i ate -lrb- probably because i did n't eat so much as i socialized -rrb- , but i do recall one of my gal friends -lrb- vegetarian -rrb- ordered their sweet potato fries and it came with this amazing marshmallow dip ... it was so yummy . . finger lickin ' good . i think this is a great place for anyone wanting to start off the night in a fun atmosphere with great staff . . i ca n't vouch for any of the food , ` cept the sweetpots but i was delighted it turned out to be such a perfect start to the night .		4		1
it 's confession time : i love a man and his name is joe johnston . not in the way you might think , but in an admiration and respect kind of way . johnston owns some of my favorite southeast valley eateries , like joe 's real bbq and liberty market . he also has another place , joe 's farm grill , that 's been featured on diners drive-ins and dives . built out of his childhood home , joe 's farm grill is at agritopia , a neighborhood being built around a farm in gilbert . many of the vegetables and herbs come directly from the farm and right into joe 's kitchen . it does n't get more local than this . you 'd have to squint really hard to figure out what the house may have looked like before it was converted into a restaurant . the place has a retro-modern flair with a nod to the 1960s . the lighting fixtures are groovy , baby . the ordering process is as straightforward as the menu approach the window and place your order . you 're given an electronic buzzer that gives you a good scare when your food is ready . i swear , i jump every time . the interior is relaxed and comfortable with plenty of open seating , though the best seats are actually outdoors under giant shade trees . also outdoors is the condiment bar with ranch dressing on tap . any place that has one of my favorite dips for french fries on tap is a winner in my book . the mainstream menu of burgers , pizzas and salads caters to the stroller pushing set that frequents joe 's as well as anyone who enjoys fresh , well-prepared food . my mouth started watering instantly when i saw how good the food looked . i quickly sank a bite into the farm burger -lrb- $ 7.99 -rrb- , which was well seasoned and perfectly juicy . weighing in at 6 ounces , then covered with a choice of cheese and grilled onions , this is one tasty burger . the thai chicken salad -lrb- $ 8.99 small / $ 9.99 large -rrb- takes local greens and veggies , crispy rice noodles and peanuts , then tosses them in spicy thai vinaigrette . this one was a disappointment because i felt that the dressing was unbalanced with too much sweet and sour and not enough spice . joe 's pizzas take on a slightly crisp char from being grilled rather than baked . knowing that joe does barbecue right at another of his restaurants , ordering the bbq chicken pizza -lrb- $ 8.99 -rrb- was a no brainer . smoked chicken breast , bacon , blue cheese , fresh tomato , red onion and with joe 's real bbq sauce sounded like a lot of ingredients , but they worked surprisingly well together . the tangy bleu cheese and smoky sweet bbq sauce created a yin and yang of flavors , a great combination . for dessert , joe 's has milk shakes -lrb- $ 3.99 -rrb- including vanilla , chocolate and seasonal fruit . so it 's with much love that i say i 'm looking forward to visiting again soon .		4		1
4.5 stars a helpful fellow yelper told me to try this place out after he read my review on delux , so i heeded his advice and went down the block to try it out . food : you 'll need 2 sliders -lrb- small burgers -rrb- to satisfy your hunger . i had a traditional beef and a moroccan lamb . the moroccan lamb was so good , it really did rival delux . to tell the truth , i 'm torn as to which place has better burgers now . the totz and rings were both good , especially with a spicy mayo-type sauce they come with . the traditional beef was nothing too amazing , a little dry to tell the truth . other burgers offered are ostrich , salmon , veggie , turkey , etc. . price : a little expensive for those tiny sliders , but what do you expect from old town scottsdale ? each slider was about $ 4-5 and a side of totz , rings , or sweet potato fries were all $ 3 . atmosphere : i love the layout of this place . even when eating inside , it 's like you are eating outside . on a nice day , this place was fun to eat at . service : the staff was very friendly and quick to serve . skinny : i 'm going back because of the moroccan lamb burger , to try ostrich , and since the place is so close to me . the moroccan lamb , while smaller , definitely is on my list for top burgers around . i 'll just have to get 2 of them , i guess . go to stax and try the moroccan lamb , its amazing . the only knock i have on this place , in comparison to delux , is its lack of good beer and its dwarf sized burgers .		4		1
i dug my latest experience here friday night . i had n't been by in a few years but lola coffee had locked their doors at 8:30 pm -lrb- wtf ??? -rrb- , so lucky for me , lux is right down the street . it was n't too busy although there was a very steady stream of people in and out . i had a small , non-fat sugar free vanilla latte -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- and picked up a homemade , oatmeal creme sandwich for $ 3 . pluses : i love the msmatched , kind-of random decor that makes you feel very comfortable . free wifi , and a wide variety of baked goods . i can always be sold on baked goods . this might be a weird plus , but i was totally loving their ice water with fresh oranges inside . i am probably the only person that never had this before , but who cares , i loved it . totally refreshing on a hot az night . neutral : the employees were n't exactly friendly but were n't rude , either ... just kind of indifferent . hmmm , correct that , they were very friendly with the regulars but i sort-of felt unwelcome at first but i quickly got over that . negatives : the music is too loud . maybe that was intentional towards the end of the night but i was having an extremely difficult time focusing on what i was studying . do n't get me wrong , i loved the music but it was a bit much . okay , alot much . bottom line , this is still a great little local coffee shop and i might be stopping here instead of lola next time ...		4		1
superb job by the copper blues staff during last night 's grand opening . the crowd was asses to elbows but we never waited terribly long for snacks or drinks . when you consider it was a hosted bar and the girls probably were n't making a ton of money in tips their effort becomes even more admirable . if you like a beer selection that runs 60 + deep , eclectic music , a killer patio with downtown views , and wading in a sea of attractive people , odds are strong you 'll have a good experience at copper blues . it really is a beautiful space with exposed ceilings , rich wood floors , gorgeous bars areas , and sumptuous attended bathrooms . aaron may 's menu is still a bit of an unknown based on last night 's samplers but it 's hard to doubt the man responsible for so many restaurant successes -lrb- vitamin t , over easy , mabel 's on main , etc. -rrb- . the big man was in attendance last night overseeing the finger food service , which included caprese on crackers -lrb- meh -rrb- , meatballs -lrb- strong -rrb- , tuna tartare -lrb- spicy and delicious -rrb- and sweet pea guacamole -lrb- five stars -rrb- . i 'm looking forward to getting busy with one of his entrees soon . copper blues is a big win for downtown .		4		1
i think kristin sums it up best with `` if roosevelt and fex had a baby , it would be sidebar . '' chic and trendy décor , small and intimate , playing cult favorites such as goonies and edward scissorhands -lrb- on albeit very ill-placed screens -rrb- , great second-story views , a very post-downtown work crowd ... it 's all there to be a downtown `` hidden gem '' that everybody knows about . i tried their cenpho tini -lrb- i had to hear the name about six times before realizing what was actually being said -rrb- - after it was described to me and thought it sounded delicious . bummer you have to walk around with a martini glass with red-slushie like liquid inside -lrb- i always think people are judging me as a carrie-wanna-be when i walk around with anything but a martini inside a martini glass ... prob because that 's exactly what i think when i see it -rrb- . it was $ 9 , but i still got two ! beers were $ 5 for imports , not bad ... they do serve some light apps including pita chips and hummus or spinach dip . i know this because when our group sat down at the far couches we were asked to move soon after by -lrb- i think -rrb- the owner . there was a pre-party set up for some group that would be coming in . unfortunately , since the group would take up all those white chairs and one couch area , there was really no where else for our group of five to sit -lrb- the other couch area was taken and after that it 's belly up or small hi-tops with two or three chairs apiece -rrb- . we squeezed in at the only other couch set up , and were subjected to annoyed looks by one woman in that party -lrb- although there was plenty of room and she clearly overhead the situation -rrb- . i was annoyed at first , but then begin to enjoy how fraught she was at our intrusion . ok , on to actual stuff you care about - bathrooms are great , chic and have mints for the taking -lrb- boo to the plastic ketchup-style bottle for soap -rrb- . the hummus was really good and the spinach dip spectacular . super friendly bartender first time , not too friendly -lrb- but helpful and patient -rrb- bartender the second time . i will definitely come back , especially to bring new people , as it makes quite a statement as a little hidden away trendy downtown bar .		4		1
this is a review for the chef 's table wine tasting dinner with clos du val . bang for the buck : 4/5 - the tasting dinner was nice and with the wine reasonably priced . i will go back . decor : 3/5 - a bit retro 70s , not my thing but done simply and it was fine ambiance : 3/5 - the room is open so not much privacy but the booth we were in gave a bit more than most spots service : 5/5 - they were great in all ways ... very attentive , the wine flowed well ; i had a bit too much : -rrb- food quality : 5/5 - all was excellent her ; top notch food quantity : 4/5 - could have used a bit more on the plates ... if i had not drank so much wine i would have still been hungry food flavor : 5/5 - it is rare i give 5 here but this place deserves it on this meal . everything was perfect ! food uniqueness & creativity : 4.5 / 5 - very creative , perfectly paired flavors and in the right proportions . last experience ... 02/07/2011 herb-dusted seared ahi -lrb- braised tuscan kale , meyer lemon oil + pancetta -rrb- - amazing ! honestly the best ahi i 've ever had . the herbs did not overpower but complimented warm orange braised fennel -lrb- baby spinach , shaved red onion + parmesan croutons -rrb- - very good , could have used more fennel as that was a bit lacking in qty . flat iron steak and duck sausage -lrb- sweet pea tortellini + shiitake mushrooms -rrb- - perfect flavors , perfectly cooked . would have liked to see one more slice of steak and more sausage ... normally i 'd have still been hungry chocolate truffle cake - this was the only item that was not great , it was so-so . flavors were average , and the cake part was a bit dry .		4		1
one of the last bastions of manhood , mortons . the cigar friendly bar . the ornate mahogany surroundings , reminding me of my attorney and how much money he makes . and the presentation . if you 've never been to morton 's , you 'll marvel at their menu presentation . a serving cart , wheeled to your table and on it , what appears to be the finest cuts of beef ever along with one cute surprise : a live lobster . and beleive me , you 'll know he 's alive when despite his rubber-banded claws , he precariously ooches his way off his dinner plate and heads your direction , you wo n't hear a fucking word the server is saying as you fixate on this three pound crustacean who looks like he 's hell-bent on sampling your crudites , so it 's best to bring a date along , one whose retention skills are n't limited to a two or three hour window , so you can ask her to repeat whatever it was the server just told you . and just in case your date is as dumb-as-a-fence-post , the server will give you a menu card the size of those index cards that helped you to fail your pre-meds . on it , you 'll notice things like mortons chopped salad , which i highly recommend . broccoli , which if your ' e into that whole cruciferous-cancer-crusade , is darned tasty when schmeared with their delicious hollandaise sauce . and the desserts . i think they float down from heaven on a little white pillow . just like the little white pillow your wedding ring was delivered on , but have since lost and replaced with a fifty dollar replica .		4		1
tucked away into an old central -lrb- and scary -rrb- neighbourhood , it was a bit hard to find in the dark . glad we did , though ! got a lemonade -lrb- made with fresh lemon juice -rrb- , the fried chicken with cheese biscuit sandwich and split an order of bacon cheddar fries . the chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy outer breading , thick and juicy meat inside . the biscuit was really tasty and flaky . it came with a few cubes of watermelon but i do n't like melon so those went untouched . we sat inside at the bar and everyone working inside was super nice and friendly . they have quite a few regulars and i could see why . the prices were a bit higher than i expected but they use totally local sourced ingredients and everything is prepared fresh so you 're paying for the quality just as much as the quantity . an order of cheddar bacon fries , a biscuit chicken sandwich with watermelon side , lemonade , and tip totalled to just over $ 21 .		4		1
went to lux for the first time yesterday to grab a hot tea and get some work done . overall , it was a great experience and i am looking forward to returning . the people who work there are pretty cool , they made me a couple great big mugs of hot tea and i had a crazy amazing brioche with huge chunks of sweet apples . awwww yeahhhh ! i would give it 5 stars but it is a bit on the pricey side , the atmosphere could be better and there are no seats at lunchtime . i was standing around for a good 15 minutes like a jerk with my laptop waiting for someone to leave . it seems like they might be able to make more room but its hard to say what the rest of the building is used for . at any rate , the best thing about this place is n't the place , or even the coffee and food - its the people . the employees are friendly and funny and the patrons are really , really cool . i met 2 people there i knew from twitter who introduced me to another friend , who in turn introduced me to yet another person . there is a great buzz in this place , lots of people thinking , working and talking all fueled by caffeine . i had a ton of great conversation and thoroughly enjoyed myself . looking forward to returning .		4		1
wildflower bread company knows how to make my mouth water . it started a couple of years ago when i discovered this flour filled bread company during a lunch break . i walked into the smell of fresh bread , pastries and desserts staring at me in the face and sandwiches and salads heaping with toppings . there is a well-known bread shop in tucson and i think wildflower is the closest i can get to it in phoenix . wildflower knows how to present their food in a way that makes the viewer hungry on the spot . i 've been in a room where wildflower displayed their products and between the breakfast foods , the desserts , the bread and the presentation , i asked myself several times if they would notice if i snagged a taste when nobody was looking . i did n't , but it took every ounce of willpower not to do so . i like wildflower because it 's a great valley shop to either come in for a meal or to pick up some treats for later . there 's enough seating so i 'm never without a table and the staff is friendly and attentive . i normally tweak the sandwiches when i visit and the bread and products are fresh and fabulous . well done wildflower !		4		1
carly 's has a bit of a reputation among phoenicians and downtowners . it 's tiny , so they usually have a maximum of three people working there at any given time . most people discover carly 's on a first friday visit , when it 's wall-to-wall and completely overwhelmed . there 's a name for that , you know . it 's called `` amateur hour . '' the people-in-the-know realize that carly 's is a great place to avoid whenever there 's a crowd on roosevelt , and a great place to hang out when it 's locals-only -lrb- i. e. not much of a crowd at all -rrb- . in fact , carly 's is one of not-very-many restaurants or bars in the area open every day of the week , with late hours . additionally , it has a full liquor license , with hard liquor options . the other places in the area -lrb- the roosevelt , lost leaf -rrb- only serve beer and wine . lost leaf does n't even serve food . the point i 'm trying to make is , carly 's has a niche . a `` sunday afternoon and i 'm hungry and there 's no place nearby open '' niche . literally , we walked past the subway in the cronkite building and it had closed . lame ! the point is , carly 's has decent food -lrb- maybe a tad over-priced in this economy , but hardly a deal-breaker -rrb- , the service is not great , but not intolerably bad -lrb- aside from first friday , of course -rrb- , and the vibe is actually quite good . the last time i was here i shared a pita chip-based appetizer , and it was delicious . i went on to eat the pear sandwich , featuring pear , brie , and proscuitto . it was fantastic ! additionally , i loved the modest mouse they were rocking in the background , although i was n't sure what was going on with the sub speakers . it was a little unbalanced . anyway , i 'm sure i 'll be back soon . probably not on a first friday , but on a sunday afternoon or another time when it seems like most of the other places are closed , i 'll be here .		4		1
i love costco ! i am a costco junkie . i get all kinds of stuff here and yes i have occasionally even bought clothes . now in retrospect i think i have bought all of my swimsuits here for the last 6 years . hey back off they carry speedo 's for about 20 bucks now that 's a deal ! i love the shrimp cocktail here i get that at least once a week you get like 30 beautiful shrimp for 10 bucks with sauce and lemon . the chicken salad is very good . i always get , french beans & hard salami as well . the prices for the cheeses are really good as well . i get my puppies dog food here too ! you ca n't beat the ready made food either . the roasted chicken is fantastic ! the cuts of beef are amazing . sometimes about half way through my shopping i will call the food court and order an everything pizza . once i go to the checkout i let them know i ordered a pizza and they ring me up there and i go pick it up on my way out . also the twist frozen yogurt is yummy ! for 10 bucks that 's a good pizza ! do park in the back on the montebello side , or if it works for you take the light rail .		4		1
if the staff here is indeed `` well-oiled , '' which i believe it to be , that makes the consumers `` well-watered . '' and by `` well-watered , '' of course , i mean hammered . the protocol and staff hedge risk as much as they conceivably can , but idiots like the people i hang out with will do absolutely everything in their power to break the rules , and , if possible , kill themselves . it is not uncommon to witness beer bongs floating along side you and standard operating procedure for relieving oneself entails the highly complicated `` float 'n pee . '' multitasking at its finest . needless to say , the river gets a little gross . but , in all candor there has been a significant cleanup of the whole thing in recent years so it is nowhere near as gnarly as it once was . wear your sunscreen and your thick skin to ward off the drunk idiots that surround you . in the case that you plan on being one of the drunk idiots , you 'll probably be in my ranks , passed out and painfully sunburned by the end of the ride . see you out there !		4		1
i picked up a copy of a natural remedies book a few months ago but was dissuaded from trying any of the more complex recipes for facial cleansers , moisturizers , and home care because i had to order herbs online and i really like being able to see what i 'm purchasing . now that i live in phoenix i am blessed to have found chakra 4 herb which holds a cornucopia of herbal concoctions . i went in with a list of herbs that frankly i 've never heard of and they had all of them and dozens more . the store is tucked on the interior path of the town & country strip mall and even though it 's small it is well organized and spacious and they have even opened up their business with a cafe ! the menu seems limited but delicious , i did n't stop to eat as i was on a shopping spree through the area but i will definitely be back for a meal and an infusion ! you can buy herbs by the ounce and they are somewhat expensive ... yet less so than having to buy in bulk online and pay for shipping . i would say the range was about $ 2 - $ 4 for each ounce of herby things i got yesterday . really friendly staff too , i am so excited to try out making my own natural beauty products !		4		1
i have only been to the orange table twice , but it still ranks as one of my all time favorite breakfast spots . i only wish i lived a little closer so it would be easier to enjoy more often . then again , maybe it 's better for my waistline that it is n't closer . the orange table is n't very big , so there could be a little bit of a wait . our party of six decided to get a delicious coffee drink while we were waiting . mexican chai = delicious ! i also like that they serve breakfast almost all day , this way you can wake up from a long night of festivities and still catch the best meal of the day . at first , we were a little shocked by the horrible customer service from our server , however , the food easily made up for it . her scary look and lack of emotion quickly earned her the nickname `` wednesday '' -lrb- not to her face , of course , we 're not that rude ! -rrb- . the second time i was there , the server was actually friendly , that was nice . the jalapeño pecan pancakes were amazing as well as the greek omelet . since they are a bakery too , i was able to enjoy some delicious olive toast with my meal . several different types of hash , each one making my mouth water just from the menu description . if you 're a stickler for perfect service , you are just setting yourself up for disappointment if you go here . if you goal is a delicious meal and you are n't on a specific time line , go to the orange table .		4		1
what 's girl to do when she turns 30 ? have a spa day and live it up ! i decided to start my third decade off in style with my favorite things ; wine chocolate and the spa . i called a few days ahead and booked the relaxation massage along with the spa pedicure . i also convinced a girlfriend to take the day off with me to relax and unwind . we arrived and were greeted by smiling faces with menus for us to choose our spa lunch . we were then given the tour of the large facilities and were on our way to being pampered . i kept thinking why i had not taken advantage of this place sooner . i do live in the area and it seems a shame to not frequent this spa . the relaxation massage was just what i needed to loosen up after a busy work week . as soon as i was able to get replenished my lunch arrived ; salad , bread , fruit and cookie . the portion was so surprisingly large that i could not finish it ! up next ; we decided to experience the steam room . my skin felt about 10 years younger ! i am convinced i need a steam shower in my bathroom . after lounging around for a few hours we ended the day with pedicures . the staff is so professional and they use great products . i ca n't go to cheap $ 20 nail salons b/c their crappy lotions give me a rash so it 's nice when you can have the entire experience ; ambiance , nice products and great price . i will sure check out the first wed of the month special !		4		1
do n't worry windsor , we 'll get to you . first though , i need to talk about your assets . the brown tartan patio chairs . they 're perfect . brown 's not used enough in decoration and i think it 's usually way better than black any day . now . let me just say you are a fantastic host . the fact that the rectangular bar and the patio are the two main focal points really makes my day . too many establishments focus on the indoors . the decor is exquisite , and nearly as good as what i 'd do : -rrb- i insisted on being seated on the patio and do not regret this decision for one minute . i had n't quite decided what i was going to eat as a main course or drink that evening ... but i knew i was devouring the shit out of that cheddar fondue . and i was right . there was a lot though , and i 'm glad i had a friend to help devour it . i think we both agreed it was the best pretzel bread we 've had . the pork and the sausage were great additions and i 'm a sucker for apples and cheese . another point for you sir . the server kindly agreed to allow the flavor of the ginger in the no. 89 to rise above the pear and i appreciate him for that . it came out in a cute glass and lasted me through my courses . not too strong , not too weak . i was saving room for churn -lrb- how can you not -rrb- , so i settled on the waldorf chicken salad for dinner . however , the layout of your menu confused me . in the same space below it , it listed different additions such as salmon , shrimp and chicken so i thought i needed to clarify i wanted chicken . then i confused the server . apparently , those options are for the other salad items . but the layout of the menu layout implies the opposite . you may want to reconsider the organization of the salad section . one of the best waldorf salad 's i 've had though . great presentation . my date for the evening had the windsor burger with mac & cheese , of which i sampled the mac & cheese and one of the wine smothered onions . that will be my next attempt . everything 's pretty reasonably priced and there 's a great selection of beer and wine available as well as well thought out cocktails . i had a few different people at the table that night , refilling waters , taking plates . . and it took a little while to get a bill . i was n't sure if i could ask anyone . . did i need to wait for my server who became a little more scarce ? i do n't know . overall though ... amazing . you are very rapidily climbing the charts .		4		1
it 's 5:00 am on friday and i do n't want to make breakfast . fortunately , there is a solution right down the street . the daughters always rave about this place , but this is the first time for me . i am greeted warmly by the aroma of freshly made donuts as i enter the clean and well-lit bosa . right up front is a glass case with all sorts of hot , sugary goodness . glazed seems to be the most popular as there are sugar , chocolate , and flavored glazes , some with sprinkles and some not . i picked up a dozen for the family - hey , three each is not too much , right ? i got some boston cremes right off the rack , still warm - definitely the best way to get donuts . the price was right , i made it out the door with more than half a twenty still in my pocket . unfortunately , when i got home , the boston cremes were missing the filling and those were special-ordered by the fam . guess i 'll just have to try again another time .		4		1
hi cassie . praying monk , an ` american beer café ' in old town scottsdale . i have no idea how i walked in right at opening time and all looked pretty good considering the size of last night 's party . looking around , there was no one sleeping it off , a good sign . marsella , i would have loved to have hooked you up with those comps last night . i usually am a pretty good provider . lunch today is a blanche de bruxelles $ 6 never had this beer before and after drinking it , i really believe this is a girls beer , i do n't know . i looked it up and the moniker on the label is a boy peeing , lol , i had to look at the beer color in my photograph again . thankfully it was well hydrated beer . next time i shall man-up and get the draft chemay . while i was waiting for my lunch plate i was checking out the detail of the house and chatting with cassie , a scrumptious suprise . the woods in the restaurant are beautiful . the floor is a medium-dark stained herringbone oak . much of the wall covering is weathered grey timbers , ceiling looks like morning wood with the exposed rafters . hot stuff . my meal is a triple decker clubhouse sandwich with slaw . $ 9 looks like may served up traditional history , yet broke the rules to have a little fun . the cold plate was summer savory . today i owe a bit of gratitude to the pleasantly piquant minds of praying monk .		4		1
ohhhhh soooo eatery ! i 'd be so hungry if i left you now cause i do n't know where to look for brews i just do n't know how ! ohhhhh soooo eatery ! how i depend on you to give me brews when i need it right on time for happy hour ! -lrb- lyrics - the chi-lites - oh girl -rrb- oh ! so good and worth your time . at first glance i did n't know what this place was . i made my stop across the street at jt 's . finally , i 'm glad a made a stop here . felt like walking into a neighborhood bar that was full of ... well . . my neighbors ! they have a pretty awesome back patio , but that 's not to say that the front is lacking . dogs are welcomed up front to hang with patrons . the place itself seemed pretty retro and had that summer camp feel . they have a huge selection of micro brews and what totally weirded me out was how the bartender remembers which brew was in which tap , since there were no signs or logos attached . just plain taps ! kudos to the person that has to remember all of it ! i ordered a burger with cheese and a side of fries . my friends ordered the antipasto platter which came with elk meat -- cool ! my burger was totally awesome with the bacon and cheese . the patty was nice and juicy while the cheese just oozed over it nicely . the bun was nice and soft and do n't forget to order some nice and crispy fries on the side . overall and the bread they used was definitely larger and doughy compared to what i was used to . the antipasto platter was great and came with honey mustard and some sort of salsa like sauce . the meats and pickled veggies was what made it delicious ! never had elk but was n't bad at all . the pickled veggies were pungent and hit up my sinuses where it need to . overall , good start and good experience - enjoy !		4		1
`` eat when you 're hungry and eat 'til you 're happy '' ... one of the rules i live by : -rrb- one of the simpler rules , really ... so much less difficult to deal with than other rules : * `` neither a borrower , nor a lender be '' - sure , great advice when the economy is in the crapper , but you might want to think about levering up in boom times : -rrb- * `` do not covet thy neighbor 's wife '' - hey , if i had n't done a little coveting , the beautiful carin would not be my blushing bride today : -rrb- * 9.80665 m/s2 = 1g - it 's not just a good idea , it 's the law -lrb- probably ... in this universe : -rrb- and so it came to pass that i was , in fact , hungry after my run and before i hit the driving range yesterday ... one of my buddies called and suggested la tolteca . i said `` who ? '' ... the toltec ? but wes seems to know his mexican food and i seem to enjoy decent mexican food , so off i went ... to a really interesting part of town : -rrb- i guess i do n't get out much ... hookers ambling up and down the street at 11:30 am ? ... people urinating behind dumpsters in the parking lot ? ... the unmistakable -lrb- and appetite enhancing -rrb- aroma of ganga being smoked nearby ? i do n't see much of that from my deck in old town : -rrb- i also do n't get tamales that are this good in old town , either ... m ` mmm , m ` mmm good ... with a great big side of atmosphere : -rrb- i chose wisely and thoroughly enjoyed my number 3 ... two plump , succulent and spicy beef tamales , covered with red sauce ... i added a couple of little plastic cups of habanero salsa to my styrofoam plate and headed for a table in the well muraled dining area -lrb- the murals really are nice ... an artistic depiction of life on van buren , near la tolteca ... bright and colorful : -rrb- btw , la tolteca is a market and bakery , too ! if you happened to want ... oh , say a beer or 4 at lunch , you can swing through the market and pick up a six pack of bud for about what you 'd pay for one beer at loco patron ... and after lunch , you can grab a cupcake on your way out for about 95 cents -lrb- about 3 % of what you 'd pay for a crapcake at sprinkles : -rrb- wes and i chatted and ate ... the tamales were excellent ... the company was excellent ... i was charmed , by both la tolteca itself -lrb- a sweet little outpost -rrb- and by the grittiness of this stretch of van buren -lrb- a street that gives us all a glimpse of how a post apocalyptic world might look -rrb- . it was worth the trip , for the food , for the look into another world and for a chance to catch up with my pal : -rrb- go during daylight hours ... park in the very safe `` hooker patrolled '' parking lot ... avert your eyes from the public urination -lrb- `` ma'am ... that 's really not appropriate '' : -rrb- and have a super burrito or a couple of tamales at la tolteca ... eat 'til you 're happy : -rrb-		4		1
my maiden voyage to rnr started off shaky ; my so and i almost turned around when we first opened the door because there was an annoying dj who was just loud as hell . who thinks this is a good idea for sunday morning , when all the poor , the downtrodden , and the hungover venture out for breakfast ? i thought the club closed at 2 am last night . despite the dance remixes of bon jovi and too-cool-for-you crowd predominantly in their early 20s , grandma and grandpa decided to stay and indulge in some sundried tomato and goat cheese scrambled eggs , chambord french toast , coffee , and bloody marys . i fully admit that the strip of bacon shoved in the bloody mary is totally surprising and off-putting for a vegetarian , but it is certainly creative . the bloody was tasty , but slightly bland and nothing special . the scrambled eggs and hash browns -lrb- well done , natch -rrb- were huge and delicious , with plenty of tender sun dried tomatoes , but i had to save room for french toast mountain . good thing i did , and it 's a damn good thing fatty wore her stretchy jeggings , because i slurped my half of the french toast down and practically licked the plate clean . it was , bar none , the best french toast i have ever had . stuffed with sweet cream cheese , drenched in boozy raspberry sauce , and crowned with great fluffy piles of fresh whipped cream , it was a flavorful little orgasm on a plate . despite the remix of `` smells like teen spirit '' -lrb- poor kurt is spinning in his grave -rrb- and slightly questionable service -lrb- forgotten english muffin -rrb- , we will be back -- but only on a day when we have nothing else to do but lay around the house , buzzed and in a lethal food coma ... just yum .		4		1
the valley ho really needs to change it 's name to `` mad men : the experience '' because everything about this place is meticulously retro-chic and stylish to the max . seriously come here if you want to channel don draper . an enviable location in scottsdale with old town scottsdale 's plethora of restaurants , bars and clubs at your doorstep . my generously sized signature tower room was comfortable and afforded magnificent views of the valley and true to the rest of the hotel , stylish yet comfortable . the beds are like sleeping you on your own little slice of heaven . the bathroom with separate tub and shower was huge and had great amenties -lrb- love the icelandic moonflower products ! -rrb- and the shower has a little ledge you can plant your bottom on whilst bathing in case you 're a little tipsy and need stabilization . the pool is a lively , thumping club by day with beautiful people enjoying all varieties of adult beverages . the pool closes at sunset so the crowd has just enough time to shower , change and then head to old town for the evening . the bar and lounge are a fun place to hang out and grab a bite and enjoy some cocktails all in the mid-century atmosphere . the valley ho is a destination unto itself and attracts a youthful crowd in a stylish atmosphere that 's not too pretentious . definitely a one-of-a-kind experience for those who are sick and tired of drab accommodations with no personality .		4		1
i liked it . the restaurant is small and many of the tables were reserved , so we sat at the bar . from the moment we walked in we had nothing but good service , from being greeted , to our bartender/server , to the bussers , and even another server who had his own tables but was friendly and thanked us for coming in . bread is fresh and warm , mixed drinks are strong , and the caprese salad is awesome - several slices of tomato and soft mozzarella garnished with basil , kalamata olives , and roasted red peppers . there were entirely too many fantastic-sounding dishes to choose from . i went with penne pasta with a light gorgonzola cream sauce and sausage , my hot date went with lasagna . although i could have used a little more gorgonzola kick on my pasta , it was still cooked perfectly and the sauce was clearly homemade , not heavy , and went well with the sausage . i had a few bites of the lasagna as well and the red sauce was pretty good - not too acidic , not too sweet . this restaurant also provides a perfect amount of food - not too much that you 're going to have a ton of leftovers , but you will be pleasantly full and pricing is appropriate to that - reasonable to inexpensive . while we ate , we noticed several pizza orders were picked up . more than several . maybe one every three minutes . i am definetly going to try the pizza next time i come in !		4		1
yasu is not at all what you would expect by looking at it from the outside . it is a rather small restaurant , but that adds to the ambiance . we went on a saturday night and it was pretty full . customers ranged from families to couples out on date night . we were greeted immediately and the service was excellent . the server explained everything on the menu -lrb- there are a few different menu 's -rrb- and offered his advice after asking what we were looking for to eat . the drinks were good and the food was fresh . the menu offers items you do n't typically find at other sushi restaurants in the valley . the boneless ribs on the 5.00 menu were excellent as was the seafood fondue . the prices do get a little expensive with some items , so it is worth checking out during the times where they are running the food specials if you are really hungry . overall a really nice and unexpected experience . we will be back again to eat there soon !		4		1
got ta love it when fellow foodies put together tweetups that involve food and drink , even better when that get together happens at a restaurant featured on diners , drive-ins & dives that you 've wanted to try out for ages . kirti dwivedi and susie timm decided to gather tweeps at the grand opening of los taquitos ' newest location on 16th and glendale avenues in mid-town phoenix for a nosh and adult beverages . thirty or so twitter and facebook users responded to the tweetvite , showed up , queued up and got down to the business of eating . first up a margarita made with tres agaves tequila and freshly squeezed blood orange juice . i 'm a big fan of the tangy sweetness of blood oranges and am glad to see them used in this upscale taqueria . the much talked about ` bombiero ' burrito was served up as my entrée , full of slow cooked carnitas , pico de gallo , and rice wrapped in a flour tortilla and bathed in los taquitos signature sweet and fiery ` bombiero ' sauce . i found the pork to be perfectly cooked , tender and juicy , the pico fresh and vibrant but the sauce was a bit overpowering in it 's sweetness . i was really looking for this sauce to have a much higher level of heat and spice , but over-all , sweet was the strongest note that i experienced . in my opinion , this sauce would be perfect if the sweetness was dialed down and the heat increased . other tweeps at my table enjoyed their carne asada tacos with rice and beans and we all munched on that taco shop staple , chips and salsa/guacamole . i 'm looking forward to trying several other dishes including the tacos al pastor and am quite happy that los taquitos has opened up on my side of the valley . if you fancy a bit of up-scale taqueria cuisine , get to one of los taquitos ' locations and have a go at the menu , you 'll certainly not be disappointed .		4		1
my wife and i have been here about a half dozen times and is one of our favorite little bars in phoenix . we always try to stop by when we are on one of our self-made light rail dinner/pub crawls like we had last weekend . the roosevelt is pretty much just a neat little older home converted into a bar . there are a bunch of tables and chairs scattered throughout the `` home 's '' rooms . it is all very laid back and cozy . they have a pretty good beer and wine selection as well . my absolute favorite is the rogue hazelnut brown they have on tap . omg sooo good ! that is pretty much all i get when i go . anyway , this was our last stop of the evening so the place was a bit crowded . this place gets super crowded so get there early if you want a place to sit . i am not a real super huge fan of standing at a bar so sometimes the roosevelt ticks me off in that regard , but i guess good for them for being so popular . luckily during this visit we only had to stand for about 1/2 hour then i was able to quickly pounce when people left from their table . my anger about standing for so long quickly faded away and the roosevelt once again became a great little bar to have a few beers , chit-chat and people watch all from a comfy chair .		4		1
