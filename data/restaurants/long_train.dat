i had not been to bev mo for a long time and when walking around i remembered why this place is so overpriced . save yourself some money and head over to total wine plus a lot better craft beer selection .		1		0
100 + reviews and this is my worst . dinner at mimi 's cafe is an experience -- a very dull disappointing experience , at least at this branch . i hope other locations are better , but i am beginning to think that the brain trust at mimi 's corporate central has a disdain for salt , pepper , or any other spice . for example , my pot roast dinner , including a mixture of carrots and broccoli and a scoop of mashed potatoes , all heaped on one half of the plate , contained not a jot of taste . the gelatenous brown `` gravy '' that was slobbered wholesale on the mashed potatoes and pot roast was a miracle -- how could they have managed to take the salt out of canned gravy ? or did they actually make it themselves ... on purpose ??? my wife 's meal -lrb- chicken crepes -rrb- was just as bad . the corn chowder did , i admit , have a little seasoning , but it was the thickness of school paste and tasted much the same . the pork sliders had a sweet bbq sauce , but the pork itself was mush . the restaurant was clean and comfortable , and the service proper but distant and not very attentive . but the food is the big problem here . i hope the cook staff at this mimis is just ignorant , uncaring , or hungover , because otherwise there is no hope whatsoever for this chain . note : i have also eaten at mimi 's for breakfast several times . although better than dinner , mimi 's breakfasts are pretty ordinary . the bakery items are , in general , better than the egg dishes , pancakes and waffles -- all of which are bland . the muffins that accompany most meals are a cut above average .		1		0

i came here years ago to see henry rollins spoken word . -lrb- totally awesome by the way : five stars . -rrb- the seats here though were absolutely horrendous ! now i 'm 5 ' 11 '' so i 'm used to not having a lot of leg room so i 'm used to sitting sideways so my knees are n't banging into the seat in from of me . here , legs to the side and i 'm still rammed up against the next row . it was like being in a three hour yoga pose . i have never before and never since seen rows of seats so close to eat other . only my sister in law could sit comfortably and she 's 5 ' 1 '' . come on celebrity theatre , just a couple more inches . size really does matter . if anyone told you otherwise , they were lying .		1		0
this place was way to pricey for me , especially having a `` laid back '' atmosphere . it is a trendy place and i feel like sucker for giving them my business . you do n't pay top dollar for that kind of atmosphere . and paying 12 to 14 dollars for a little martini is outrageous . the food is good , not great . there are plenty of hole in the wall sushi places that give you great food for what you pay for .		1		0
if it was n't for the bad food i would go here more than once or twice a year . the meat was dry and tough in my first entree and not edible in my second . now when my wife drags me here to watch a movie , i order a salad only . because they do catering , i have a suspicion that they serve up left over food from catered events to their restaurant customers . the service is ok . they have a couple of generic draft beers . everything is overpriced . caveat emptor if you order an entree .		1		0
i went with another yelper who had gone to the yelp event at citizen 's , however , we did n't have the same experience as she had at the yelp event . we had cups of iced tea -lrb- starbucks -rrb- that the hostess did n't say we could n't bring in , a server just came by and was about to take them until we asked why . . i asked how a particular drink was . . was it sweet , the waitress said it was more savory which i thought well it sounded good . . umm skip the aviation , even had my friends try it and they too thought i should send it back however i got the feeling that i would be charged for the drink and charged again for whatever else i ordered , so i let it sit on the table and see how long it would take the waitress to notice . . never did . . another server/busboy came by to take my plate , and i just told him to take the drink , he never questioned nor asked what was wrong . . all in all poor service . we had the mussel chowder . . skip it ! the 8 mussels makes the bowl look full , underneath , hardly any leeks and potatoes but a lot of celery ! and the chowder was really runny . and for $ 9 , seriously for mussels which are one of the cheapest seafood to purchase . when i was going to the restroom , i noticed to ladies totally bored and annoyed , just sitting side by side with just water in front of them . i thought to myself , have they been served or asked ?? i walked back out and they were out the door pretty quickly . would i go back ? umm . . no . . the pricing of the food is similar to fez and other foodie spots and reasonable , however the quality and the quantity not so much ... oh . . and the service . . i 've had better .		1		0
ok , first time i was here was for lunch . i had the cheeseburger and it was one of the best hamburgers i had ever had . noticed the pool , darts , pinball , golden tee , and ancient bowling game and thought i would take my friends back there and share this incredible place . two days later , for dinner and drinks , 3 of us went in and saw only one person working on a friday night . she was cooking , bartending , handling money , scratching her head , shaking hands , cleaning bar tops , running dishes , etc. ... did i mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time ? we ate our dinners , disgustedly , thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it . she was entertaining , all over the place , yelling , throwing things , etc. . i 'm pretty nieve , and did n't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time . so there we have it , a restaurant i thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that does n't observe any food safety laws or regulations . i 'll be getting my hepititis c test next week . -lrb- joking ... kinda -rrb-		1		0
had lunch there . service was great . good atmosphere . like the overall design . the food on the other hand was absolutely horrible . the pretzel fondue to start was okay . nothing exciting . we had a cheese burger that was thin , dry and really something you should get at mcdonalds for a dollar -lrb- not $ 9 ! -rrb- tabbouleh salad was just not good . over all i would not recommend . bad food .		1		0
this place is the white-trash chipotle . the food is mediocre at best . i mean seriously , how can you just up and steal chipotle 's idea ! there 's no creativity there . the habenaro salsa is flavorless and not hot at all . seriously ? i asked for hot , not some yellowish tomato concoction for the people who ca n't handle real salsa ! at least chipotle has hot salsa -lrb- not too hot either but much better -rrb- for a fast americanized mexican food . of course i much rather have the real deal but i do like chiptole for what it is . not this crap that qdoba tries to serve up . the chicken is over seasoned and highly spiced/herbed you can barely taste the chicken . the fajita veggie were the same . the product looked of very low quality . oxidizing guacamole and lettuce . the meat looked unappetizing as well . just not at the level of chipotle . although i have been here twice , this is the last time for me . i have been to one in denver and for some reason thought it was better . so maybe it 's management but i can say the food is less than good . i much rather go to chiptole than this wannabe ! employees were dumber than a bag of frijoles ! this place has the worst `` mexican '' food i have ever had next to a pre made burrito from 7-11 or a burrito from taco bell . just disgusting food .		1		0
waited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list . she said she was n't skipping me , that there were places for two people to sit , but not one . the last time i checked , one person is able to sit where two people can sit . i do n't give a pretty fuck that you are trying to turn more tables , if i am waiting 30 mins , when it 's my turn , its my turn . if someone that came after me , sits before i do , you are skipping me . there is no arguing with me about it . wo n't be back .		1		0
i have now been here 3 times and my first time was great , as i stated in my first review . but my last 2 visits have not been a pleasant experience . i went for brunch a few months ago with a group of ladies , 25 of us , and our service was pretty terrible . first we had confirmed the number of people in our party the day before but they still seemed unprepared for such a large party . our server was pretty rude as well , i swear she never cracked a smile . our party arrived within 30 minutes of or reservation time , some right on time others a little late and we had the large center table and 2 booths . our server stated after only 15 minutes and 12 of us being there that she could n't hold the tables if we all were n't coming . we assured her we were and everyone did show up . it was the continual little things , not refilling water , not bringing fresh , chilled orange juice when we ordered another bottle of champagne for mimosas . rolling her eyes and sighing when we asked for the check to be split and never saying thank you before we left . last night was so bad i wo n't be back . i met with a friend for their pizza and wine special which i was super excited for . the biggest problem was the bartender , she was rude , inattentive and totally cut corners when it came to making us happy . we ordered a pizza and one of our toppings was goat cheese but only on one half . when our pizza arrived it had mozzarella on one half and goat cheese on the other when the mozzarella should have been on the whole pizza . this is a totally honest mistake and i can see where the confusion could have been in what we said and what she translated it to mean . but instead of apologizing she was a bit argumentative over what she thought we said when we ordered . to make matters worse instead of having a new pizza made she asked the kitchen to just add the mozzarella on the side that was missing it and re-fire it . what ?! it was charred in some places , dried out and all together simply not very good . we were starving and contemplated sending it back , but twice in one night just seemed too much . there was a nice gentleman that worked there who asked how are pizza was , bartender chick never did , we actually had to get her attention the first time to send it back . we were in the middle of explaining why we did n't really like it when ms. snarky says `` if you wanted me to have a new one made for you , you should have just asked . '' wtf ?! i have worked in restaurants and usually when someone sends something back you remake it ! you should have done that in the first place ! she was so rude and it was really hard to even be polite to her at this point but i remained in the acting like a lady zone . the did take it off our bill and gave us a free dessert . let me be clear , it was the gentleman who gave us the free dessert , he was very charming and apologetic . if ms. snarky was nice about everything i would n't be writing off maizies forever , but the icing on the cake was when she sat at the bar one seat down from us to eat her dinner . i think that is very unprofessional but that was n't what bothered me most . the lady that took her place behind the bar and ms. snarky had a 10 minute bitch fest complaining about customers and how they can be such a pain in the ass . the proceeded to regale each other with stories of how customers have annoyed them . we paid our bill and left . ms. snarky did n't say one word to us on our departure . there are so many great places in the same area with a much nicer staff . those are the places i will be spending my money at .		1		0
birthday signup we got the $ 30 gift card and went over mid week . another one of my favorite places . the service was terrible . the guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours . i do n't think it 's supposed to take that long . i even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help . nothing changed . i do n't think the manager cared because i did n't see him helping . but the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems . the cook who i think was also new . and it could have been the server . but he did n't make enough . and he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person . then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday . and i think the first person took a taste of it . then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there was n't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl . pretty sad i had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade .		1		0
fyi if you smell something burning its your sandwich . a chicken deluxe and a captain cooler usually makes me happy except when they burn the s out of it -lrb- see pic -rrb- . captian you better check your girls they are messing up my sandwich experience ! maybe i just came at the wrong time ? i would usually give four stars but due to this tragic sandwich i just unwrapped they ca n't be saved .		1		0
place is still not maintaining equipment . beware of twice yearly $ 15 `` service fee '' . this is in addition to your dues ! this is supposed to be for maintenance of gym . it is not happening . the place is getting dirty . pubes and dust all around the machines . this place is going downhill fast ! i am going to start taking pictures and posting them on here .		1		0
ok , this is not a food review . ... let 's start with the good . great space , beautiful , modern industrial space , good outdoor space . well , that ends the good . so , on a sunday before a spring training game i showed up hoping for a fun brunch before some work . after checking in and requesting the `` rare '' and unavailable breakfast menu , we were seated on the upstairs patio ... and then the wait began . and ... we waited ... and waited ... and wait , that table over there apparently has a server . oh apparently he is n't our server . ok , well the table behind us complained . so , that table got a `` well i 'm not your server but i am helping out . '' so ... 20 minutes in , hmmm , maybe this place ca n't plan for the reality pre-game giant 's game , or maybe they think this is suede or some other `` club '' where people come in despite the horrendous lack of attention to detail and service ... but hey , we can wait a few minutes longer ... but should we need to wait 20 minutes ? ok , let 's go to the bar . whoa ! all the waiters are hanging out around the computer entry system ... `` umm , dude , what 's the code for water ? '' ummm , hey , there are 6 of you here , how about serving some tables . i 'm no expert , just a suggestion . let 's leave . so ... i ca n't speak to the food , but a good source tells me it matches the service . disappointing at best ! please do n't waste that building ! either get your act together or hand over the space . scottsdale is full of wannabes ... it does n't need another .		1		0
really bad . the mac n cheese tasted like it was powdered cheese with no bite/spice . also , we thought it was odd that they brought out the mac n cheese 5 minutes before our ribs came out . we returned it . we were told that they have a new menu . the waiter was very nice , recommended the green beans and comped our side . the green beans and the local beer were the best part of the meal . we got the whole rack of ribs and only ate half and left the rest . it was dry , not tender , no flavor . this , even though we were told it was ranked phoenix best ?? then our bill came out wrong - they added an additional $ 22 to the bill by accident . mistakes happen , but this was overall just bad . wo n't return .		1		0

seems to be a recurring theme that the owner/manager of this particular branch is rude to customers . the one star is for her attitude . maybe she should read yelp and get her act together . i love nbc , but the only one i have used is the one in ` tukee . i 'd advise that one if you want good , polite service . the chocolate chocolate chip cake is awesome . and the red velvet is above decent , also . prices are high , but worth it in taste . the food is 4.5 stars for sure .		1		0

went with a groupon - probably the most disappointed i have been with one . i am not sure what i had as it did not resemble what i had ordered -lrb- i thought anyway -rrb- and it was tasteless . i just wanted to be done and really did not want to order anything else . i have tried many mexican restaurants in the valley and this has been my only disappointment , normally i am pleasantly surprised . sorry folks .		1		0

i used to love this place . now i am very disappointed , for one there is no vegetarian item on the menu that are not a side dish . also when ordering things and making them vegetarian they seemed really bothered by it . lastly they broke my husbands debit card and did n't say anything about it , how sad is that . i was really disappointed by the whole meal , from start to finish . will not be back .		1		0

if there is a zero star , i will do so . this has been the worst place i have ever been in a long time . i ordered a mango mojito , and got some berry drink instead . when i asked my server about it , the response i got was `` oh , i thought that 's what you ordered '' and `` i will bring you mango mojito next time . '' both my friend 's salad and my entree had to be send back . -lrb- which she never do and i rarely do . -rrb- she ordered a blackberry brie salad . she got pecan cranberry instead . we were told the manager made her second salad , which is 1/2 the size , with 4 blackberry , 4 tiny see through slices of brie , still has the pecan for the unknown reason , and few lettuce . when i got my med-rare ahi tuna entree , my friend thought i have gotten salmon because it 's not the healthy redish tuna color but the whiteish pink color . it was way over cooked ! when i address this to our waiter , he just looked at it and say `` yeah , that 's way over cooked '' and walked away . it 's not till minutes later he asked if i would like them to remake the tuna . the second tuna i got was not any better . it tasted like they put 5 times the seasoning for the whole plate on the little fishes that they serve . it was way over salted and almost tasted gross . and funny thing was , it was then i really came to appreciate how tart my berry drink is . it took that saltiness off the tuna . anyway , with the price of the menu , we were really hoping for a better experience . we did n't get that . we got surprises and questions about how a restaurant can screw up so much for one table . mind you , there were maybe only three tables when we first got there on a saturday night . -lrb- and the only table left when we got our food . -rrb- we both agree this place do n't have a very good chance . but even if it does , i will never return !!!!		1		0
its amazing how much they are charging for their flavorless greasy food . i was so underwhelmed i felt obligated to write this here review , which is also appropriately underwhelming . the best thing about the meal was the iced tea . oh , i guess the service was decent .		1		0
we went here to watch the kansas/north carolina game a few sundays back . everything was okay until it came time to leave . the credit card i 'd given the waiter to start the tab was nowhere in sight , nor was the waiter . he 'd actually slipped out earlier so we 'd had spotty service most of the time we were there , but i just figured it was a shift change . i immediately called my card provider and learned that my card had already been used for a fraudulent transaction . the waiter that had taken over our table let me know that they would be discounting our bill 50 % to account for one of their staff robbing me . i informed him that was unsatisfactory and requested to speak with the manager . someone claiming to be a `` manager '' arrived with a lackadaisical attitude and an unwillingness to actually try and fix the situation . i told her to get the owner . someone claiming to be an `` owner '' also arrived with a lackadaisical attitude , but after raising my voice to him i thought we 'd reached an agreement that nothing would be charged to us . i left without signing any credit card slips and made it explicitly clear to him that any charge from pranksters too was unauthorized . somehow the account for the stolen card posted a charge from pranksters too , however . it goes without saying -lrb- but i 'll say it nonetheless -rrb- that if a patron ca n't trust an establishment at such a fundamental level , the establishment needs to evaluate its own existence . the management and owner clearly need a refresher course on basic customer service skills . on the other hand , though , if they do n't understand that stealing is wrong perhaps going back to preschool would be more appropriate .		1		0
nye , we attended the lustre bar winter wonderland nye party . we could n't get a drink at the bar due to stressed out waitresses and a very crowded bar . so we went downstairs for a drink at 12:30 . we were told that they already had last call and they were ` nt making any more drinks ! seriously , it 's new year 's eve ! plus the staff was rude and ignored people and talked to people they knew . really bad customer service especially if you wanted to impress guests and keep they 're interest . blue hound , you did n't succeed . hope you try better in the future .		1		0
this place is disgusting !! the bun was dry and stale . the veggie burger was yucky ... i do n't think i have ever had one i did n't like before . the kids meals are miniscule . the topping bar is so simple and plain . the dips are not very good ... cheese dip is yuck ! drink choices stink . cookies taste raw and boring . almost forgot to add that the two young kids did n't even care for the french fries because they are seasoned . i thought they were a total waste of calories . i ca n't believe the prices either ... so not cheap or even worth what you pay for .		1		0
this place is definately a dive ! its small , run down , dated , and unclean . ive been twice now , and both times were not by choice . both times , my water glass had nasty stuff on the outside and inside . very disgusting . their tacos are puny , expensive and flavorless . their guacamole just tasted weird almost like there was too much lime juice in it . oh and those pictures that are posted on here are not accurate examples of what you get from lulu 's . everything is tiny and doesnt have much color . this place does not impress me whatsoever and i about cry each time someone suggest that we go : -lrb-		1		0
i had an earlier review of this place 's performance at lunch which had a higher rating . last night , however , took the cake . there was a horrible , really awful , stench out on the back deck of the vig . it smelled like an entire family of rats had died underneath our table . it was the smell of death , or of a really dirty restaurant . it was n't pleasant . unfortunately , it started up as we were halfway into our meal . i know that the patio of the vig is a popular hangout , so i am actually baffled as to what 's wrong with manager pam and others in management who hear about this from customers and yet do n't do anything ? they say `` it 's not our fault . it 's the restaurant next door , with stinky dumpsters . '' as is true in the rest of your life , making excuses does n't help . the only thing that would help is the complete elimination of the odor . others were going inside the restaurant to eat . we stayed and finished our meal -- only later were we surprised no one had offered to move us inside as well . my guess is that if they had , about ten tables would have volunteered to move -- and they could n't fit everyone inside if that was the case . i wrote a note on my check hoping someone would take pity on us and offer a free drink or something for my next visit . but no ... not even a call to management the next day resolved this . `` not our problem '' was the response . unbelievable .		1		0
it saddens me to write such a bad review for one reason - i might be fuego bistro 's biggest fan . so you can imagine how excited i was when i heard they were opening a taco place right around the corner from where i live . sometimes excitement quickly turns to disappointment and sadness , and such is the case with fuego tacos . let 's just go start to finish : - salsa is inedible . way too spicy , and not good spicy , it 's damn take this away spicy - drinks - half the size of the ones at fuego bistro , no good . not enough alcohol and the sangria -lrb- which is top-notch at bistro -rrb- tasted more like red kool aid - food - not so good . i got the veggie tacos , which tasted more like a taco shell filled with sweet -lrb- not good-sweet , bad-sweet -rrb- corn salsa . - service - not too bad , but management response was a turn off . we went in with enamor coupons that clearly stated there were no limits , and they would only let us use one even though we were 2 parties with 2 checks . owner was called on the phone and did n't provide a great response . - atmosphere - would be awesome , but not for this place . more of a trendy could-be club guised as a fancy taco place . please , check out the reviews for fuego bistro and go there . it quite possibly offers the best food , service , and patio dining in phoenix . fuego tacos needs an overhaul , and i can for sure say i wo n't be back .		1		0
james beard would have cut the corn . -- okay so i know you must be wondering exactly what that means . we went to the restaurant on a wed night -- picked up a great rose from az stronghold at public market to avoid the corkage fee and was looking forward to a new dining experience . things started out fabously -- the wait person was well informed and helpful with the menu . we decided to split three dishes . we ordered the scallops appetizer -- they were perfect ! done to perfection which is not easily done with scallops . we split them -- put one on each plate . next came the jerk chicken salad -- again -- a wonderful complement of spicy chicken and mangos -- the perfect marriage of spice and sweet . we commented we had made the perfect choice of the rose from az stronghold and looking forward to the next course . and so it came -- jerk prawns , grilled pineapple on slaw -- with a half an ear of corn -- ahhhhhh there 's the rub . the plate would looked lovely , but because we were sharing -- i asked the wait person -- if the corn could be cut in half -- do n't get me wrong , i really liked my dining companion , but could not just bring myself to nibble on the same ear of corn . the wait person took the plate back to the kitchen -- we were salivating because the prawns smelled really wonderful -- then the plate came back -- and the ear of corn was still in tack -- during the course of rest of the evening we were given several reasons , why this simple request could not be accomodated ahh-the chef is an artist and cutting the corn would have upset the balance of the design of the plate . we could not cut the ear ourselves because there were no sharp knives . -- there are only two chefs and there isn `` t time to accomodate special requests ok -- this is a restaurant with maybe 10 tables -- by the time we left there were only 2 people left in the restaurant . -- so special requests ca n't be accomodated ? also we would have eaten the corn , but instead it was wasted . i am self employed and my customers are everything to my livlihood . if i can accomodate i will even though it might not be exactly what i want to do -- because the more important thing is i want to establish long term relationships with them and have them come back again and again and again . unfortunately -- i will not be going back to breadfruit -- the food was generally good -- but i would rather spend my dining dollar in someplace the recognizes that it is so easy to accomodate simple requests and the benefit to do that is repeat customers . -- it would have been so easy to have satisfied customers , by simply cutting the ear of corn .		1		0
why beat around the bush ? this place sucks . you can tell that someone just bought the building and thought , `` yeah , old florist shop turned overpriced restaurant ... oh , this is awesome !!! '' just because you 've got an antique sign with flashing lights does not mean quality and in this case it certainly does not mean atmosphere . everything is overpriced and ridiculously underwhelming . what were they thinking ? what they were thinking : - `` i 'm gon na open up this really cool restaurant that used to be a flower shop . now what are we going to do about food ? '' - `` well , my son knows how to make stuff ... ' - `` really ? '' - `` yeah , he 's four . '' - `` what can he make ? '' - `` well , he 's really good at rolling these snakes out of play-doh . i do n't know if ... '' - `` stop drilling , you 've hit oil ! we 're buying tables , a mega piano , and we are making this happen ! '' just stay away from this place unless you plan on being adventurous and moving your wine circle/oprah book club meeting outside of scottsdale for a change .		1		0
i wish i could review their food ... but i ca n't . why you ask ? because my party never got seated ! my friend rayna was nice to give this place 2 stars , but i ca n't even do that . i was so disppointed by the whole experience , especially since i was looking forward to my first tapas experience ever . i was over the moon excited , but the service was such a let down , i do n't think i would ever give it a second chance . i am not trying to be ms. whinypants here . i understand the whole sitting with others at the table concept . when my two friends and i showed up for my friend 's birthday party , we were greeted right away . we said that we had a party of 6 and they will be there in less than 5 minutes . the hostess explained that we could sit at the bar and wait , but she could n't seat us until our whole party arrived . she did point out that there was seating for 6 people and she was going to reserve it for us , but she could n't hold it until the whole party arrived . well , while we were waiting , a couple walked in and asked to be seated . there were other places for them to be seated ... but she chose to seat them at our `` reserved '' spot . after that , while we were still standing there , she ignored us . did n't explain to us that she had to seat them there or anything . we were just completely ignored . even when she noticed that another person in our party arrived . an explanation would have been nice . we thought it was unprofessional and lost the customer service appeal altogher . we felt like she chose 2 people or 6 . so we left and decided to have a fantasic experience at barrio cafe ... review coming soon !		1		0
had ridden the light rail one other time before when it had first opened . maybe its because we only took it from one area of asu to mill that it seemed like a pleasant experience and it could have also been because it was new . my friend and i decided to take the light rail again to go to the yelp ultimate science fare at the az science center . we boarded the train at main st. and dobson and got off the train at washington and 3rd . for some reason , it took 25 minutes for us to just get moving from the main street station . then of course the train had multiple stops . keep in mind that we got on the train at main st at 5:45 . we did n't arrive at the az science center till 6:45 . therefore , it took an entire hour to get to the science center when it would have taken about 30 minutes to just drive there from main street and dobson . slllllooooowwwwww . not only that , some of the people on the train were weird and we ended up sitting in front of a bum on the way back . i probably wont ride the train again . not worth it and i dont ' care about the environment . haha		1		0
asked for glazed they are out . so i get apple . walk out and notice they gave bear claw . so i go in as they bring out glazed . really you did n't know the glazed was coming in 60 seconds . and just rude . why be in service business and give customers attitude . i will say the donuts are fresh but i say this all the time if you just do n't care how sanitary is the food your serving .		1		0
umm ... no ... this place is definitely not for us ... i 've read all the positive reviews and was totally excited to try this place today . we 've been craving really good chinese food that would satisfy our spoiled pallet from cali . `` inexpensive , great food , nice service '' ... sounded nice ... first of all , yes the service is really nice . they were very relaxed and ready to serve you . the order took around 15min for a take out which is pretty fast . second , the price ... yes it is on the cheap side but is it really that inexpensive ? for example , compared to phoenix palace , most typical menu items are maybe ~ $ 2.00 or so cheaper ... but if you ask me , you are compromising the quality of the food for that few dollars you are saving . third , the food ... oily ... really ... oily . * chili salt chicken wings = 5 pieces for $ 2.99 . good price , dry , bland , not worth it . * orange chicken = burnt , drowning in dark sauce , could n't tell where the meat was ... * xo sauce beef = ... we found ... 6 pieces of beef slices and the rest was corn starch and onion mush ... with orange colored oil all over . * bean sauce chow fun with squid = this was the only ok dish . tons of squid which was cool , but not much chow fun at all ... and again , oily . overall , we did n't like it . are we gon na go back = no maybe try again someday ? = no * location = good , right across the street from mekong plaza * food = the extra $ 2.00 is so worth it at other restaurants . * service = very nice * decor = very plain		1		0
not the normal type of place i would review , but i came here last night with a few friends to see shutter island . at 9pm at night . on a sunday . the theater was packed but it was opening weekend so that was to be expected . now shutter island is -lrb- supposed to be -rrb- a creepy , scary movie . it has violence and full frontal male nudity . why on earth would people bring their kids to see this ?? that 's right . children . no let me expand on that . babies , toddlers . the kid next to me was maybe five at the oldest . now , i have nothing against kids . i love them , want my own . my issue was really with their parents and theater staff . so kids are crying , talking loudly and the kid next to me threw his booster seat on the ground and was kicking it . it 's noisy . theater staff did nothing explaining that they were children and sometimes children make noise . are you f-ing kidding me ? that response is just unacceptable . i just paid $ 50 to sit in a grown up movie late at night and i want , no , i should be guaranteed the right to enjoy myself for those 2 hours . i know kids make noise . my niece is probably one of the noisiest kids ever and i love her to pieces , but if she 's not behaving and she is interrupting other peoples peaceful enjoyment of whatever it is they 're doing , then i do n't allow that and i will take her outside until she calms down . theater staff needs to realize that a complaint like mine was about noisy kids yes , but ultimately its the parents that need a speaking to .		1		0
after reading all the reviews here about c-fu gourmet being the best place for dim sum in the valley , i am really disappointed to be writing my first 1 star review for the area was the service rude and uncaring ? the answer here is yes . especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you 're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they 're trying to get rid of . but all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good . however the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food . dishes that made me ashamed to be chinese -lrb- yes , the level that c-fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad -rrb- : - fried glutinous rice : the preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was mia . we complained to one of the waiters who replied that `` they probably forgot '' -lrb- um are you sure it 's not cost cutting for those who do n't know any better ? -rrb- . more over , the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you 're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time -lrb- except of course everything is being done in a wok -rrb- ... here the c-fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil . - glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf : once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf . just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf . dishes i was amazed by -lrb- and no not in a good way -rrb- : - deep fried taro dumpling : have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil - steamed bok choy : how the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable ? c-fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable ... unbelievable on a good note , the siu mai was decent . we did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up ... but nope that was it , ... so if you must go to c-fu for dim-sum ... just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes . dinner here was much better . 1 star is for dim-sum only . next time i have a dim-sum craving , you 'll be finding me across the valley at china chan 's -lrb- glendale -rrb- where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who does n't cut corners and it shows . that 's where i 'll be sticking to from now on .		1		0
so 4 of 5 times i 've been completely f ` ed by this damn thing . first i had an appointment and the train was 20mins late to arrive -lrb- and subsequently packed to the gills -rrb- and this was at 1pm in the afternoon ! second time we nearly reached the end of the line and the train locked up the breaks and we sat unmoving for 15mins , with not so much as a peep from the driver . turns out they needed to `` switch the tracks '' to allow for another train to get by our train . the fourth time the train had to stop and wait because they were ahead of schedule -lrb- making us late -rrb- . then last night we were stopped mid route and told that we were waiting to switch drivers -lrb- and she had n't arrived yet , so we just waited for 15mins -rrb- . this is the most undependable mass transit i 've ever used . i was originally sooo excited about this , only to find it managed by chimps . total fail !		1		0
just saw u2 there a few week ago . and although the band was great , u of p as a concert venue stinks for several reasons : - parking and traffic flow . the streets and freeway around the westgate area were not designed to handle the traffic . after finally reaching the stadium , i was sent into one parking lot , only to be sent back out and then to another lot , etc. . this went on for a good 25 minutes . oh , and did i mention they wanted $ 20 to park ? - the sound was awful and my ears will never be the same . now , i know this may or may not be the stadium 's fault , but i know this venue was not designed for perfect concert sound . it was built for football . but i could not understand half of what bono said the sound was so bad . and it was so loud my ears rang for two days . - insane lines for everything . i realize they were near capacity for this event , but lines for the bathrooms , food , booze , everything were ridiculously long . i understand that cards games are much more organized . i may still go to a game someday . however , i will never attend a concert here again .		1		0
update 3/22/12 - judy b. has deleted the review . update 3/19/12 - frenchie b. is user judy b. now . updated 3/16/12 : first i was glad to see the owner private message regarding our experience there , that was nice . but then i noticed the same user end `` frenchie b. '' wrote a review for au petit four too . private message : `` may be you were shocked by the price you paid , let me tell you we did not rise our price from the esplanade . you 2 cakes and 2 creme brulee and they are the most expensive of the 10 items ingredients we use are very expensive and high quality . you should ask the detail bill to pierre there is no reason you did not have it . do not feel ripped off , i feel sorry , because you came over to scottsdale , but i also hope to see you again soon . thank you and have a nice week end . '' part of their review on 3/9/12 states : `` also , if 50 dollars is to expensive for you after having 2 sodas especially the delicious lemonades who are from france so they are more expensive then a can of coke , 2 meals and 2 desserts then mcdonalds is better for you . . price wise of course . '' after review their review , i was shock to see how they think about their customers . how 2 faced can you get . nice in the private message and then blast a customer on a public review . if i would have had 2 drinks , 2 meals , and 2 desserts for $ 50 , that is a great deal . we had 5 non-alcoholic drinks , 4 desserts , and a cookie for $ 48.50 . you know , we should have taken the kids to mcdonalds for dessert . to read the rest of frenchie b.

this place is douchebag central . you go in and iif you are not dressed like a punker then you are ignored or ridiculed from a distance . i heard there is a room in the back for after hours sex acts but that may be a pseudo rumor the same way this is a pseudo place .		1		0
i was so pissed off . i ordered the coronado enchiladas , the special they had last week . they were awful . if i wanted undercooked tortillas with a veggie filling , and taco bell sauce , i could go to taco bell . but nontheless , i paid $ 9 . and they did not replace my crap food for free . i ended up paying $ 17 total for the mongolian ... which is good , but not $ 17 good . make sure that you are going to enjoy what you get , because them not owning up to shitty food is a bad idea .		1		0
my wife and i had a 8 o'clock reservation at zinc . we were ushered to a two top in the traffic pattern , easily the worst table in the room . there were several banquets available and we were told noway , no how we are fully booked . one hour and ten minutes later all these tables were still empty . our waitperson was efficient and officious . we felt like we were more in a diner than a `` fine dining restaurant '' . i had the chicken dish - $ 28.00 for about 6 ounces of chicken , 2 ounces of risotto and about 20 green peas ? draft beers are served about 2/3rd of a glass at $ 7.00 ? there is n't anything about zinc that is french except for the frisee salad and the attitude . $ 140.00 plus . way over rated . one plus , the ambiance is great .		1		0
$ 13 for a bland , large cheesesteak . $ 13 for a bland , large cheesesteak with 5 pieces of mushrooms that we paid extra for . $ 13 for a bland , large cheesesteak that we ordered with fries -- we got about 10 pieces for that $ 3 . absolute and utter rip off . semi-friendly cashier who seemed hell bent on rushing us through our order even though there was no one behind us . n o . n e v e r e v e r again . ever . if i could give this place zero stars and burn it down in the process , i would . it was shiteous . absolutely shiteous . am i making myself clear ? i think i am .		1		0
great place if you have a lot of time to waste ... here 's the breakdown . estimate time in increments of 5 mins about 5 mins to get seated another 5 to get take our drinks 10 mins to get the drinks and order our food 10 mins for the food to arrive * 10 mins into eating ... hmm ... where 's our server ? 10 mins has past , drink cups are empty ... . hmm ... should i get a apb on our server ? 15 mins later ... how was everything ? whoa ! his alive !!! another 5 mins to get the check ... wait my automatic watch stopped working ... . . all in all the food is mediocre but with molasses type service and contraband prices this place to needs to be banned just like their cigars .		1		0
i have been back to this honey bear 's location several times since my first review . and the place has gotten significantly worse on each subsequent visit . this last visit will definitely be my last . the place does not look well maintained at all and the food was an utter disappointment . i ordered my usual hot link sandwich and my other half ordered a pulled pork sandwich . my hot link sandwich was so so sad . and the pulled pork sandwich was not only smaller and on different bread but also lacking taste or flavor , and add to that it not tasty . of course , it gave him heartburn later to his dismay now i need to find myself another place to sate my hot link cravings ! .		1		0
let me share my spinato 's experience with you . i have had their pizza a few times , but the last time was the last . and i mean it . the last experience was with their food i ordered `` traditional vegetarian '' , with added pepperoncini . got home , no pepperoncini . oh well , no big deal . started eating it and discovered a strange flavor . kinda like dog treats . went to kitchen to inspect pizza . well , low and behold , under the inch or so of cheez -lrb- i do n't think its real cheese -rrb- was pepperoni on the `` traditional vegetarian '' . uhm ok ?! verified the receipt and it was entered correctly ! this household does n't eat animals . i 'm sorry , between the overly sweetened sauce , too much cheese , undercooked crust and the mixup i will never again waste my money here . please , if you want pizza , do not come here .		1		0

wow , now you guys rename a new page the w scottsdale and call this one something different to hide your bad ratings ... shady ... my og review was for the scottsdale w and now it is for `` the living room '' and i see a scottsdale w related ? hmm weird ... shady , shady , shady ... and guess what , this w -lrb- not all -rrb- still sucks major donkey balls ... i am also going to repost this review on both pages as it is for the hotel itself -lrb- and yes i have stayed there -rrb- original review : `` this w sucks ... so smug and unpleasant , whether its the annoying people , the overpriced everything , or the horrible staff , this place blows hard . i have been to w 's in sf/hollywood/ny and they all actually are pretty cool and i have enjoyed them . you can totally tell that persians run this joint , do n't get me wrong , i love persian people , but there is that certain breed of them that wear douchey designer glasses and are obsessed with shiny jewlery and their 3-series and treat people like shit . that is the vibe this place puts off , like a sleezy wan na be vegas spot that is so far from cool that it is laughable . do n't even waste your time , but if you do make sure to pre-game because that shit is expensive !

in short : awful food with no imagination , go at your own peril . i was in downtown phoenix and it was pretty late so decided to drop by this place . looked ok from the outside but i should have walked out as soon as i walked in . the place was adorned by eclectic collection of 60 's , 70 's and 80 's lefotovers . the atmosphere from the start was dead wrong . hardly any of the staff spoke english , which made ordering an interesting adventure in it self . the menu is also a collection of 60 's , 70 's and 80 's leftovers ans typical chinese dishes . which in my opinion is ok if the food was any good , unfortunately that was not the case . we ordered a soup , a appetizer , and two main dishes -lrb- kung pao chicken , and spicy beef -rrb- . soup was decent but the appetizer was over cooked and soaked with oil , then plastered with a thick sauce to make up for it . spicy beef was overcooked and unappetizing as well , i suspected the meat was a little old as well . the real kicker was the cungpao chicken , my friend noticed a piece of rotten vegetable on our dish . we brought this to the attention of our waitress who took the dish to show to another staff member and then came back and said there was nothing wrong with it and it was a water chestnut . she took over 10 minues to explain this but for the life of me i could n't understand her . they really did n't give us an option to replace the dish , get a new one or even refund the money . i have no idea if it was a rotten or actually a chestnut but they could have at least offered us a compromise . customer service was pretty much zero . i eat a lot of chinese food and i was really disappointed with the oldest chinese restaurant in phoenix .		1		0
did i really just pay twenty eight bucks for two small plates of lettuce and two small sodas ? yes i did . and i feel mighty ashamed . throw in terrible , bleak , sick looking decorations while i eat my thirteen dollar salad and i feel even worse . and add another two dollars if you want chicken on that already pricey salad . i do n't know , maybe if you 're a slob who takes a dozen trips to the buffet it could be worth it , but i just wanted a salad . i am not a fan .		1		0
the service at this restaurant is horrible . my friend and i had wanted to go to the phoenician lobby for burgers , but they were going to close , so we went here . basically , delux is one of those places that charges you phoenician-like rates and puts on the same kind of politically correct show with the fancy-pants decor , but the service is at the same level as mcdonald 's . first of all , the service is slow . and the waiter was moderately unpleasant from the beginning . and they sat us at a tiny table for 2 . so far , no big deal . but then the impatient staff comes over and kept trying to take away our dishes . `` are you finished with that plate ? '' , the waiter asked , when i was only half finished with the burger . eventually , they swooped in and took the plate out without asking . they also took other stuff of mine and threw it away . the manager is some girl barely out of high school with a sassy attitude , and even before i explained my situation , you could tell she could care less . -lrb- she eventually found some of my stuff , then lied and said it had n't been in the garbage . -rrb- then , when the server sees me leaving no tip , he starts swearing at me , and when we leave , he makes a point to open the door and say `` thanks for nothing '' . little did he realize that since i put the meal on my credit card , my friend left the tip in cash . a 22 % tip . so much for service . we could have gone to the phoenician and they would have blown us kisses even if we did n't tip . and if they would have taken my stuff and thrown it away without asking , they probably would have given me a free room . that 's the difference between real class and service , and fakers like the kind who work at delux . i am never going back ever again , and i 'm sure until the doors close , no one at delux will care about my return , or that of anyone else 's . customers seem to be the impediment to their running what would otherwise be , in their opinion , a great restaurant .		1		0
so i 've eaten at this restaurant before . however , the other night we had a guest in from out of town and an event earlier in the evening . so we booked a reservation at this restaurant , which they confirmed . when we walked into the restruant the place was n't very busy and the greeter informed us that our reservation was n't going to be honored , but , we were welcome to order a drink at the bar . because it was already after 9 at that point we had a difficult time finding a place that could accommodate us on such short notice . interestingly we did n't even have the latest reserved seating they were offering , there was one or two even later . i eat out and entertain a lot for business and personal . i rarely write totally negative reviews . but , not honoring a reservation that a restaurant has not only taken but , have confirmed just because the staff is lazy and wants to go home is completely unacceptable and shows a general lack of customer service and care for the client . i do agree with an earlier reviewer . . if you want seafood go to mccormicks and schmicks or for a more local flare , the salt cellar .		1		0
cash only -lrb- $ 1.50 atm fee -rrb- . chain concept from vietnam . `` mass-produced '' baguettes ready `` every 30 minutes '' are not worth the trip . $ 2.25 10 '' bologna salami and vietnamese veggies . what do you expect for $ 2.25 ?! great value ... but i was hoping for better . -- rancid pickle -- rancid red onion -- american cheese : think `` cheap brand that wishes it were kraft singles '' -- yeah , it was bad -- no oil in the house , no vinegar in the house . only mayo and mustard in the 0.02 oz packet . lots of choices here ... ice cream , wings , sandwiches ... cheap , generic , flavored coffee syrups displayed like precious alcohol ... whaat !?? maybe it 's a cultural thing . but all i wanted was a good baguette sandwich . what a shame ! pass !		1		0

my girlfriend and i have tried luci 's many times . like dozens , because we live close by and it would be so cool to have this place be good . if you like good coffee skip it . a couple of time they sold us regular coffees and were actually out and we had to wait for them to brew more . one time we tried the baked goods and they tasted like they were sitting in that case for weeks ! so nasty . most recently we tried the breakfast we tried the buckwheat pancakes and were charged a dollar for 4 extra blueberries . i tried a cappuccino and the foam was so thick i had to scope it out into the garbage can . the first 4 times we went the staff was rude , un-attentive and very unorganized . the staff seemed to be nicer this time but still unorganized . in the end , too expensive for such a sub par experience . too bad so sad .		1		0

i have visited here for lunch on a sat afternoon . after waiting for a very long time , having to ask if we have a server , a kid came up who , i hope , was on his first day . we ordered drinks and lunch . caeser salad , dressing on side . add chicken . i ordered coffee and chicken kabob things . dressing came on salad , allergy !!! chicken things came deep friend and gross . plus there was a hair in the salad . we had high hopes for this great sounding spot with such a good location . we were very much let down . we have tried to try a different spot in scottsdale alomost every weekend we are in town and can not say a bad thing about any except this one . very disappointing . having read another review i may steer clear of fusion .		1		0
this has to be the worst restaurant in terms of hygiene . two of my friends had food - poisoning after having dinner here . the food is just unhealthy with tons of oil floating on the top of curries , and i am not sure if any health/hygiene code is followed here . the service is poor and the information on its website is incorrect , the owner does not allow dine-in after 9 or 10 even though it says that the restaurant is open till 11 . one night i saw the owner cleaning the place without gloves and she was nice enough to give us a to-go parcel without cleaning her hands -lrb- great example to the servers ! -rrb- . i had a peek inside the kitchen when the door was ajar , and it definitely looked dirty . i have been a lot of hole-in-the-wall places around this restaurant , including haji baba , the vietnamese place and others , but neither any of my friends nor i have fallen sick coz of the food . if you need a spicy-food fix , i strongly recommend you do not try this place , lest you want a visit to the doctor the very next day .		1		0
hey southwest : it 's no surprise why people whisper behind your back , calling you `` southworst . '' it 's no surprise why , when asked , your unfortunate patrons say they feel miserable whenever they fly on your airline . it 's true . you make people miserable - with your strange and stupid delays , your cattle-call boarding , your small seats with no leg room and your rude , obnoxious employees . to your surprise , it does , indeed , sometimes rain in phoenix -lrb- and even las vegas , for that matter -rrb- . sometimes with rain , comes fog and low visibility . i think you should have learned that in 3rd grade science . in any case , whenever it rains , you , southworst , forget flying fundamentals - perhaps like an actor with stage fright - and simply refuse to perform . it 's true ; you make people miserable . you make them wait in other cramped airports for four to six hours -lrb- maybe longer -rrb- , just hoping to soon be boarding , just hoping there 's not an excruciating wait on the tar mat or that their checked bag -lrb- s -rrb- wo n't end up in bangladesh . they say misery likes company . i believe you hate yourself , southworst . i would , too , if i were you . so , in hating yourself , you hate others . you bully them , take their money , make them wait , cackle when you know they 're hungry , tired and in need of some deodorant and a breath mint . you 're miserable , southworst , and you make me miserable , too . disregards , alicia		1		0
alright , this is the last time i am gon na give this place a chance . i have attempted to try every type of food they have here to see exactly what the hype is all about and why oregano 's is always at least a 30 min wait to be seated . this last time i went , i vowed to order one of the salads and their traditional pepperoni pizza because these are the items i have heard so much about from other people . i tasted some of the picasso salad and a regular garden salad . yes both were large , but all that came to mind while eating them was `` meh . '' the ranch dressing that came with my garden salad tasted straight out of the bottle and the picasso salad was nothing impressive . i swear there was more tortilla strips in that salad then lettuce . do n't get me wrong , i love tortilla strips , but they are supposed to accent the salad , not act as the entire salad ! now on to the pizza ... i had tried their picasso pizza before and was not impressed . i figured i ordered wrong so i decided to get a simple slice of pepperoni pizza this time around . nothing impressive to be honest . too much cheese that was melted but not gooey almost like it had been sitting , the marinara sauce was nothing special and it really did n't have any flavor , and the thin crust was almost non existent . it tasted like i was eating just a big blob of cheese ! plus , there was a small hair on it . oh and i did n't even mention that for 2 salads , and 2 lunch special pizza slices , we waited about 45 minutes ? i just do n't get what the hype is about with this place . maybe people in az do n't know good pizza ? if ya want good pizza , head to nello 's or sal 's gilbert pizza . skip oregano 's . unless your taste-buds are severely lacking , you are in for a letdown .		1		0

how does this place have an average of 3 stars ??? i am giving one star because there 's no way to go any lower ! eeek ! i have lived in phx for more or less 25 years . it 's been at least 22 since i 've been into a big apple and now i remember why . there was a large group of us - and we came in at staggered times . i know this is a hassle for the server - as she got the orders technically correct and all the seperate checks were accurate , i will say our server , juanita , was completely acceptable . i would say i prefer my servers to have all their key teeth - but that 's just snobby and irrelevant to the service , so i 'll let it go . food - the value here would be great for a steakhouse - if it was good . the zucchini app for the table was a-ok . it 's a mountain of sliced breaded and fried zuc - and it was fried right and served piping hot . the salad dressings threw me off a bit . no regular italian or balsamic vinaigrette - but a raspberry vinaigrette ? at a value steakhouse ? the french dressing is a cinnamon french . not bad ... but i 'm not a fan of dessert flavored iceberg lettuce . : -rrb- for entree , i chose the ribeye with baked potato . the potato was fine . i wish i could say the same about the meat - but i still ca n't figure out how they managed to make a rib eye tasteless . it was on the rare side of the medium rare i ordered - and with that much fat , it should have been delicious . but , no . not a morsel of flavor to be found in the whole 12oz serving . -lrb- half was consumed for next day lunch - the extra aging did n't help . : -rrb- in fact - my dog was n't even impressed . -rrb- nothing wrong with the corn on the cob - as long as it 's cooked i think that 's hard to mess up . i am guessing the baked beans were ok - some people must like the cloyingly sweet 3 parts brown sugar to 1 part bean recipe . personally , i am not a fan , so i did n't enjoy them . the decor is cowboy steakhouse . very similar to any other cowboy steakhouse . -lrb- lonestar , texaz roadhouse , etc. -rrb- but - that brings us to the restroom . parents - shield your children ! nature called , so i went to check out the restrooms . i understand sometimes old plumbing allows odors to linger that newer buildings do n't have issues with . as i walked the hall toward the restroom doors , the outhouse smell grew with each step . once in the ladies ' room , the smell was almost noxious . i know it 's clean and germ free in there - as the smell of bleach competed with the sewage smell . as i became nauseated , i pondered if i 'd be able to hold my breath until i was finished , put back together and hand washed . i even considered skipping washing my hands , as we did have wet naps on the table . anything to get out of there faster ! -lrb- i did wash my hands , but did n't take time to dry them , and re-zipped and buttoned my jeans as i was walkling back the outhouse stinking hallway back to the dining room . -rrb- i 've heard it mentioned that everyone has thier own personal hell - not necessarily the fire and brimstone depictions . if this is true , i will do my best to be a good girl the rest of my life - i am afraid this place with it 's stink restrooms , tasteless meat and strange `` mordern '' salad dressings -lrb- strange for an old fashioned cowboy steakshouse , anyway -rrb- may very well be the hell i 'd be sent to if my good deeds did n't add up at final judgement .		1		0
i have never been treated so rudely , by a fellow group of native americans . makes me regret the time and effort i spent trying to help these greedy tribes gain this power , that they now so blatantly abuse . it also makes me rethink the whole legality of it . these apples have red skin , but a white core .		1		0
omg ! sushi left on the counter for 30 minutes , then served to us as though it was just made freshly ? i think not ! the sea eel did n't even look suitable for a photograph , but not wanting to be fussy , i tried it , and quickly spit it out ! this place is more of a 1 time visit . i 've been several times , and still am not impressed . that was the last try , i hope to never be starved for sushi and stuck by that place again . the service sucks at the bar , it was the bartender who served up the sour sushi too ! steer clear from here , you 've neen yelped ! oh and the big fish tank in the floor ? its not all that . although the decor keeps bringing me back-it makes me forget all the previous visits-then i quickly remember when i 'm waiting for the sushi . one things fer sure , if ur looking for all those candy pushers , with the burned out ed hardy clothes , plastic booby flashing bleached blondes or euro-transplants looking to do anyone that will get them somewhere , well there you go ... because its all there .		1		0
i really hated this place . granted , i am not a fan of mexican food , but i know good mexican food when i taste it , and i know bad mexican food when i taste it . i will tell you that this place is getting one star solely on the absolutely terrible food i had and the awful service . first of all , our server was hardly ever present . i found this strange considering our group of 4 was only 1 of 3 or 4 tables in the whole place . we ordered an appetizer along with our drinks , specifically requesting for the app to come out before the entrees . this did n't happen . in fact , our entrees were served and we never received our app . after we pointed that out to our waiter who decided to stop by after we were about 3/4 done with our food , the waiter asked if we would like for him to get it now . um , no . we 're done now . ugh as for the food , it was far below mediocre . i got the beef flautas and they were awful . the meat was as dry as can be and had absolutely no seasoning . none ! the shells were somehow soggy and flavorless . boo . i order one of the easiest things to make on the menu , besides a quesadilla , and i get the worst possible experience . what a shame . everyone else did n't seem too thrilled about their food either . i hate this place . i will never be back . it 's hard to get people to come back when the whole restaurant smells like a port-a-potty . i can excuse the filth , because honestly , does n't good mexican food come from a dirty kitchen ? see ya mi patio , i 'm heading over to filli b 's .		1		0
so i have eaten here at least 10 times , usually love it . however , went there last week and ordered the santa fe eggs benedict , which is usually my fav , when i am eating carbs . i could not believe this was the meal i was wasting my valuable calorie intake on ! the sauce literally tasted like paste -- flour and water . when i told the manager/owner/whatever , he said , `` you should have told me . '' i am thinking , `` i am telling you ! '' did n't offer a discount , cup of coffee , kind word . i think he said he was sorry , which did not solve the problem of the gross meal i had just consumed . my hubby said his pancakes were average . has the reputation of this place gone to their heads ? i hope not . owning a home in north phoenix , i enjoy the prospect of sunnyslope as the new `` it '' place to be .		1		0
this is thee local spot for mid sized nationally touring acts ! it 's clean -lrb- a rarity in it 's genre -rrb- and the sound and sight lines are great . it 's an old theater with the seats taken out so you can get as close as you want -lrb- always general admission -rrb- . as of late they have been insanely anal about security at the door -lrb- you must take off your shoes !?!? -rrb- but other than that it 's by far the best place to see a band in phoenix ! they now are charging $ 5 for parking -lrb- and have taken over public parking areas -rrb- ... now for big shows you have to walk a mile across the bridge to get in ... it really is a pain in the ass -lrb- combined with the door screening -rrb- ... so i 'm downgrading this venue from a 5 star ... although they must know the set time -lrb- it 's in the contracts -rrb- ... they refuse to tell you them ... in hopes that you spend more time here waiting and drinking -lrb- i.e. more money from their captive audience . total assholes to their own customers ... now i 've downgraded to a one star !		1		0
tsoynamis are one of my favorite foods in the world . i 'm lactose intolerant and love blizzards , so it 's a match made in heaven . i go to green a lot as i live nearby , and have never felt unwelcome there , so i had no reason to think i 'd feel that way about their sister joint , nami . so after a disappointing dinner at nobou at teeter house in downtown phx , bf and i were excited to turn our night around with dessert at nami when we realized we were super close to it and it was still open -lrb- since green would have been closed by the time we got there -rrb- . their hours posted indicate they close at 9:30 pm on fridays , and we arrived at 9:20 after calling to confirm they were still open . we walked in , and there were a few groups of people sitting and leisurely enjoying their ice cream and baked goods . we walked up to the counter and bf knew what he wanted right away -lrb- s'mores tsoynami with pb added ... so good ! -rrb- . i , on the other hand , needed a minute to decide since they had a huge bakery case filled with things i never see at green and wanted to try out , in addition to the full tsoynami menu . i asked a few questions , which the light-haired woman working there was happy to answer . she disappeared to make bf 's tsoynami , though , and we were then met with an icy stare and complete annoyance by the dark-haired woman working there . i like to give people the benefit of the doubt , and hey , it 's friday night and she probably wanted to close up so she could go out . but it was n't even 9:30 , and she had zero interest in making this customer happy . i said i was debating between a cookie and a tsoynami , while she rolled her eyes and continued to tap her fingers on the counter . her response , rather than a suggestion or recommendation for something to order , was , `` we close in five minutes . '' ok ? i know that already ? why would n't you just try to hurry us along in a constructive way , rather than making me feel afraid to ask you any questions about your products ? she continued to sigh and look around , willing us to disappear , and honestly i wish we would have left right then . but we were starving , and i really wanted to enjoy one of their delicious looking treats . i decided in my head that i wanted a tsoynami , but i was way too afraid to have that lady actually prepare something for me as i was pretty sure she would spit in it , in addition to the length of time it would have taken to prepare which surely would have put us over her 5-minute limit . i said i 'd take the cookie , to get us out of there sooner . we still had to wait another minute for bf 's tsoynami to be finished , and felt her stare us down the whole time . mind you , there are still parties of other customers at tables still lingering . we were definitely not responsible for keeping them open , but we sure were made to feel that way ! i do n't care how tasty your treats are , i would never ever go back there ... who wants to leave a dessert place with such a sour taste in their mouth ? i will be getting all of my future tsoynamis at green , where they never make me feel like i 'm doing something wrong by asking questions or spending a minute debating between a few items .		1		0
i tried to give it zero ... the funny thing is , we tried three times to go here but the wait was too long so we went elsewhere . claim jumper is right next door . i suggest you jump over to there and save yourself . i wish i had . finally got two seats at the bar on the fourth try . because i do n't eat seafood , i was spared what was to come -lrb- spoiler alert -rrb- . so i get $ 11 chicken fingers , so dry and bad i just drank my beer . which was fine . my copilot ordered the kj -lrb- kendall jackson -rrb- steampot . looked pretty neato with all its netting in there . had mussels and some crab legs . well , the seafood was n't really that steaming and the corn was funny-tasting . my copilot ate the small amount of food -lrb- $ 25 + -rrb- and we were on our way to a much-desired movie right after . but that was not to be ... because lurking in the `` not hot enough steampot was some badddd germ that attacked during the movie and my copilot spent the final hour of the movie worshipping the porcelain god at the arizona mills movie theater . and that is not fun . for anyone . after several stops by the side of the road on the way home , we were kind enough to call joe 's and alert them of the possible threat to all of you , the future diners of joe 's . the response ? `` i ca n't help you . let me take your number and the general manager will call you tomorrow '' . well , after the level of illness , she retired for the evening . next day , no call . third day , we called them and were referred to the main offices in houston . she spoke to them and was asked `` did you eat an unopened mussel ? that can make you sick . '' i wo n't go on any further , but not only were they unapologetic , but they finally offered her a small gift certificate to the same restaurant . seriously . . so i called the health department and needless to say , this was not the first call . so , my advice is : if you go to joe 's , buy a cool tee shirt and watch them dance to cotton eyed joe . they are the only safe activities there . seafood in the desert is risky anyhow . go to ca or me for that . have some ribs instead ...		1		0
if you 're in search of food , keep driving . if you 're in search of pie , drive to the pie hole in phoenix . i used to go to rock springs cafe on a monthly basis with my grandparents when i was younger . that was our thing - taking a sunday drive and stopping by rsc on our way back home to grab food and a piece of `` penny 's pies '' . penny was the gal that used to make all the pies in black canyon city . i learned while we were waiting for our table that there are new owners , and oh my how things have changed . from the appearance and layout to more importantly - the quality of the food . keep on drivin ' if you 're hungry and in this neck of the woods . j , baby c , and i stopped by rock springs to get an early supper on sunday after a day trip up north . i told him about how good the pies were and the food was in general . he was on board when it came time to figure out what we were doing for supper . j ordered the meatloaf dinner and i ordered the chicken . our plan was to feed baby c off of both our plates . good idea in theory . when we ordered , i stated i wanted a baked potato -lrb- which was on the menu -rrb- and the gal said that they do n't serve baked potatoes until after 5pm . ummm ... its sunday and a holiday weekend . if one was going to sell a baked potato , 4pm on a sunday would be the right time . no where on the menu did it state that baked potatoes were n't available until after 5pm . j gets the soup -lrb- chowder -rrb- and i get a side salad . you really cant screw up either of those . j said his soup was pretty good . our dinner comes out a few minutes later . we were shocked to say the least . we both dig in and j immediately is repulsed . his meatloaf was lukewarm , greasy , and the gravy on top was congealed . gag . my chicken was more like a cornish game hen . see photo for the worlds smallest chicken leg . it looked more like a drumette , you know , the kind you 'd get with an order of chicken wings . the vegetables that came with out dinners , a half ear of waterlogged field corn . an ear of corn -lrb- a bad ear at that -rrb- hardly constitutes as `` vegetables '' . i was thinking we 'd get green beans , peas , carrots , or something . the waitress came by and saw j was not pleased . so she took his plate and asked if he wanted anything else . i told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piece of pie . if he was hungry , we could get him something at the outlets in anthem -lrb- which was where we were stopping by on our way home -rrb- . j liked this idea and ordered a slice of banana cream pie . when the pie came out , he took a few bites and that was it . he said it tasted like imitation banana and was not cold , but slightly warm . i seriously doubt this was a true `` penny 's pie '' . more like a bad knockoff . the only positive thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill , without us having to ask or talk to a manager . we stopped by the general store , but the guy there did n't seem interested in helping us . or at least helping me . but yet he yacked it up with j for a minute . when i walked over to the counter to try a sample he was pushing j , did he acknowledge me ? nope . so we left . and we wont be returning . if we 're out for a drive , and are in need of food ... we 'll drive to anthem . and - if you really want a good -lrb- more like awesome -rrb- piece of homemade pie , go to the pie hole in phoenix . : -rrb-		1		0
if the lodge did n't over charge my card 3 visits in a row , i would recommend this place . instead i have to expose them for the repeated credit card errors they have made ! maybe this will force them to hire some honest servers , but probably not ! this has also happened to two of my other friend several times as well ... very disappointing . this past saturday , we went to the lodge at about midnight for some late night snacks we ordered $ 30 worth of food and drinks . my friend and i split the bill -lrb- so about $ 20 each after tip -rrb- . she messaged me today to see if i was billed for the meal , because her card was charged $ 30 . i checked my account and they charged me $ 40 , and these were posted charges , not pending !! this has happened too many times and every time i have to call several times to dispute it , and a manage never happens to be around . at this point i 'm convinced that their servers do this intentionally in hopes that people will be too drunk to remember what they did or leave their receipts behind , so they ca n't dispute it . well i definitely was not drunk and i know i was ripped off . you have lost a customer because of your bad business practices and dishonest servers .		1		0

wow , this place is just not good . went there for lunch and first off the chips and salsa were terrible . the salsa tasted worse than pace from a grocery store jar . then came my `` taco salad '' . i asked if instead of meat i could have refried beans . okay , so my $ 13 `` taco salad '' consisted of a shell with iceburg lettuce and a ladel full of refried beans on the top . that 's it . yeah . that 's it . oh , i did get some sour cream and guac on the side of the plate , but no tomtatoes in the salad , not even a little onion or garnish or anything . just iceberg lettuce and refried beans poured on top . it was gross !! and it was $ 13 dollars !! give me a break . my husband ordered a black bean chimichanga . the beans were soggy and refried style black beans , no flavor or spice , totally boring . the food was seriously terrible and ridiculously expensive . we spent over $ 30 on that crappy crap of a terrible lunch and will never go back there .		1		0

my goal on saturday night was to stay home and just relax . i should have listened to that goal . i have been to the parlor many times in the past year and always enjoy my food and service . i have to say that my one experience there that i had saturday night will guarantee that i never step foot in this place ever again . this is n't something about it being an off night ... management proved that they just do not care about their guests . around 6 o'clock through twitter the specials came through for the night . they had listed a prime sirloin with a pesto spread and potatoes and broccolini . since my friend jill and i end up sharing almost the same brain , she texted me immediately that we should go there and try it out . i was game . i even called over to the parlor to ask about the special and if there was a wait . 15 minutes later , at 7 o'clock , jill and her boyfriend tony show up and put their names on the waiting list . about 10 minutes after i showed up we were seated . we sat down and immediately told the server that we wanted 3 specials . tony , the server -lrb- not be confused with bf tony -rrb- regrettably told us that they were out of the special after i ordered an iced tea . since jill has gluten and dairy allergies , there was n't anything else she could eat there . we asked to speak with the manager before we would make up our minds to just leave . server tony asked me if he should hold off on the tea and i told him yes . -lrb- the iced tea is important to this event -rrb- the manager -lrb- who i believe her name was monica ... not 100 % sure -rrb- came up and acted very defensively about running out of the special ... even before we had the opportunity to explain our situation . jill said that i even called before to make sure about the special and there was n't anything else she could eat . manager excused herself , came back , and stated that they could use a flank steak instead . we asked what the price would be for that and she said the same price . for a flank steak ? that is n't even close to the quality of a prime sirloin ! manager monica -lrb- ? -rrb- said that she would comp us either drinks or dessert . we decided to stay ... silly people we were . server tony came back , with my iced tea ... though i never told him that i wanted it again . he asked if everything was taken care of . we said yes and that the manager said that she would comp drinks ... so we all ordered glasses of wine . tony leaves and then comes back to tell us that manager monica told him that she would comp us desserts and $ 2 off our entree . since jill ca n't eat the dessert and that was n't what was discussed , we asked for the manager again . enter eric . i have to say that i never met a bigger jackass in my life . he comes up to us and says `` my name is eric and the parlor is considered my place . as we make specials , you have to understand that it is n't an exact science . sometimes we run out of things . '' fine we get that . i told him that the not having a special is now a moot point since his manager offered us something that she is now reneging on . he faces me and says `` have you ever worked in a high stressed environment before ? sometimes we say things that we just think about then . '' i told him that `` yes i have worked in a high volume stressed workplace before and as a manager i honor what comes out of my mouth . '' i am sorry , but if you ca n't trust your manager with making decisions in a `` high stressed '' environment then you need to rethink your staff . he then back pedaled and said that he would comp the whole bill for us if that is what we wanted . we told him we were n't looking for a free meal , but ok . food came and he left . well , of course , the flank steak -lrb- cooked medium rare -rrb- what not up to par and very tough . the broccolini had absolutely no flavor . the potatoes were great though . of course this is n't the end of the story . the bill came and i am not shitting you ... the only thing on the bill was my iced tea . after all of that , you could n't comp my iced tea along with everything else ? we should have left then , because a few minutes later the server came back and told us that he handed us the wrong bill . the correct bill was drinks comped , 3 entrees for $ 12 and still my iced tea . -lrb- yes this is a big deal to me -rrb- we could n't believe it . if a restaurant is not prepared for a special for saturday night -lrb- a high volume day -rrb- then you should n't even offer a special . as a friend said to me today , this is a pizza joint and they should just stick to pizza and not offer these other specials just to get us in . customer service comes a long way especially in our economy . i will be willing to pay for good food and good service . the parlor proved that they have neither .		1		0
i 've been a customer of blanco 's for quite a while now . it 's a go-to place for girl 's night or a quick bite with my hubby . unfortunately , blanco has lost both my husband and i as patrons . on a recent saturday night , we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria . after we had learned our lesson on weekends past , my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes . no big deal and nothing we did n't expect . an hour after our call in time , and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes , i approached the hostess asking where we were on the list . she informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table . half an hour after that , no table . i politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped , marked off the list and forgotten . the hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes . when i went to sit back down , the couple sitting next to us were seated . infuriated , we both decided it was time to leave . my husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights . they said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right . i find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable . we were patient , understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant . in return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table . on the plus side , we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now . thanks for the help , blanco !		1		0

i decided to give mojo yogurt another try . i 've never been a fan of mojo , and last night cemented my displeasure . we walked in around 10:30 pm on a saturday and found three young employees screwing around . i was a teenager once -lrb- i suppose we all were ... -rrb- , but even then i knew what constituted `` professional '' behavior . i was in a good mood , so i was willing to overlook this ... but at this time , they just happened to be emptying out the trays that catch the melted yogurt . never in my life have i been more disgusted . even the three girls were grossed out as they poured the brown , chunky liquid into the trash cans . there was melted refuse on the floor and splashed on the machines . their explanation ? `` it 's that time of the night ! '' i tried to look away but i could n't seem to get the image out of my mind . i had a sample or two but my stomach started to rumble . i looked over to the toppings bar and realized that i did n't trust what they were serving . if the health department walked in this place , it would have been shut down immediately . the yogurt machines do not have any special plastic tips to make the yogurt flow out in a three-dimensional star pattern ; the yogurt comes out of the machine in a cylindrical shape -- strikingly similar to a solid turd . sucks to be a chocolate fan ! i looked at my friend and we silently eyed the door ; i could n't bring myself to purchase food from such an unkempt establishment . we quickly hurried out and headed to yogurtland back in scottsdale . thank goodness there are a plethora of reputable , clean yogurt shops elsewhere !		1		0

this could be the worst whole foods in the valley . the cold case is way smaller than most other places and they do n't have all the usual salads available , including the one i came looking for which was the tailgate coleslaw . no bbq area , no pre-cooked meals to go or salads to go either . the smoothie place on site uses frozen fruit , not fresh fruit as well . i have come across these versions of whole foods before and not sure why they do n't renovate the older stores or move to larger location . every one should be the same with the same choices . will find another .		1		0
gon na keep this simple ... i was excited to try what i heard was a local dining institution on a blistering summer day . a nice , big , cold beer , award winning food , and cheery , delightful service . ya , right . naked chicken wings with the extra hot sauce as i had requested were as tepid as the sauce , on the side and not dressed , was insipid . frank 's red hot with some butter and probably a sprinkle of cayenne , and a heavy handed addition of `` grossness '' were the worst i 've had in recent memory . my favorite bbq item is burnt ends . lovingly smoked twice and over seasoned and carcinogenic in the best way possible . dillons ' interpretation is rather unique : boil some pork , cut in cubes , dump on dirty plate and smother in brown gravy infested with cornnstarch and liquid smoke . worst i 've had in recent memory . oh , and that big ol' cold beer i was anxiously desiring ... a 12 oz glass with two times more fingerprints on it than beer in ounces . i counted twelve separate greasy paw prints . do the math and you 'll figure out the ratio . worse ratio of prints to ounces i 've had in recent memory . service is n't worth mentioning . but worst in recent memory . seems to be a trend here .		1		0
arrogance or ignorance ? i do n't know and i do n't care . dec 7th , i got home and considered my options . a stuffed pizza from oregano 's , god , that sounded so good . i called at 8:13 pm and ordered the pizza . `` you know this pizza takes like an hour '' the super-happy server asked . `` yes i do '' , i said . at 9:00 , i left my place at 20th st. and missouri avenue . 7th street was closed . ?!!! central avenue : closed . 7th avenue , closed . a parade ... oreganos : thank you for calling oreganos ! me : hey , that pizza for teddy ? wo n't be able to pick it up ... oreganos : why is that ? me : because all the streets that lead to your restaurant are closed !!!!!!!!!! why would n't you tell me that ? oreganos : oh ... i thought that parade would be over by now . -lrb- laughing -rrb- i could ` run it out to you ' ... oh , just kidding ! literally , while hungry , an entire 90 minutes of my life i 'll never get back . oreganos did n't know or did n't care ... that the parade of lights parade all but closed access to their restaurant . fool me over and over again . all for the love of a stuffed pizza . hey ! oreganos ! i 'll come back , at some point . but my point now is , it 'll be 6 months-year from now , instead of one/week . any kind of customer service , `` gee , sir , i 'd love to get you that pizza but you 'll have difficulty getting in here until 9:45 '' , that kind of customer service . so , i could not go south but i could go north . i ate a delicious pizza from the new rosatti 's on 16th and missouri . fabulous !		1		0

my office is now with in walking distance , but we have been going here since it was dee 's . we being a couple of guys and i . so today bruce said ; lets go to lunch , i say , ok . he then says ; i know anywhere except 5th ave. the boy knows me so well ;-[ -rrb- i tell him no i will go today , it has been a while since i have given in and gone with the masses . i just do not like the place . so we walk over and are greeted by a bubbly waitress . this place always has nice wait people . she talks with us for a few minutes and then takes our order . oh the food , the food . i order a french dip with cole slaw and a side of onion rings . bruce has his usual a blt with well done bacon and fries . now mind you we are the only folks ordering at the time and still it takes an unusual amount of time to get the food . which by the way would have been better if we had never gotten our food . what i get is roast beef cut thickly and with the grain . now anyone who likes a french dip knows the meat should be supple and sliced thinly , piled nicely on the bun . it should also have a rich beef flavour as should the au jus . i mean even the lowly of the low line cook should know one slices meat against the grain , always . the bun on which it sat was just that , a meat seat . i also love cole slaw and usually will eat what is served , not this . totally lacking any inspiration resulting in no flavour . the rings looked good , but looks can be deceiving . so bruce you are right , any place but 5th ave.		1		0
this place had me confused from the get go . first off , no parking except for valet , which even though is free you still always tip so it 's not free . is this phoenix az or los angeles ca ? the neighbors around this place must be pissed , if you do n't use valet you have to park in front of their houses . the valet lot is tiny so they run out of room very quickly . second , is this a nice restaurant , a sports bar , or a playground for children ? i was greeted with a line of about 20 people before we could even speak to a hostess so we just walked into the bar/playground area on our own . after wandering around looking for a seat a little tabled opened up and we took it . uncomfortable little metal stools and a rickety wood top was what we had to deal with . there was no wait staff coming around to any of these tables so we got a beer from the corner beer bucket girl . $ 5.25 for a can of fat tire . a can . not very impressive . i suppose i could have walked up to the bar area but it was stacked 2 deep with people waiting to get their drinks as well so i decided to go for the easy way out . the shuffleboard game was being used by some 6 year old kids who were playing with the sand and not the pucks but the board itself looked like a cheap one and was not very long . we decided to pass up that game and hoped to play ping pong since there were two tables empty . when we went up front to get the paddles the hostess said `` i guess the people who have those paddles are eating or something '' and we were not allowed to play . the tables sat empty until we left . i noticed on the two tables that were going that there were many instances where people walking down the path were almost hit by the pong players . ping pong does n't seem like a good fit for the small space they put it in . bean bags perhaps , shuffleboard sure , ping pong no . i ca n't comment on the food because we never had a chance to order any and the wait for getting inside the restaurant was over an hour . i am sure the food is descent since it is a fox establishment but the prices i saw seemed a bit steep . again , i am not sure what this place is all about but it definitely did n't feel right to me . i do n't want to be hanging out with my friends drinking adult beverages and dodging 5 year old kids who are screaming and running around with no supervision . is this place meant for families with small kids ? is it mean for college people ? is it made for jocks ? girls that like to get all dressed up ? older folks ? locals ? i saw all of these people there and everyone looked out of place to me . it will be interesting to see how it works during the summer time , i did n't see any misters in that outdoor game area . good luck yard , i doubt i will make it back though .		1		0

absolutely the worst service ever . it took us ten min and me asking someone to get service . another 20 min to get beers and the wait staff is rude . this place is also filthy !! i suggest health inspectors come see this place asap . the ladies restroom was so gross . toilet paper all over the place , a sink clogged and over flowing with rancid stagnant water and there was feces on the wall of a stall . i ca n't imagine what their kitchen looks like . the food is n't bad but not amazing . the pretzels were impressive . wish the service was as half decent as the pretzel . night life here is again interesting ... you wait in an line at the bar for about ten minuets when u finally reach the bar you 're getting hit on by sweaty man who 's wearing way too much cologne . the drinks are nothing special and the service all around is again less than stellar . not impressive . review update !!! i went back against my will but i must say that molly the server is awesome . by far the best service i have ever received at hifi . note to the owners and managers keep this girl around . she is on top of her game and actually seems to care about the company . she was n't our server at first and was still super attentive !! -lrb- she ended up being our server in the end . -rrb- congrats molly on being an amazing server and changing my negative attitude towards this establishment . keep up the great work molly !!		1		0

this past friday , i was downtown with some friends , one who had turned 40 and had never been to a comedy club before , so why not ! tickets were only $ 22 ! wow , ok , to see comedians from chealsea lately show , ok why not ! we received 2 for 1 drink passes to go to the bar next door and they would give us a buzzer to get in prior to people waiting in line . ok that seems like a great deal ! umm . . the 2 for 1 has to be the same drink , the waitress somewhat rude , and kept asking if we wanted food . . nor did she tell us that we can bring the second drink into the show with us . .9:45 came and went , and they were still not allowing people in . when we finally got in , we got center area in the second seating area , so people were walking past us all the time ! and i mean all the time even with the comedians performing ! seriously , people do n't have to get a drink that much ! at least , do it between acts ! but no , all through the show . so our waitress , rude and just unfriendly . .2 drink min . , of course some prices were not on the menu . . a coke $ 3 in a plastic cup , seriously ! and then i was asked at least 2 times , to get my 2nd drink , during the acts ! seriously , can i watch the show ! i just asked for a bottled water to go , she came back with the cap off , so i asked for the cap and she did bring me a new one . $ 5 for water . i got the macaroni and cheese and it was just horrible for it to be $ 12 . . so our check was around $ 50 . i would n't complain , if it was good but it was n't at all . and again , people in front of us the whole time ! even the waitress were standing in front of us , taking the peoples orders in front of us . and like everyone else , we had to wait afterwards for the bill which already had the gratuity added , nor did we add more , service did not deserve it . comedians were ok , not as funny as i thought they would be . all in all , i probably wo n't go back . i went to standup scottsdale and had a totally different experience for the better . i would 've thought this club was in scottsdale and stand up scottsdale was located in phoenix .		1		0
i hate writing negative reviews for local digs , but this place is super shady ! came in on a friday , around 4:30 , and the place was understandably dead . the server comes over and tells us about hh . 1/2 off drinks $ 1.50 tacos . great , i 'll have a margarita on the rocks with salt ! hubby and i order 6 tacos . i am super excited about a good deal . the tacos arrive -- they are about 2 bites each , pretty good , but worth the $ 1.50 we paid . the drinks are great , which should have been a hint something was amiss , but i 'll get to that in a minute ... we order another round of tacos for hubby and another round of drinks . in the meantime , the restaurant slowly begins to fill up , and we lose our server . after about 20 minutes , my husband waves over the manager , who sends another server , who finds our server . she comes over and we order one more round of drinks , which were ordered after happy hour , but we did n't care . our first 2 rounds were half off , so we had no problem ordering a third . after we pay the check , we decided to mosey outside , to the patio , and enjoy our drinks . the patio is facing the busy street , and there are no seats , so we sat on the sill of the window . not very enjoyable , but we wanted a change of scenery . so i ask my husband about the bill , and he is kind of quiet -- it was 72.00 . what ? 3 rounds of happy hour drinks and 9 $ 1.50 tacos ? i was thinking $ 50 . the hostess comes out on the patio , so i asked her about the drinks . how much is a house margarita ? $ 8 . so 50 % is $ 4 , right ? wrong . after taking a second look at the bill , we realized the server charged us for the most expensive margarita , and then upcharged the drink with agave . keep in mind , i ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt . i let the hostess know what happened . she says she will check with the server . the server tells her i ordered a `` good '' margarita . first of all , i was a server for 10 years . i get it . you want to make $ , so you overcharged me . but that is so shady ! second of all , i never ordered a `` good '' margarita . i am not 21 . i get how this works . at this point i am just mad . i love eating out , and i do n't mind spending money on food and drinks . however , i do not like being fleeced . when we walked back through the restaurant , to go to our car , the server walked up to my husband . `` did the hostess explain your bill ? i thought you knew how happy hour works ? '' i feel like if an explanation of the bill in necessary , that is way too complicated for a couple hours out . and , i have been to a lot of happy hours , and i guess barrio cafe 's happy hour is unlike any i have ever been to . and i will never return . shady .		1		0
ok , let me start by saying that my preferred theater is harkins ... i am a very ` thrifty ' person and rarely we go out without using a coupon or some kind of promotional prices . i buy harkins tickets in bulk and i can take a family of 4 to the movies with popcorn and drinks for $ 30-34 . that said , we occasionally go to amc , and each and every time i can not believe they can get away with those prices , particularly the concessions , not offering regular student discounts , etc. . . however , i understand that you get what you pay for , and for some this is the place and environment they want regardless of the price . back to the actual review : -rrb- * hubby drinks industrial amounts of diet coke , so the small glass cup that we got when we got ther was the first ... `` what ? '' it looks and feels like a bar . . -lrb- is it a bar ? -rrb- so it seems appropriate to tip your server , so for more than we were expecting to pay we got a glass full of ice that hubby finished in a couple of sips : p * once we were seated , it seems it took a long time for a server to come and take our order ... perhaps like 30 minutes or so ? * i did n't think the menu options were that attractive , someone in a review compared the place to chili 's and i kind of agree with that ... i am not a big fan of chili 's though ... * we decided to share a chicken/chipotle quesadilla ... which was good and the portion was generous . if you ask me , the sauce was a little too sweet , but oh well ... it was ok . * it seems to me the dish comes with a side -lrb- chips were pictured -rrb- , and while taking our order our server asked `` chips or fries ? '' , at the end we had an extra charge for choosing fries . i understand if there is a charge , but i believe servers should make you aware at the time you place your order . something like ... `` it comes with chips , would you like fries for an additional charge ? '' up until this , it would have been 3 stars , but ... * i did n't think the seats were that comfortable ... they did n't seem to recline and the angle was kind of weird . * honestly , i thought the place was nasty . the small tables have some metal pieces and are not flat , obviously this makes them tricky to clean but that is not an excuse . they had marks of being poorly wiped , there were crumbs on my area , even garbage and a cherry stem in my cup holder ... * over 30 minutes - over 30 minutes it took for my husband to get a refill for his drink ... * and , my pet peeve ... pop corn bags were not full , they were about or more than an inch below the edge or the bag . argggghhh ... * this must have been a very nice and impressive experience when everything was brand new ... not now , not for us . disclaimer - i attended a free screening here , so i did not really get the ` full price paying customer ' experience , however , i think that should not make a difference . or even worse , i would be even more disappointed if i had to pay admission on top of what we spent . on the bright side , this area is very nice to go for a walk after your movie , if you go on the evenings : -rrb-		1		0
blanco sucks . plain and simple . the food sucks ; it 's not even mexican food . the only thing mexican is the fact that they use words you 'd find on a menu at a mexican restaurant . i love other fox restaurants so i was quite surprised . try again guys ... better yet , do n't !		1		0
visited today right @ noon . this is a start up company , they did not have any prices on the wall and the sign on the windows are crooked . we went in to see and try the gelato . no one was behind the counter and no one ever came out , we called out , whistled and everything then we left after a while since no one knew what customers were all about . they should have a bell ring or something when the door opens . as addition to detail is not part of this company . also could not find a list of ingredients anywhere and according to arizona law all food businesses must post a list of ingredients for everything they sell		1		0
offensive . tonight i had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at yasu ; i will never ever go back and i would only recommend it to someone i hate . a group of four of us arrived at yasu for our 6:30 pm reservation and were seated promptly . we chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef 's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that yasu had to offer . i 've had great experiences with chef 's choice at yen , pure , and a number of places in boston so i expected the same from yasu . we entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives . 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe . great play of textures and flavors . kudos . plates are removed and now we are getting excited , sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it ! the special fish selections of the day looked fantastic . about 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course , red snapper carpaccio . it is seared and served at room temperature . one of my pieces had i do n't know , tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks , and frankly , the temp of this dish was iffy . flavors decent , but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri i was anticipating . the restaurant starts filling up . i see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and i nearly squeal with glee ... until i watch it come to rest at another table . this starts happening at a regular pace , and then i realize it 's been a full 30 minutes since we 've had anything at our table . a server comes by so i ask when the next dish will arrive . she mumbles something about the chef 's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away . another cooked plate . a gross mushroom custard , a single shrimp on a skewer , an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce , a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree , and two bits of jumbo clam . everything tastes fine , but we are over the cooked plate situation . yet another 30 minutes goes by . no server , nor manager comes to apologize for the delay . we watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls , nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables . we also watch 4 other couples come in after us , eat loads of food , and leave before us . we are still hungry . next course ... clams in miso broth . we are not offered spoons for the broth . we look at each other , thinking , `` we are at a sushi restaurant , are we not ? '' but go ahead and eat the clams . when the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual sushi part of this dinner . she says yes , we are having live scallops . about 25 more minutes pass and i 'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation . we are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment . the `` live scallops '' are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill . they are so over-cooked they are rubbery . we hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined . finally we tell the server that we are going to have to insist on getting some raw fish on the table . she says that 's what 's coming next . `` next '' meaning another 30 minutes later . we wait so long that finally we tell the server we are not going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check . `` oh your next course is ready ! '' `` we do n't want it . we want to leave '' these are the exact words out of our mouths . instead of bringing the check she brings the plates , telling us that chef yasu `` wants us to have them . '' we all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat . we have now been at yasu for two and a half hours . we 've had five courses that were not enough for two people , much less four . another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives . in that time , the manager has come out , not to rectify the situation , or apologize , but to call us ignorant and classless . he literally looks at us and accuses , `` have you ever had omakase before ? it is always slower . '' we look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this . we also point out that we were expecting sushi , as in raw fish . he tells us we told the server we would eat ` anything ' . i asked him if the name of his restaurant was yen sushi bistro and he looks at me , puzzled . then i see that we have been charged $ 20 for the last course that we twice tried to send back . i speak to the manager who tells me `` if yasu wants to charge you for it , he will charge you for it . '' i kid you not . all in all each course was mercilessly over-worked , only average and yasu is on a major ego trip . do n't waste your time and money here .		1		0
wow . not a good place to go for a drink after work . i went for a work `` happy hour '' to hanny 's last weekend , and could not have been more put off by the rude staff . i arrived and the group i was joining already had drinks , so i went to the bar to grab a drink . i asked the bartender what their happy hour specials were and he looked at me as if i were an idiot and disdainfully said , `` we do n't have a happy hour -lrb- subtext : how terribly gauche of you to even ask -rrb- , but here is our drink menu , '' and then shoved an overpriced wine list at me . i was taken aback , but ordered a glass of pinot grigio , and then told him we were on the same ticket as the group right next to the bar . he said to me , `` well do you have a server ? '' and i replied , `` i do n't know , i just got here ; can you please transfer this drink to that tab ? '' and he could not have been more rude or disgruntled about it . i 'll add that there were a whopping two other people besides my group at the bar , so it 's not like he was overwhelmed with other customers . with service like that , it 's no wonder . there are much better happy hour places you can check out after work - fez , switch , cheuvront all come to mind - so skip the grouchy bartender ` tude and look elsewhere .		1		0
i went with a party of 5 and we split the bill among credit cards/cash . the waiter -lrb- michael p -rrb- overcharged the credit cards and said it was due to the original receipt not reflecting our drink prices . i insisted that he print out the original receipt since i needed it for company expense tracking and sure enough , homeboy pocketed the cash and overcharged us in order to get a bigger tip ! the food is ok but not really worth the price plus i refuse to go back due to michael p pulling a fast one on us .		1		0
alex , the manager , was so rude to us last night . his attitude was so hateful , our whole group of 15 got up and walked out , before evening being seated . not quite how we imagined our friends 21st birthday . what 's really awful is that our group of 15 to 20 people gather there three times a month for dinner , which was mentioned . obviously this guy does n't care for our business . we wo n't be back , as this guy seems to enjoy picking fights and arguing with customers . worst management ever !		1		0

seriously , people giving this place high reviews ? when we went here last , the chicken was dry and had a burnt coating that slid right off . and it was somewhat temperate in the middle , confirming my suspicion that this was made earlier and then just re-fried , cut , and served . i do n't think any restaurant should get any stars when they just open a can or packet -lrb- yes , i 'm talking about the vegetables and sauces -rrb- and mix with pre-cooked meat . that is not good chinese food . as someone who has lived where there are actual chinatowns -lrb- boston and san francisco -rrb- , i know what very good chinese food is , and this place certainly is not . oh , and the lighting . who said that bright , overhead lighting creates a pleasant atmosphere for dining ? i have yet to find a chinese restaurant here in the phoenix area that actually puts together fresh ingredients from scratch . if anyone knows of one , please let me know .		1		0
i 've eaten here three times . the first two times were outstanding . the third time was not a charm . the food was almost inedible . our first course was a dumpling dish that had so much wasabi in it that i was in physical pain trying to eat the dish . the second course was an inedible fish dish . i do n't think the fish was fresh . the waitress , to her credit , saw that we were not enjoying the food and took it away . we asked for the check and finished our drinks ... we did n't complain and were not going to make a scene . this is when things got weird . the chef -lrb- owner ?? -rrb- came out and insisted that his food was good . to prove it he insisted that we sample some other dishes . he brought some sort of fish stew that was inedible -lrb- again the fish was n't fresh -rrb- ... at that point we paid the check and snuck out of the restaurant before he could serve us any additional food . i wo n't be back . it is a shame because the first two times i ate at sens the food was delicious . however , the hallmark of a good restaurant is that the food is good every time .		1		0
so i figured out why this place has 5 from one and 1 from another ... it is owned ny our friends up north . yep the super nice yet bland group we call canadians . they have created a tourist trap that appeals to tourist and lovers of sw crap . lol here is a copy of the business plan . lets create a super nice place that attracts people to it , eah ? -lrb- cuz they end the sentence with a question -rrb- but we do know anything about mexican food ? lets make it so neat just to be in the place that we will get by on our looks ? eah ? okaay ... make sure the drinks are good .		1		0

plenty of really hot chicks with douchebags to be seen here . which is true of most scottsdale nightclubs i 'm dragged to by my unrefined friends who keep insisting we `` alternate '' between the much cooler venues of central phoenix , and scottsdale . so if this is your scene , have at it . sorry scottsdalers . i 'd raise my family there if i had kids but otherwise i 'm just not a big fan . ; -rrb-		1		0
had the 2nd worst meal ever here , behind only vincent 's on camelback -lrb- feel free to see my review of that place -rrb- i wish i would have remembered the old chef left at the start of august it started pretty poorly , then they started cooking which made things even worse walking in there was on one to greet us , we had to track down the hostess -lrb- not a big deal but a minor quibble , with the pricing they have that is something that should never happen -rrb- they ran out of the tasting menu at 8pm on a saturday on the holiday weekend , as well as they running out of pasta - we were informed after being seated , ordering drinks and a bottle of wine , and deciding on the tasting menu - so at least 15-20 minutes passed since sitting down with zero mention of them being out of anything , which should have been mentioned when we were presented with the menu 's all of the fish dishes -lrb- ciappino and halibut -rrb- were overcooked and dry , as were the short ribs -lrb- which is hard to do -rrb- my tenderloin came out rare vs med rare -lrb- which is fine for me -rrb- but was overly salty to the point it was about inedible , and also had a piece of bacon on top of it - why would you ruin a good piece of meat with strip of bacon on top - made no sense , sent it back the cocktails there were very poor , french 75 i think only looked at the gin bottle instead actually having any poured in and the whiskey smash which was on their `` special '' menu was terrible - if travis is a good bartender or runs a good bar program this was certainly not evident , and they have a mai tai listed on the menu but do n't even have orgeat listed as an ingredient so that was enough to steer me off of that one , but i am sure it would have been very orangey and come in a collins glass with a slice of orange the only bright spot which was small -lrb- literally undersized -rrb- was the foie gras , which was done very well and seared , with a light jam underneath the toast , and some peanut butter-ish spread on the side with some huckleberries - however the portion was about the size of a tasting menu portion not an appetizer portion - perhaps they were running out of foie gras as well , but i do n't expect 3 bites out of a $ 16 app poor all the way around - do not waste your money here		1		0
so before mccormick ranch opened this was my morning hangout . . id get there about 3am to get my work out done before work and of course the crowds . the night guy was apparently friends with all the scottsdale homeless -lrb- yes there are homeless in scottsdale -rrb- so he would kindly let them in to take showers and such . well , i think that 's a cool thing to do however many homeless people have mental problems and do not discriminate on who they flip out on , including yours truly ! i was putting my bag away when some homeless asshole came out of the shower area and proceeded to yell at me ! i could n't understand what he was saying -lrb- like had had marbles in his mouth -rrb- but he was animate about something . . when i finally had enough and turned around to call the cops he started apologizing . . jackoff ! okay , so whatever , i went and did my work out . . then i came back to the locker room and stripped to take shower ... when i got to my favorite stall -lrb- creature of habit -rrb- someone had taken a huge fucking shit right there in the shower stall ! can you fucking believe it ? though it was a perfect shit pile , kind of like when you pour soft serve ice cream into a bowl . . i was so grossed out i took a whores bath in another area and left . on my way out i told front desk guy what had happened there . . he looked at me and asked if i was sure . . how fucking sure can a turd in the shower stall be ? its pretty damn real ! he looked at me like i did it or something . jackoff number 2 ! this place is like a 100 dollar whore . . she looks pretty good on the outside but once you go down on her , you really wish you had n't .		1		0

the brioche french toast was one of the nastiest things i 've ever eaten . i was not going to wait in line at the cenpho location so we made a trip to the lesser known newer one for our first over easy experience . i 'm quite a fan of french toast and i 'm always on the lookout for the perfect french toast . this was not it . not only did the filling turn the center of the toast into a giant tapioca-looking mushfest but the batter that coats the french toast does nothing to give it flavor . it 's called vanilla people , a big bottle at costco is only $ 4 . use it . what a disgusting mess . i tried putting the syrup on it . of course , it did n't come with `` real maple syrup '' but i was welcome to use the catsup bottle at the table that had been filled with the thinnest , corn-syrup based syrup known to man . at least my meal had some flavor after that . this will be my one and only trip to any over easy -lrb- or other aaron may restaurant -rrb- . what a joke .		1		0
i rue this place . loath it . despise it . scowl whenever i think of my experience here . i 'd give this place 0 or negative stars , if i could . sure , i can see how people would enjoy the low key atmosphere and the camaraderie of friends at a bar in scottsdale that 's not the least bit pretentious . it 's not the bar , per se , that i have a problem with - it 's the absurd activities during the week . -lrb- of course , giligin 's has made its name based on its weekly events . -rrb- ok , so i can laugh about a midget bartender just like everyone else can . that 's funny . sure , a midget stripper pole . also funny . scantily clad women handing out free shots ? eh , that does n't even faze me nowadays . it 's not even the goldfish races that bother me . i guess it 's the man in charge on the evening i went . lewd . crude . obscene . disrespectful . sure , some people may like this , but i definitely do n't . i do n't want to hear a string of curse words coming out of a man holding a fishing pole with a dildo attached to the end . i do n't want to see him waving it around in people 's faces . i sure as hell do n't want to see the end of the fishing line smack into a woman 's face and the man laugh uproariously , calling the female all kinds of names and insinuating she likes it . you call this amusement ? this is fun ? this is entertainment ? no . this is b.s. . when you have to humiliate and degrade people to have a laugh , then you need to reconsider how you spend your downtime . ok , so maybe i 'm coming off a bit strong here . it just riles me up to think people actually enjoy going out to be humiliated and talked down to , like they 're scum . it annoys me to know a man is employed to be a complete and utter jackass . and , on top of that , the crowd urges him on while getting rapaciously sloshed . i will never go back here . i want nothing to do with a place like this . in fact , i feel sort of bad for anyone who likes this place for the sheer fact that they can get a verbal beating by a dude with an iq lower than the goldfish he torments . if that 's your bag , enjoy . just leave me out of it .		1		0
we were really excited to order from the new pizza place in our neighborhood , however , when we called tonight , the girl who answered the phone acted downright irritated that we called . i mean , really really irritated . not even halfway through the call i was already tired of the attitude , so i decided to hang up . this household doesnt support business that act like they dont want our business . manager that girl needs a serious talking to in regards to customer service .		1		0
i really do n't know what the rave about this place is !? came here on a monday afternoon for lunch and ordered the single burger with some fries . the gal at the counter was super nice and cool . however , i ca n't say the same for the burger . pretty simple one patty burger with tomatoes , onions , and pickles ... um ... yeah that 's about it . my patty was not super dry , but darn close . the bun was you basic hamburger bun . so really why does it cost what it cost for such a simple burger . because it 's made with a `` modern '' grill ? i could get the same at mc ` ds and be more content and plus at least i 'll get a toy with it in a pretty box . mines with in a brown bag with modern burger stamp ... yahhhh ... . . : -lrb- overall , i 'm baffle why people would compare this burger as one of the best in town . shame on you fools ! i was n't even in a bad mood when i came -- was totally in an awesome mood so nope -- last time i checked i do n't have those time of the months . maybe someday i 'll feel to give this a try , but for now ; sorry folks ca n't recommend - enjoy !		1		0
if i could give zero stars , i would . just about the worst experience for my friend and i . we came in for a quick and easy dinner . after being ignored at the door way repeatedly , we sat ourselves . first , we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus , but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back . our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving . i have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone . they 're lazy , slow , and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there . the happy hour prices are great , but there are other ra 's so do yourself a favor and go to a different location .		1		0
a small group of us went here to eat several weeks ago ... they were n't so busy that there was a wait , but the table we wanted outside was still dirty . we were tired and starving so we sat down anyway after they promised to have it cleaned straight away . 20 minutes later , nobody had offered to take our drink order , but we managed to get someone to take most of the disgusting plates off of our table . we had asked a few people to send someone out to take our order and the table next to us that had been seated after us had gotten menus and drinks . they must 've not understood that we were new customers even though the hostess knew , the waiter whos section it was new , and the bus boy and bartender both knew as well because we told them . i guess the filthy plates of half-eaten food and slime were tricking them . the five of us sat there trying to talk over the sounds of our gurgling stomachs as we waited for about a half hour without menus , drinks or any indication we were going to get served ... finally , an off-duty employee came out and asked us if we had been served . we said no and that we were leaving and he flipped out . he said he was n't on the clock so he could n't help us , but he would try to flag someone down immediately . in the end , the place smelled very fishy -lrb- which you should know is a bad sign when eating at a fish restaurant - especially sushi -rrb- and we decided to just split and get food elsewhere . between the fishy smell and the non service , there was n't much keeping us there . the place looked kinda nice and i 'm sure we just had an isolated experience - but until i actually try again and get some food and service , this will have to be my review - one star . if the place had been ultra packed , i might have forgiven this a little more .		1		0
i had a craving for frozen yogurt and fresh fruit . i was desperate to satisfy this craving convincing myself that maybe this time i 'll have a change of heart and actually like the frozen yogurt at yogurtini . i got tart froyo and topped it off with strawberries , mangos , and pineapple . the fruit tasted like it was frozen . my sister got island coconut and added some toppings to it and it tasted okay . it was over $ 10 for the both of us . i would n't recommend this place to anyone unless you like over paying for crappy frozen yogurt .		1		0
i just do n't get it . this place is like a homeless shelter but with even worse food . i know it 's southern style ... but everything is double fried ... and you walk out of their feeling like death . it 's expensive -lrb- $ 25 pp with soda -rrb- and just not quality food . this is worth a big skip ...		1		0
another popular place in phoenix but i got ta say why ? the food is the average run of the mill type you find all over phoenix and what a disappointment that is after waiting 2 + hours to get in . the atmosphere is nice but the services lacks and the attitude reminds me of a restaurant better suited for a scottsdale location . you defiantly get a sense from the place that they think they are the cats meow . totally over priced for what you get and the quality . try the parlor or cibo less attitude better food .		1		0
sad to say , but i do n't feel the love at chompies anymore . it used to be a touch of home , but prices have gone way up , and service has gone way down . my last visit left me feeling nickeled and dimed to death . truth told , it was more dollared to death . i ordered a bagel and lox plate and was given a tiny amount of cream cheese . when i ran out and asked for more ... they charged me $ 2.29 . they never brought my table any pickles , and they charged extra for someone 's bread . we had to flag down the waitress a couple of times . she never stopped at our table unless we sent someone to find her . we left having spent almost $ 60 for 3 breakfast entrees , and that is pretty sad .		1		0
men walking around with a smile on their face saying please shoot me i hate my life . the women hanging on there mans arm with a smile on her face cause she has him trapped in her living hell , with their 2.5 beastly children running around driving every other patron of the place nuts while mom & dad ignore them . yeah , let 's go shopping for cheap clothes and home goods made in a third world country by an eight year old child , or let 's eat a place that you can eat at anywhere in the usa and not taste a drop of seasoning !		1		0
** full disclosure ** i only came here for drinks , not the food . a group of us walked into carly 's after our holiday lunch in order to grab some drinks and get our evening started . we were greeted with a look of disgust -lrb- we werent even rowdy ! -rrb- and poor service . the place was empty save 2 other people but it took about 25 min to get our 4 beers and 2 cocktails . i was kind of disappointed because i really wanted to like the place . there was great music and it really had the potential to be a great hangout spot in the future . we left after we finished our 1 drink . sorry , carly 's . you really missed the mark .		1		0

so we found out why people hate this place . we were cut off after probably drinking enough cocktails , but that is not the bad part . i understand when a restaurant thinks someone has had enough to drink and they say no more . the crazy part is they also cut us off from eating ... what ??? awkward and embarrassing , wo n't be back : - -lrb-		1		0
well , this review is based on the sushi alone -- so 1 star . if i was reviewing the bar - 5 stars ! anyway -- if you actually enjoy ra sushi , i wonder if you 're only eating vegas rolls and potsickers . i know your type : new to sushi , want to get drunk with your friends and pretend to actually enjoy raw fish . i know , i know ... you 're in college and it 's mill ave. i am fine to get trashed here , i love their bartenders and inventive drinks ... but the food is nast . that 's ra in a nutshell .		1		0
i agree with yuck . this is a boring loud terrible place to eat . the food is below average and a waste of money . much better places to eat then here . my dad had the meatball sub which was huge but nothing special about it just ordinary . i ordered the gluten free pizza - but it was not good - the sauce tasted like hunt 's tomatoe paste - maybe if they had a home cooked sauce it would have been better . plus there gluten free pizza is not really gluten free because they make it in the same ovens as their wheat pizza . and it was terrible , we sent items back and threw stuff away . if you are looking for good ny pizza try nypd much better than this place by far .		1		0

after reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews i was hesitant to post mine thinking i just had a bad experience . i decided to try my luck again and went to ponchos for dinner last night . i now have been there a few times and my experience has been consistently horrible . first of the all the place used to be a house , now converted to a restaurant . usually this is a great and charming idea , but it does n't seem to work for me . the rooms are incredibly crowded and you are either screaming at your dining partner or -lrb- loudly -rrb- overhearing the table next to you . imagine trying to fit 5 restraunt booths in to a small bedroom . . to close for comfort . the food - i 'm sorry my fellow yelpers but i honestly think it is horrible . the chips have always been to greasy , they only serve hot sauce and you have to pay for salsa . lame . i have had many entrees -lrb- where 's the pollo under all this fundido -rrb- -lrb- chimichanga greasemanga -rrb- but last night won the `` most disgusting entree '' award . i order the steak picado -lrb- i think that 's what it was called -rrb- and it came out overcooked and cold . the rice and beans were barely edible , the cheese in my garnish and beans were melted stiff but there were also bits of cold -lrb- what appeared to be -rrb- sandwich cheese sprinkling the plate and hiding under the steak . it was supposed to come with tomatillo sauce but came with their normal salsa heated up . . my friend ordered the huevos rancheros and it was even worse , the eggs were rubbery and greasy at the same time . they were covered in a slimy sauce they passed off as ranchero but it seems like a watered down green sauce . it was so bad he did n't even eat it . do n't get me wrong - i love mexican , all types and usually the heavier the better , but ponchos is a place i will not be returning . yes it was really cheap , but you get what you pay for . . picture attached .		1		0

i am an art lover but do n't dig the overkill by the people who are `` guarding '' the art from the common folk . after having a run-in with an over-zealous guard and then discussing it with heather the manager , i will most likely not return . they are many friendlier art installations in the valley ... i will give them my hard-earned support instead .		1		0
i do n't even care about authenticity issues . i 'd eat a sushi filled with a taco if it was delicious . the food here is just criminally bland .		1		0
this is a cry for help . i feel like this place is destined to be a place on restaurant impossible . from the start there were issues . we waited at the front to be seated for several minutes while there were only a couple tables filled . i think there were only 2 servers working which was clearly understaffed but also seemed like its probably normal . the food was bad . as in , my chile relleno tasted rotten . it was filled with some gross greasy cheese mess and had doubly greasy batter that it was fried in . i honestly would n't have fed this to a pig . i probably have more to say but i feel that any more effort is unnecessary and would be a lost cause .		1		0
i am honestly shocked by the high reviews of this place . when there are so many fabulous mexican food restaurants in arizona , do not waste your money here . the pros : 1 . neat decor and location the cons : 1 . chips and salsa for $ 7.00 !!!! are you kidding me ? you get them free at almost every other mexican food restaurant . that should have been my warning sign . 2 . the rest of the food was outrageously expensive . 3 . the quality of this over-priced food was sub-par at best . i had the fajitas and they were just not good . 4 . the bathroom sink was very unique and after taking a few minutes to discover where the water was actually coming from i found that the water was actually passing over black mold ! this was enough to make me want to vomit since i had washed my hands before eating my not so good fajitas . 5 . a 20 % gratuity was added on our bill . i felt that was a bit presumptuous . 15 % is acceptable for a gratuity then let me add more if i want to . 20 % is not a given . 6 . this is petty , but they spelled `` chipotle '' wrong on one of their menu items . overall , i was very disappointed in this place . there are so many great , award winning mexican food restaurants in scottsdale alone , why waste your money here ? i wo n't return .		1		0
this place is seriously not good . the noodles are dry and lack flavor . my friend got the pad-thai , not good either . both tasted like dog food smells . if i could imagine how dog food tastes it probably tastes like the dishes they serve here . i do n't know about the other dishes but any noodle dish is gross here . could n't even push myself to eat half . the staff was helpful and asked if we were okay and we just were straight up with them that the food was not appetizing . there was n't a solution to the problem so we just got the check and got up out of there .		1		0
i read that the service was poor , and , my fellow yelpers , you do n't lie . we were greeted with a generous helping of silence , followed by disbelief when my friends tried to order off the menu for lunch . i ca n't take them anywhere , but it was my fault , i know that they wo n't do a buffet . so , after being told that it would take a while , we were informed that the gyro would not be coming . after that , my friends watched me enjoy the buffet , which was followed by my friend who was now on a forced diet because his gyro did n't make it and me watching friend number two eat . the food is actually good , and i love buffets , but i do n't think we 'll be going back .		1		0
after reading judy f. 's update , i will no longer go to this establishment . i was a big supporter of this cafe when it was at the esplanade , however reading judy b. or frenchie b 's comments , private and a review , i will never send anyone there . and i 've sent many , saying the desserts are wonderful . the desserts may be wonderful , however , that type of attitude is not needed from those who are related to the owners or who are the owners . very disappointing . desserts are worth more than mc d 's yes however the attitude is not worth my time , therefore , i will have my caramel sundae for a $ 1or support another local cafe . all yelpers try to help locals , however , this cafe does n't seem to care and approach the reviews very defensively .		1		0

i forgot how disappointing this local chain is . i wo n't make this mistake again . we went on a busy friday night , when the restaurant was packed . parking was more plentiful than either of the old locations , but that was probably the last plus of the evening . -lrb- well , not quite -- the bathroom was clean . -rrb- the restaurant is poorly laid out and very loud . every seat was full , making it nearly impossible to hear my boyfriend two feet away . sitting at a table next to the main pathway along the large dining room was n't much different from sitting on the edge of the food court in grand central station . if you want to get hit in the back of the head by a half-dozen knock-off purses , this is the place to go . our waitress was impossible to hear , but she managed to catch our orders . she did n't look us in the eye the whole evening . her annoyance at this job was absolutely clear , and i do n't blame her . the place has a miserable ambiance . i 'd hide in the kitchen too . the salad was fine , though it would have been nice had the waitress had let me speak -lrb- to say i wanted to remove the onions -rrb- before she started tossing it . the bread was good . i ordered the capellini checca , which was absolutely shameful . this restaurant has decided to take the `` cutting corners because we do n't care '' route that chef ramsey sees so often . there was about a cup of water in the bottom of the large bowl of angel hair , and the advertised `` fresh roma tomatoes '' were actually canned but chopped whole tomatoes . -lrb- it 's june -- tomatoes are in season , for goodness sake . -rrb- it was a flavorless mess of powered garlic , a shard or two of basil , overcooked store pasta , water , and `` tomatoes '' . you 'll be far happier at olive garden .		1		0
went for lunch today . no wait to get a table , about the only good thing about this visit . from here our waitress could n't remember my wife 's drink order , could n't seem to refill anyone 's drink very quickly , took 40 minutes to get our food and most of it was cold when we got it . when we told the waitress , she said `` really ? it just came off the line ! '' normally i would send it back or tell the manager , but we had a birthday party to go to so we just wolfed it down and left . i loved the north scottsdale location but this one has horrible service , i will avoid at all costs . i was not the only one , i heard others complaim as we were leaving too !		1		0
never in my life have i been so happy to dine and dash before . i wo n't give a time it happened , nor will i ever return , so i honestly do n't fear retribution . but after waiting 30 minutes between drinks , and then never saw the waitress again i was so fed up with this place i just walked the fuck out . if they do n't care enough about the customers to at least make their rounds every 5-10 minutes to see if we are happy . then they certainly do n't care about my money . which by the way i would have been happy to give them . the drinks were good . but i was sober before the next one arrived . unless they are freezing the ice cubes to order , there is no reason for a delay . i 'm not going to cause a fuss and complain to the manager . i 'm sure the wait on a manager would have been just as bad as the service . so kick rocks . i 'm out . from my experience , i really do n't think this establishment deserves more then 1 star . i would give 0 if it was possible .		1		0
in the interest of cheap wings , my boyfriend and i decided to visit the buffalo wild wings on their $ 0.60 wing thursdays . that was our first mistake . we got to the restaurant at about 3:00 pm , and it was completely deserted . this was n't a bad thing , but it was kind of eerie in such a large sports bar . we were hoping to take advantage of happy hour drink specials , but their happy hour does not start until 4:00 pm . consisting of 27 wings in 3 different flavors and an order of fries , it took about 15 minutes for our order to arrive . these were the nastiest wings i had ever seen ; they appeared to be deep fried and then sparingly slathered with different types of sauce . the sauce-to-wing distribution was inconsistent ans stingy . some of the sauce even appeared to be congealed because it was improperly heated . the fries were just as disappointing as the wings . they cost $ 3.69 and were smaller than the portion size available at in-n-out burger -lrb- not as delicious as ino might i add -rrb- . the total for our 27 wings , one order of fries and two waters was around $ 30 . now i can think of many restaurants that i would have preferred over buffalo wild wings that serve much better food similar pricing . this negative experience was exacerbated by the fact that we came here because it was cheap . tl ; dr : do n't eat here if you have any sense of dignity .		1		0

`` you get what you pay for !

blech . this is really a piss poor excuse for an outlet mall . here 's what outlet mall means to megan : stores like nordstrom rack , off 5th , banana republic , coach , jcrew , kenneth cole , burberry , ann taylor , shoes stores galore . there are decent food options and i want to lazily spend my day shopping with some girlfriends . here 's what you get at anthem : gap outlet , nike outlet , some random stores , polo , guess , and a few sketchy nail places . the food options are deplorable and the only time i want to spend here with girlfriends is to find a t-shirt or something . this place has the potential to be so much more but it 's really hideous . the only other outlet mall is arizona mills and i wo n't go there -lrb- literally and figuratively -rrb- . arizona has no good outlet shopping and i 'm not about to trek to palm springs to shop . i do n't mind the open air concept because in the summer , the misters work just fine . but this is n't a place i want to shop at in general so i do n't care . the stores that i do like are nice , well-organized and clean , do n't get me wrong , but one can only subsist on three-armed shirts for so long .		1		0
after a long morning of volunteering at a local animal shelter my coworkers and i sat down at the famous -lrb- infamous -rrb- los dos molinos for a filling lunch . i know 10 people at lunch is a challenge , but the place was empty and we were treated like it was a major inconvenience . service was slow and unfriendly , i was never asked if i even wanted a drink , i had to make a significant assertion to get one glass of diet coke . i ordered two chicken tacos with no cheese , no beans ... i know , it sounds boring , but it is what i wanted to have for lunch . i received pork tacos and a plate full of beans . so how was the food ? i can imagine dog waste tasting better than the taco that i ate . hell , i can make better soft tacos in my home kitchen anytime and run circles around this place . additionally , my coworker did not get his chili relleno until 15 minutes after everyone else was served and it looked more like soft green chili slop more than anything else . to top it all off it took ages to get a check and when we did they would not allow us to pay separately ... needless to say i will not be returning to this place . for much better food , service and cleanliness check out la pinata near 16th ave and thomas ... it is awesome .		1		0
i effing hate this place ! i will only come here for a band i just can not miss . tickets - online in advance is more expensive than buying at the door . they 'll charge you like $ 6 for buying online & another undisclosed $ 3 for will call . lying cheating bastards . lines & waiting - i did n't have to wait at all . there were barely any people there yet . i got there at 6:30 and ended up pretty close to the stage . frisking & pat downs - these will be done by a same gendered person . girls , they 'll want to look in your purse . this is pretty much against the 4th amendment : `` the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated ... '' but if you bitch they have the right to refuse service/entrance . fun ! decor & cleanliness - it 's pretty dirty everywhere . but that 's to be expected . lots of people coming & going all the time . you 'll look up to see that the ceiling is bare & exposed . pray your bladder holds out on you until you can get to another location . do n't even go into the restrooms if you do n't have to , you 'll wish you had a hazsmat suit on . yuck ! drinks - there 's a bar & they do n't separate people under 21 . i imagine it would be easy for an older friend to get under 21 people drunk in the crowd :d heat - it 's constantly hot . no matter what the weather outside is like go dressed like you do in the middle of summer phx heat . there was 1 lousy fan blowing . it might as well not even have been there . music - for some reason between bands they play weird music that does n't fit the style you 're there to see . i saw fireworks , saves the day , hellogoodbye , & new found glory . they played 80 's pop music . ok ... sound - the sound did n't suck as much as other reviews led me to believe . it 's up to the band to make the sound people get it right . hellogoodbye made sure they sounded good . saves the day , not so much . security - never enough !!! there were some big beefy dudes up front to push back or catch the crowd surfers . i saw 2 guys actually in the crowd . with all the moshing going on , that 's not gon na cut it . people got kicked in the head , elbowed , spit on , stepped on , pushed , almost crushed , & even i almost got into a fight w / a short asshole mosher that might have been a guy ... perhaps when his balls drop . prepare to leave with bruises . basically , this place is like an armpit or perhaps the donkeys ass of venues . fail .		1		0
i do n't know how much worse this place can be . i tried the happy valley location with an awful experience a year ago and decided to give mellow mushroom another chance when they had a groupon . bad idea . the first incident of this meal was getting a dirty water glass . this was n't just ` dirty , ' it was caked with food on the bottom . i did n't notice for a second . . there was food floating in my water . . and when i took a closer look , the bottom of the glass had dough or some sort of sauce sitting there looking back at me . our server did n't seem surprised and did n't apologize . i guess this happens all the time ? i asked for my water in a to-go cup . we waited over 30min on a wednesday evening to get our small pizza and sandwich -- with less than half the restaurant full . our waiter was nowhere to be found for water refills . i ordered a small mega-veggie pizza and my boyfriend ordered their steak and cheese hoagie . this was probably the worst veggie pizza i 've ever had . there 's something off about the dough and it 's greasy as hell . i had more cheese on my pizza than veggies -lrb- and the taste of the veggies was weird -- like one of the vegetable toppings was starting to go bad -rrb- . and tofu on this pizza ? it 's overkill and it 's not doing anyone any favors and i 'm sure it 's gmo soy . his hoagie was okay , summing up his sandwich as `` giving me more than i need does n't make it better . '' this sandwich was overflowing with meat . i ate less than one slice and decided to box up the rest . as we were walking out , i dumped my leftovers . i 've never ever thrown away almost a whole pizza . seriously -- how can you get it so wrong ? bad food . dirty glasses . apathetic service . the only redeeming quality ? their beer draft selection .		1		0
i have to say , this one is not a good sushi at all . this one is one of the worst sushi ever . costco sushi even taste better than this . i 'm sorry , i know that this place just open a week ago , but . . i ca n't say anything positive about the food . the place used to be a fastfood restaurant -lrb- hawaian bbq -rrb- that is being converted into sushi join . but with no sushi bar -lrb- surprise -rrb- . yes the place have a great service , friendly and bright . but i 'm only rate based on quality of the food . yes i 'm in phoenix , but still , there are some other decent place to eat . unless they fix on how they prepare the sushi . they 'll not get any repeat customer . yes they gave me free ice-cream and other sashimi .		1		0

sorry , but i hate this pathetic place ! usually full of total losers , yet it gets pretty crowded . poor phoenix , people just do n't know better in this city . it 's kinda sad , actually . then when an a super cool & totally fun event comes to club stratus on 23rd ave near grand , hardly anyone goes ! it 's way better , more modern & no rif-raf losers . it is more ` circuit party-ish '' , which phoenix lacks , otherwise , you would have to leave the damn state to attend a circuit party event , which is pretty much nonexistent in az . .		1		0
okay to quote the stones ; you 're not the only one , with mixed emotions ! i am and will continue to be a loyal sw airlines customer , i 've only traveled with them , and i must say i dont have any complaints with the pilots , sexy stews , and the quality of their planes prices yada yada yada but -lrb- and this is an epic but , like kim kardashian 's , or j.lo 's , or kirstie alley 's or ... well you get the picture -rrb- whoever the ambivalent imp , who haphazardly handled this patrons luggage on my return trip from california , is should be dragged out from his hiding place , sealed inside the thunderdome and viciously torn to shreds by a mutant with retard strength - while i cackle from a platform with a silver lightning shaped streak in my jew fro and the sequins on my bedazzled tina turner outfit glimmer in the dusk of a day permeated with my vengeance . * cough cough * ahem where was i. . . oh yeah , my huge beef with this airline is how careless the baggage handlers are , i 've watched them unload peoples bags from their little carts they drive around the tarmac on , and those guys act as if they 're lobbing piles of garbage off a dump truck . i have , no had , a vintage wwii rucksack my uncle gave me for christmas one year that i used to use for all my travels . it was sturdy and had survived a fucking world war for christ sake ! well once the careless monkeys sw employs to handle their customers baggage got their mits on it , it returned to me from the baggage carousel with two of its leather straps broken , and some articles missing . giant wtf moment for me , minor incident for them . no scratch that , it isnt an incident if you cant even get an apology out of a single one of their employees . needless to say nowadays i pack light enough to ensure i dont have to check my bags .		1		0
wednesday , august 20th was a sad day for me . the sandwich shop which i adored and the sub that i worshipped are no longer what they used to be . bought two cold italian combos and took them home to hubby . we were going to watch a special tv show and really enjoy ourselves with our sandwiches and beers . upon unraveling the sandwiches from the wrapper , we noticed that the cold cuts , formerly thinly sliced were thickly sliced -- so unappealing . being from the east coast , the mantra at the deli was always : `` slice it thin '' . the layers and layers of thin cold cuts and cheese made it so delectable . i also noticed that the cappicola was almost non-existent . the lettuce was overdressed such that the bread was soaked wet by the time i got home . the tomatoes were like cardboard so i threw them away -lrb- i hate throwing out food-it 's unholy but i just could n't eat them -rrb- . hubby was so disgusted with the sandwich that he would n't eat it -lrb- neither would i for that matter -rrb- . i ended up cooking and the next day i threw out the sandwiches which i had refrigerated in the hopes that they would somehow improve over time . so here i am , knowing that i 'll never have a capriotti sandwich like the one they used to make and which had me looking forward to every bite . what happened capriotti ?????		1		0
it 's so funny ... these people take the time to post the menu for each day online ... and then do n't have it . we planned all week to eat osso bucco on saturday , and then they do n't have it ! someone forgot to heat it up ... that 's what they said ! service ? ugh . food ? how would i know ? they could n't come up with my entree ! now we 're down to 2699 other italian restaurants in this town to try ...		1		0
pricy , and kind of unclean . i ordered a las vegas roll and some other shit , he reached in the fridge , right in front of me . . pulled out a premade roll , dolloped some shit on it and handed it to me . i 've waited longer for a fucking hamburger at mcdonalds . . the seared tuna i ordered was also seared in advance . i asked the guy about it , and he said : `` we make like 500 a day . '' i replied `` how many do you think they make in japan ? '' . . disappointing , lazy , and super gamey tasting shit . oh , and ask me like ten more times if i want to join your fucking birthday club .		1		0
i do n't get the obsession with this place . the tortillas are fresh but other than that everything is literally dripping in grease but not much flavor . service is also slow considering it is set up as fast food . plus any place that closes on sunday gets an automatic loss of a star from me .		1		0
i took advantage of the groupon and took a party of 7 for lunch today . the menu online stated `` choose any 2 items , combination of soup , salad , pasta for $ 9.95 '' of course when we got there that was no longer on the menu . we were looking at $ 16 pastas once again . not one person in my group was pleased with their meal . i ordered the burger and it was burnt to a crisp as was the bun , my friend ordered the same burger medium and it was burnt on the outside and bloody in the center . i could actually take the burger and only use half of the bun the amount of meat was so small . the pasta salad it was served with was bland , the vegetable sandwich was the ass end of the veggies . all in all everything was less than acceptable . i gave you another chance boa , and while you boast of fresh quality ingredients you do n't deliver on quality food or realistic prices . sadly i wo n't be back .		1		0
i only write reviews on yelp to help people save their money . ten bucks for a small sandwich and a drink . `` the bobbie '' which is supposed to be their signature sandwich is cold shredded turkey -lrb- maybe a 2 oz portion at most -rrb- cold stove top stuffing and cold cranberry sauce smushed in a rubbery piece of bread . no sides ! if my co worker was n't the one who picked this up and i was eating it inside the restaurant , i would march up to the counter and ask for a refund . my toddler could make this better in his sleep . of all the years working in scottsdale , this is hands down , the biggest ripoff for lunch . how they are still in business after a year is beyond me . garbage .		1		0
i was not impressed by grimaldi 's in the slightest , and i am a very forgiving and understanding customer . the girl who served us seemed like she was ready to go home . she took our order , someone else brought the meal , and she checked on us once . then my drink ran out and i found a bug in my food . so i 'm peering around trying to get her attention unaware that she had already left and our server had changed . i suppose she forgot to mention that if we needed anything , we should ask someone else . moving on to the bug . i 've worked at restaurants and know that these things happen . would n't have even caused a slight deduction if it were handled the way it should have been . i very quietly brought it to the attention of one of the hosts -lrb- since i could n't find the disappearing waitress -rrb- the bartender seemed genuinely sorry . i could n't eat the pizza anymore because all the spices looked like a butt of the fruitfly that i had just dug out of cheese pizza with my finger * ugh * the manager insisted the bug got there after he gave it to me and he `` knew '' that it was n't baked in . he comped the pizza and took it away . i ordered a canoli since i was still hungry but really grossed out , and we each got a coffee with liqueur . so we spent 30 dollars on a ruined dinner . we ordered our sodas to go with the pizza , we ordered the canoli to replace the pizza that i was starving for and did n't get to eat . i know how a good restaurant works , and a. you do not tell the customer that she was wrong and she did not just dig a bug from inside of her food and b . you do n't charge her for her drinks and replacement food -lrb- especially when it 's a 4 $ canoli -rrb- . you charge for the booze if there was any -lrb- and there was -rrb- so i 'm home , an hour of my day is gone , and i 'm still hungry . what i had of the food was good but i would eat dominos before paying for service that i do n't receive .		1		0
so disappointed in this event . i 'm grateful that people are so fond of food trucks but i 'm super unhappy that i did n't get to participate in the way that i wanted . the traffic was horrible . did they not cap the ticket sales ? for 25 food trucks , there were 13,000 people ? that 's 520 people per truck - no wonder it took several hours for people to wait in line and get food ! no normal restaurant can serve that many people . planning was awful , parking was awful . charging for parking , ticket entry , and food ? wow . dear salt river fields , next time cap the ticket sales -- maybe a few thousand at most . charge more if you have to -lrb- clearly people are interested -rrb- . invite more food trucks !		1		0
i really hate to do this downgrade , but i have to for the sake of all those that love good beer and some sort of decent service . after my fourth visit , i 'll likely refrain from stopping in to wob for quite some time . 15 minutes at a table , and 10 at the bar , and still no one would talk to us to take our orders and money . even after trying to flag folks down at the bar and table , my friends and i were totally ignored . sure , they have a phenomenal selection of beer , but that does n't do me a bit of good if no one will take my order . the employees were too busy yucking it up with each other to pay us any mind at all . hopefully they 'll educate their employees here pretty soon . i would love to spend money here , but they have to want to take it , first .		1		0

i have eaten here before and the food is tasty but today when i went in for happy hour at the bar i was shocked at the lack of professionalism displayed by the staff . they were all talking very loud and swearing while showing each other images on their phones . not only that but the bartender girl was constantly texting on her phone rather than paying attention to her customers . i am pretty sure the manager was there and actually joined in on the locker room type of talk with his employees which was a shame . i could n't even talk to my girlfriend because they were so loud and distracting . they also were making fun of their customers and their drink choices . all in all i would not go back here after what i saw . how does a place like this that acts like it is upper crust have a staff of unprofessional people up front ? as a manager , how do you not have some rule in place that bans phones from employees while they are working ? this was amateur hour and definitely not what i expected . maybe at olive garden but even they have rules and their employees do n't pick up their phone at any chance they get . the flatbread was tasty . i wish i could have enjoyed it instead of listening to a flamboyant server talk about how drunk he got he night before .		1		0
okay so i do n't want to bring my 6 year old into a sushi restaurant . its saturday and i call for take out , thinking we 've done ra and sushi 101 so lets try bombers . we brought home sashimi , tataki and sushi . its priced between ra and sushi 101 but both my husband and i thought it was meh at best , blech at worst . maybe its a better experience if you 're there and drinking , but we were not impressed . its not impeccable fish , its just okay .		1		0
ok ... i am into dive bars . this place is not a dive bar , it is just plain filth . i never felt so disgusting in a drinking establishment in my life . my drink was horrible and my partner in crime was getting hit on by some nasty guy with sores on his face . people were playing beer pong on a ping pong table ... which then made me feel like i was 16 years old . i am actually embarassed for this place .		1		0
the buzz of the microwave , the rude service , the pretentious cash only policy at a restaurant with 15.00 entrees , lots of syscofood product cans in eye view , the food here realy sucks , but if your lucky enough to get a kitchen view , all you will hear is the hum and dings of the microwave ... the manager/server wen i asked him what he reccomended . . he got quite coindescending with me . . `` never ask that question , they wil just push what is getting old '' what a complete douschbag . . i dined here 3 months ago . . saw this review , and had to speak my peace ...		1		0
horrible experience . i arrived on a wednesday night about 5 minutes before the movie was to start . once seated in a cheap office chair , i placed an order for a diet soda and chips and salsa . the food was pouring out all movie . right next to me in fact . i had the displeasure in ending up in the seat next to where the servers stage their food delivery . nothing like a metal tray of food set up next to you every 10 minutes . so having never been here , i had no idea how long things take . finally after 35 minutes , i mention to a server that i was yet to receive my drink or food . 10 minutes later i get a watered down diet pepsi with about 4 ice cubes in it . i also was assured my chips and salsa were coming right out . 15 minutes pass and still no food . i flagged down a lovely girl who was handling checks . i informed her that after over an hour i no longer cared to get the chips i asked for . i was hungry , especially after an hour of food deliveries . but at this point , who needs $ 5 chips and salsa . after paying for me flat , oft delayed soda and exiting the theater , i voiced my displeasure with the manager . having once worked at the movies as a manager , i expected more than just a `` sorry . '' needless to say , this was my first and last visit to this theater .		1		0
we work out late , usually from 8:30 pm to 10 pm ... almost everytime , they start mopping & vacuuming the gym during this time , & i 'm getting really sick of it ! the ammonia of the mop always seems very strong & it bothers my contact lenses , plus it makes the gym very muggy . ca n't they wait til closing to mop ?? i hate when i 'm doing a set & they 're mopping or vacuuming all around me ... i have to play `` dodge the mop '' game everytime i work out . i like this gym , but not when they 're doing this . : -lrb-		1		0
i felt as if i was eating at a hospital cafeteria . the food was cold with no flavor . everything was terrible - i read the above reviews and was surprised . the room is loud and crowded . the dinner service was just like denny 's . the price is debatable - too high for third rate awful food . did i miss something ? i asked for recomendations ... i ordered the dish my server said was very good . i had their chicken schnitzel , no flavor , their potatoes , no flavor and the awful salad , a bowl of coleslaw - brown and vinagary . for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning ! i do n't serve ice cold food . their prices , for you get , are outrageous , it really was cafeteria quality or airplane ... ...		1		0
we will try again in the future but essentially `` only '' set back $ 60 for a pitcher of margaritas and a round of drinks for two . of course we ordered eats but food never arrived ! a bit surprised there was not a tequila menu ; although we luckily did n't drown our sorrows , nor our wallets , waiting on the food . unfortunately just wasted our time ... waiting and waiting .		1		0
the entrance was confusing . when you walk in its like a deli and to the back is the restaurant . the employees look at you like you are an idiot and then finally they break down and point to the back where the restaurant is . the hostess station had 3 or 4 people standing around and one extremely rude girl that took charge . we asked how long the wait was it was a long time but she said you can go to the back patio and possibly get a seat . we had never been there before so we asked is there a table available ? the rude girls response was `` we dont know '' since its first come we dont keep track of it for you . you will have to see if there is one available . we walked through and obviously there was no open table which the dumb b already knew . really bad vibe from this place . really rude staff . staff seems ultimately annoyed that you had the audacity to walk in and expect to eat there . it was almost like `` is this really happening right now ? '' that was our first and last visit we walked out after the hostess was a big b and i was completely bummed because the restaurant is beautiful . i have wanted to try it for a few years now but i cant put up with that kind of treatment . the management here must be the absolute worst otherwise there wouldnt be so many hateful people working here .		1		0
i seriously do n't know how this place rates a three star average . just like many other reviewers , i really wanted to like this place . the concept is great ! but that 's it , it 's just a concept . the food is as sterile as the environment . the only thing that distinguishes one dish from the other is the texture ... each item has the same bland taste . and as i am somewhat of a foodie , the thing that is most amazing is that i know you have to work to make food this blah . the ingredients seem fresh , they seem to have herbies and such to make them look good , but everything tastes like they boiled it until all the flavor was released , removed the food and tossed the good flavored broth . i suppose if one of your favorite food combinations is mayonaise on white bread you might be impressed , but imho save your money and take yourself anywhere else . : -rrb-		1		0

we decided to try vitos the other nite based on reviews and word of mouth so i went to there web site to check out the menu i noticed they delivered and it was 15 % off for first delivery ... perfect , so i ordered on line with a delivery time noted as we got close to the delivery time i called to let them know that there was a gate code to get in she said i will call the driver to let him know ... perferct , so came the delivery time ... plus 10 minutes ... ... plus 10 more minutes ... . . plus 10 more minutes ... . so i called back to find out where the order was ... she said oh were sorry we thought it was for pick up ... what the hell so i ca n't tell you how the food is because we never got any . ended up going else where . a return phone call from mngt or owner might have been nice .		1		0
came here the other night for happy hour . our waiter was horrible . he indirectly and directly gave us attitude . after he picked up all the finished dishes . it took him about 20 minutes to come back to our table . it was n't even busy ! then he ask how we wanted our bills to be and from his tone we knew he did n't want to split it accordingly in partners . so we asked for the bill together . i believe we had such bad service because his tip was already added to our bill -lrb- gratuity -rrb- by the way , he 's the bald guy around his late 20s . food was great ! but serviced was so bad .		1		0
went back today as i feel every place deserves a second chance . i was again irritated that the smallest sub i could order was an 8 '' . also i verified on the vito there is no mention of mayo on the menu , it states it is served with italian vinaigrette . i made sure to mention it to the girl behind the counter and she told me they put mayo on all their subs . i will not be back .		1		0
i am going to keep this short and not so sweet . first there was n't 5 guys , there was 3 guys and a girl . ok my attempt at humor might have failed but so did this place in my book . i spent 15 dollars on 2 burgers and 1 regular fry , way to much if you ask me . they screwed up my order , twice . the first time i ordered a bacon burger with cheese all the free toppings minus the mushrooms , they put mushrooms on . i sent it back and also asked them to leave off the gross , processed slop that they were trying to pass off as cheese . also the first burger was a sloppy , soggy mess from the moment i opened the foil that it was wrapped in . when i went back to the counter i went over my order , slowly , thinking it would be right . since everyone had already eaten i took it to go without checking it , another mistake on my part . they left off the mushrooms this time but forgot the bacon . you think they would have given my burger special attention since they screwed it up the first time , nope . i try to stay away from chain restaurants anyway , give my money to locally owned establishments , and this experience has solidified that notion . i will stick with lobby 's thank you .		1		0
if i could turn back time and not have gone to la petite france bistro ... i would . it was terrible . from the slow service to the iced tea that was n't ice tea ... and the waiter not even noticing no one at our table drank it ... to the sick feeling i had after the meal : -lrb- the smoked salmon crepes were not edible . they were salty and sickly fishy . we hid them under the blob of lettuce they call a salad . we also got their version of a pizza ... it was at least palatable ... but not worth bringing the left overs home . also , we had a quiche lorraine . i felt like i was eating hospital food . again , we could eat it but it was n't very good . we wanted dessert ... but i was scared to try anything further . we had just had two great crepe experiences while traveling in san fran and were looking forward to this . i 'm sorry to write this review as i think it is a individual owner trying to make a go of things ... but i think this place needs to revamp before it becomes a casuality . i only think it is fair to warn others so no one else wastes time , money and calories on this joint .		1		0

horrible . i have come here three times and each experience got progressively worse . the first time i came based on the positive reviews . i ordered 3 rolls . service was . . odd . they brought out 1 roll at a time . in the meantime , i was starving like crazy and quite annoyed that each time i finished one roll , i still sat there waiting for my next , and next . i was pretty disappointed by the rolls too -lrb- ca n't remember which i ordered -rrb- but their saving grace was the volcano roll which came last . this volcano roll has had me come back 3 more times -lrb- only take out , because i did n't feel like dealing with their service again -rrb- . the first time i took out , i ordered two volcano rolls . they were thrown together , all meshed up , never mind the presentation . sushi is all about presentation . oh well , it tasted great anyway . the second take out , my husband and i ordered the same volcano roll x 2 . my husband was n't so blown away and said , `` that was not worth $ 25.00 '' -lrb- have i mentioned that the roll is some $ 11.00 ?? i can go to a fancy sushi restaurant for that kind of price -rrb- . the rolls were sort of dry and thrown together with holes inside . i chalked it up to them not caring about their take outs . we agreed , we would n't come back ff to tonight . i was starving for sushi and i did n't want to deal with walking into the w in my pj 's , soooo . . i re-yelped dozo and let all of these positive reviews sway me . i ordered a volcano -lrb- shrimp tempura with spicy tuna -rrb- and a red dragon -lrb- crab with spicy tuna -rrb- . horrible . again , holes inside the sushi , and you would laugh if you saw how much shrimp was inside the sushi . instead , they filled with a ton of hard , dry , tempura -lrb- the breadcrumbs -rrb- . the spicy tuna was n't spicy at all . the crab -lrb- a $ 12.00 roll -rrb- was so dry and fried that the meat had turned brown . it 's like they pre-fried and then threw it in the microwave . many of the pieces would fall apart as soon as you tried to pick it up , it 's so dry . the only thing they got right this time : the presentation . i did n't even recognize the volcano roll this time - i do n't think thats what i ended up getting . $ 26.00 for two rolls after tax for pick up - i will.never.come.back and i do n't understand these reviews . i have n't posted a review in a couple of years but after poking holes into that sushi roll to remove all those rocks of tempura , it 's the first thing i did .		1		0

being from tucson , i used yelp to try and locate what is supposedly the best mexican food in the phoenix/scottsdale area . i had high hopes when i arrived at this restaurant . it is charming , and looks authentic . much like the restaurants down in tucson . the chips and salsa came out quick , and the service was great . chips and salsa were very good . however , i was disappointed that you only get one serving , and then you have to pay $ 3 for another ... something that i have never seen before . but sadly , this is was the only positive for the restaurant . i had a # 1 and the person i was eating with had flat enchiladas . if this is the best phoenix has to offer , i feel bad for anyone living here . the food lacked flavor , the green chili sauce tasted like they opened a can and poured it on top . beans and rice were not good at all . the sopapillas were good , but that is not hard to mess up . also way overpriced for what you get . do yourself a favor , and find another restaurant . not worth your time .		1		0
so i guess if i enjoyed live music and dj 's more -lrb- my man works with things like this for a living , so you could say i 'm burnt out -rrb- , i may have been able to disregard how godawful half the place smells . it 's like a big urinal punch to the nose , and it sucks , big time . the bartenders are sometimes repulsive but always more repulsed by your presence without cause . it 's almost like how emerald lounge was , but at least there , you kinda really did feel that you may not be worthy . this place just sucks . and who the hell 's idea was it to carpet a bar ? seriously .		1		0

first of all , this has nothing to do with tapino 's food or service . it may be great . in fact , that 's what we were hoping . secondly , we are big fans of what chef porter is trying to do . we have great respect for them advocating the locavore movement & using local farms & vendors . we 're huge fans of local farmers markets & buy all our produce there . we 're also huge fans of local independent restaurants & business and patronize them as much as possible . so the birthday fail begins ... one more thing . birthdays in my family are a big deal . food is a big deal . we all grew up working in my dad 's restaurant -lrb- the glass door -rrb- & food is hugely important to us . for birthdays , we do a fancy dinner & a family dinner . this was a family dinner . lots of thought goes into choosing the place for each occasion . this was also my wife 's birthday . kind of a big deal for me . for family dinner , we all go so we need a place that is n't too hard on the budget & that suits different dietary needs -lrb- some vegetarians , some food allergies -rrb- . looked at a ton of places & figured that we should try tapino as they had a great food/drink special & we were into what they are doing . figured it would be a gateway meal to us coming back a great deal more . ok , very last thing , kids ... so we brought our kids . we 've brought our kids out to eat since they were born & they know & appreciate good food . they 've been places like sea saw , nobu , bouchon , etc. . they know how to behave & are always expected to behave . so to the story ... called tapino yesterday & spoke to the manager & asked if they could take a party of 12 for happy hour . she said they normally do n't take reservations for happy hour but would be ready for us . asked if they had 2 high chairs for the kids . she said no but they had low chairs & low tables on the patio that would work great . so we 're in good shape , right ? well today , i walk in myself -lrb- without kids -rrb- & say that we are here for the party of 12 w/kids . the hostess said no kids allowed in bar nor on patio -lrb- as they allow smoking on the patio -rrb- & they do n't serve happy hour in the restaurant & just lets it sit at that . pretty weird . was almost as if they 'd were ready for us . ok , so if you do n't want kids in your place ... at least tell us . i dragged 12 people out & set their expectations & was excited to have the perfect place to celebrate my wife 's birthday . then we get there & you say sorry , nope ? also , there was n't a single person in the restaurant at this time . it was about 5:45 . not one . i 'm like in shock so i tell her i spoke with someone yesterday & she understood our situation & that we were coming in . she said that she was right there when i spoke with her manager & they do n't allow kids in the bar or on the patio & they do n't do happy hour in the resturant . ok , i get it . probably heard this 7 times when i was there . might as well have said go away , leave , we do n't want you here . she eventually said that the manager was there & she 'd have her come talk with me . during the wait , i asked about last night 's locavore dinner & told her we were excited to be there as we 'd been following them on chowhound & the phoenix hound gathering group . also told her i 'd been talking with one of the farmers that was in for the previous night 's event . basically i let her know we know what they did & were into it . might have factored in a bit ? nope . eventually , the manager came out & they chatted . the manager then came over & changed the story & said we could sit in the bar at a couple of benches but kept reiterating that the kids could n't make any noise nor move around at all . ok , fine . first of all , we expect the kids to behave . if she 'd left it with one mention , maybe we 'd have just sat down . but with repeated mentions of no noise , no moving around , it was obvious they did n't want us there . i told her i felt that way & she said that was n't the case but it rang quite hollow . i went outside to talk with the family & figured we 'd probably go elsewhere as we really were n't wanted . went in to tell the hostess -lrb- manager was nowhere around -rrb- & got a perfunctory sorry . just seems like such a customer service failure . if they 'd wanted us there , they could have refrained from making us feel unwelcome . or if they were uncomfortable with kids being in the bar or on the patio , they could have easily set us up in the empty restaurant & offered us the same food/drink . or they could have told us their mantra `` no kids in the bar or on the patio , no happy hour in the restaurant '' on the phone . maybe it was a bad situation for them but if it were me , i would have tried a little bit harder to find a solution that would n't have so alienated us . i do n't know . i 'm epxecting to see chef porter at otfm & am friends with people who work with him & maybe we 'll come back -lrb- sans kids of course -rrb- but right now it sure does n't feel like it & it 's a major bummer as tapino seems like a place that is doing excactly what we love & we could have been huge fans .		1		0

before i jump into this review , let me just preface it by saying that i 'm really not a fan of chain restaurants -lrb- chipotle , jersey mike 's and yogurtland excluded -rrb- . and in my opinion , the cheesecake factory embodies everything i hate about chain restaurants . right off the bat , our server was rude and disinterested . and every time he visited the table next to us , he stood between their table and ours , with his behind right in our faces . he was incredibly slow in delivering drinks -lrb- we only ordered iced tea -rrb- and only came by to refill once . i ordered the evelyn 's favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu -lrb- aside from salads -rrb- . my only request was to take off the kalamata olives . of course , when the food was delivered , it was chock-full of olives . so not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with , but the small amount of flavor that i was able to detect was ruined by the olives . i 'm not a complainer , and i hate sending food back , so i picked as many out as i could , but it was n't really worth salvaging . i mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate , took a few bites , and pushed it aside , which is disappointing since it 's a $ 13 bowl of pasta . when the bill finally arrived , it added up to just under $ 50 for two iced teas , one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad . i 'm sorry , but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food . this visit was most definitely my last visit to the cheesecake factory . and if you happen to be looking for dinner at the biltmore , i would suggest you stop anywhere else .		1		0

well ... where do i begin ... the parking lot is insane . the atmoshphere is good , open kitchen , which was fun watching the chefs . the employees were great , friendly , and knowledgeable . the food ... not so much . we started off with the chicken meat balls . had no taste , and had way too much of some herb . i had the petite chicken as my dinner . this dish as well , had no taste . it was nothing special . for $ 16.00 , i hoped it would have been amazing . will not be back . this place is just too expensive for the lack of taste it offers . on a side note . . if you bring in your own birthday cake ... they charge you $ 1.00 per slice . what !! yes boys and girls ... they charge you $ 1.00 per slice of your own birthday cake you bring in .		1		0
i agree with all the other reviewers so far . this festival was one of the most poorly planned events i have ever been to . it all started when i purchased 2 tickets via groupon for $ 10 . arriving at the event i waited about 30 min to park my car which cost me another $ 5 . once i entered the festival the lines for each truck were awful . not only that , you could n't see the menus very well to see what each truck was serving . not all of them are blatantly marked . the first line we stood in ran out of food . the next two lines we attempted did n't move ... at all . i 'm serious . i do n't know what was going on up in those food trucks , but i was n't getting any closer to eating the longer i waited . also , can i mention that you still have to pay for the food . oh yes , you pay to enter this event , and then pay to eat . after 90 minutes of waiting in lines and not eating i was hungry , frustrated , irritated , thirsty , and down right pissed off . we left . i therefore spent $ 15 for a boat-load of aggravation and ate no food at this food festival . what a complete waste of time .		1		0
i do n't know why they removed their comfortable chairs . it 's like they wanted to make it clear , `` we do n't want you to hang out here '' . got the message , i will be going somewhere else . service is very slow and they never acknowledge it . it seems the people who work there must hate their job , because they are always so moody . my hubby used to go there quite a bit , now he drives by it , to go all the way to echo . i have n't been back in a few months , and i am not planning to go back any time soon or maybe ever .		1		0
the one star is for the extremely dangerous parking garage . while exiting the underground parking , it is virtually impossible to see oncoming pedestrians due to the grade , construction and wooden signs put out to advertise the parking structure itself . it is just a matter of time before someone gets severely injured or killed . this is a huge oversight and an accident waiting to happen .		1		0
it is just astonishing to think that a town which was once part of méxico ca n't manage to come up with any decent mexican food . los olivos is all about `` sonoran style '' which is heavy and greasy , but that aside , there is nothing inventive about anything on the menu . i ordered a shredded beef tostada and they did not bother to drained the boiled meat before assembling the thing . my tostada was basically soup with overcooked beef , tasteless vegetables and a very soggy tortilla and to top it off , it was stone cold when it arrived with grease congealing . i sent it back . a replacement never arrived . the margaritas were seriously overpriced and tasted like kool-aid with something really bitter added to it but for me , that was my dinner that night . fortunately there is a sonic drive-in not too far away which saved my evening . even the chips were greasy and encrusted with so much salt that we had to use our fingers to rake it off . the salsa is just average . the decor is interesting and dalí-esque but i can get enough of a look by driving by and next time i will keep going . how this place manages to stay open is a mystery , but to be fair , scottsdale does not set the bar very high for mexican food . it 's as if all of the owners get together monthly to review their crappiness scores to make sure nobody is doing it right and making the others look bad . honestly , taco bell is a better choice . ugh !		1		0
shame on you macaroni grill ! i ordered a `` create your own pasta '' dish for take out and was horrified when i got home . my $ 14 pasta -lrb- which included chicken for an extra $ 3.50 -rrb- consisted of one small chunk of chicken the size of a nickel and approx . 15 noodles . there was virtually no sign of the sauce or veggies i had requested . what a horrible waste of money .		1		0
very disappointing . i was looking forward to a lox breakfast , but i do n't eat farmed salmon . so of course i had to ask if the lox was from farmed or wild salmon . the server checked with the kitchen and it is farmed ! no lox for me . i then asked about the chicken livers ; `` are they organic ? '' i thought the waitress was going to burst out laughing but she quickly composed herself and just lightly shook her head . okay , i 'm a fuss bucket , i just ca n't eat nitrates , hormones , preservatives , etc. . i ordered a bagel and wished i had just gone to tj and picked up some wild alaskan lox , organic eggs , organic bread , organic butter and i would have gotten it all for the price of their lox & eggs breakfast plate with plenty of quality food stuffs for 4 other meals . i think this place is past it 's due date , old school , no growth and just getting by on low grade food stock and laughing all the way to the bank .		1		0
awful !!! i was so excited today to go to genghis grill because i love diy stirfry places ; especially yc 's !!! i was so disapointed and disgusted by this place . reasons why this place did me wrong : - the try to make it too full-service restuaranty ; not quick service like i want for my short lunch break - thick , syrupy sauces full of sugar and carbs and fat as my only choice for sauces . yuck . when i eat at a mongolian stirfry place i want something fresh and healthy . news flash to people who think they are eating healthy here : you just killed it with the sauces ! - very busy and very slow to get your food - small bowls , nothing to use to compress your food to add more - also i saw someone mention how `` genghis grill does n't make you pay for your to-go boxes like yc 's '' i had to pay 9.99 for mine to-go . $ 1 more than the normal price for staying there to eat . positive : - fresher meat and more variety of proteins i will never go back		1		0
this place makes me nervous just thinking about going there . i have officially decided i am never going back here again . i will drive 15-20 miles to my nearest sprouts or the fancy fry 's in scottsdale before i ever drive 1 mile to get to safeway . it 's that bad . not only is the parking lot notoriously sketchy with inconsiderate drivers abounding , but there are numerous problems inside the store , as well : 1 -rrb- you walk in to a rather dimly-lighted store , usually with a sour-faced security guard blocking your access to the carts . 2 -rrb- what carts you ask ? that 's a good question . several times i have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock , even though i had a long grocery list to fulfill . i actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails , laughing and having a heck of a time . look , i get it , it 's hot outside and you do n't want to get get the carts , but c'mon ! 3 -rrb- the first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit , or on the 4th of july , a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table . 4 -rrb- venture into the produce section , and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through . please , managers , make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width !!! 5 -rrb- the line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area . enough said . 6 -rrb- expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day . i would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time . 7 -rrb- once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list , you must enter one of the two checkout lines , which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways . two checkout lines , you say ? yes , only two , despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes . if you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene , expect to be `` checked out '' by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line . 8 -rrb- your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done . but you are so eager to get out of there , you simply do n't care to go back and ask for it . oh , and there may or may not be trash on the floor . if safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service , they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store , and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here . it 's even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown , so they could easily be the most popular . please , downtown , replace this disgraceful store with a whole foods or a sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency .		1		0
we stopped by gilligan 's on our way to martini ranch . we were having a good time taking pictures on the swinging chair and when i tried to get off the chair my purse knocked my drink over . the bartender made me another drink for free ! i thought that was really nice and gilligin 's was cool in my book . i was having a good time until an employee accused me of puking in the bathroom . i told her i did n't puke in the bathroom and she said `` like you would tell me if you did '' i asked her if she was the puke patrol and she kicked me out . good thing she does n't have a job where she has to use her judgment because she is not the sharpest tool in the shed . she also made me hate this bar because they have nothing but idiots working here . except for the guy who gave me a free drink .		1		0
i went and i was greatly disapointed . i had a simple 14 '' mushroom , onion and cheese pizza . it was barely 4 sliced mushrooms on the entire thing ! the crust though different was not that great either . beverages are all totally overpiced . i 'm a fan of hard ciders especially hornsby 's cider . one bottle here is only .50 cheaper than a 6 pack . my simple pizza was just shy of $ 18 !! the host at the door just let me walk in and take a seat . she seated everyone else . i set for 7 minutes until my waiter came and then he got me a menu . there 's a survey you can take on your reciept that gives you $ 5 off your next visit . i wish i could just have my evening back and my money . i brought half the pizza home which was my plan to tkae it for lunch tomorrow . nope i will wreck my 30 min lunch break with this crap ! i was hoping a homeless or street person would approach me and i could give it away , but none did .		1		0
i 'm pretty angry ... i was slightly ticked after our visit last night and fully intended to give maggiano 's a 2 star update . but within the last 5 minutes i went from annoyed to pissed . let me start from the beginning ... after a very rough saturday with a beloved member of our family in the hospital , we were craving some comfort food , and we were in no mood to cook . we had a great experience at maggiano 's last time and we thought the extra meal they provide when you order a classic entree would be perfect the next day , since we knew we would be busy and emotionally drained . we get there and hear there is an hour wait . luckily we snagged a bar table and did n't have to wait . we order the overpriced drinks . they take 10 minutes to arrive . my cocktail is pretty watered down . okay . we understand busy restaurants . not mad ... yet . we order our food . the complimentary bread still has n't arrived . i thought my starving husband and kid were going to pass out . 20 minutes pass . no server . 40 minutes pass . our server approaches `` oh , would you like some bread while you wait ? '' why , yes . yes we would . another 10 minutes pass . we get our bread . our cold , stale tasting bread . luckily olive oil can save even stale bread . my famished teenager ate most of it . my husband and i both order another round . another 20 minutes pass . i got my wine but my husband never got his beer . a food runner brings out our food . no offered parmesan or anything . my husband looks around longingly for his beer . we dig into the food . my normally not picky teenage boy said `` there 's something strange about this food . ca n't put my finger on it '' . he still ate most of it of course . my husband 's rigatoni was passable . my eggplant parmesan on the other hand ... while i appreciate it being hand breaded and not like the formerly frozen discs that the olive garden serves , i was disappointed . there were three layers of eggplant . while the bottom 2 layers were warm , the top layer was room temperature . the breading itself was salty and very eggy . it tasted like the first time i attempted making eggplant parmesan as a college student . the one slice of mozzarella on top of this mess was not even melted . it had the texture of sliced processed cheese . the sauce was not good ... you know all that garlic that i loved in my previous review ? well , it was still there . but it tasted like stale garlic cloves that were barely cooked . it 's like they threw in these awful garlic cloves 5 minutes before the sauce was done cooking . they were actually chewy . we finally saw our server when she rushed over and threw our to-go entrees at us . still did n't bring the beer . a few more minutes pass and she brings the beer and apologizes for her 20 minute delay . my husband said no thanks , that he does n't want it . she says ok , walks away , then has the good sense to walk back and give it to him saying it 's on her . but do n't feel too sorry for us ... the table next to us was seated before we were . they got their food a solid 15 minutes after we did . i was n't ready to throw in the towel on maggiano 's . i just figured they had a bad night . after all , my previous visit was so awesome . well ... after another grueling and emotional day i finally decide to put some food in my belly . wow , that order of cheese raviolis from maggiano 's sounds pretty good right now . i reach into their fancy to-go paper bag and pull out the entrees . 2 meat lasagnas . one sausage rigatoni . zero cheese raviolis . i really am ready to call them and scream at them ... but it 's after 10pm on a sunday . if i were n't a life long vegetarian i would be tearing into those other entrees . but i 'm not . which is why i ordered cheese ravioli . no worries . i scanned my near empty refrigerator and pantry . found some ramen noodles and frozen costco raviolis . score ! i 'm sure the costco ravioli tastes better than their crappy ravioli any day . : -lrb-		1		0
trash . trash . trash . this bar is a complete waste of time . the only time i will go there now is if a friend is playing there . every time i have gone it is like our generations excuse to be completely uninhibited , disgusting and irresponsible . not to mention if you want a free show of someone blowing someone else , screwing , fighting or snorting things this is the place to be .		1		0
i was so proud of myself for finally getting around to cashing in the $ 5 coupon i received for running the 10k turkey trot last thanksgiving , which mi amigo 's sponsors , and i got ta tell ya , i really , really wish i had n't . bad food , worse service . the waitress was hot , though . rude , but hot . i ordered the shrimp & scallop enchiladas , which basically consisted of a couple stale tortillas covered with runny cheese , topped off with half a dozen miniature shrimps and scallops . oh , and a small pile of cold beans and white -lrb- white , really ? -rrb- rice . my date actually grimaced when they brought out the food - grimaced ! - and said , `` you 're not really going to eat that , are you ? '' we were in a drinking mood and surely would have spent good money doing it , but after she brought the food , we never saw the hot waitress again - ever ! - and i actually had to get up and ask another , much less attractive waitress for the bill . here 's the best part - they took my $ 5 coupon but did n't apply it to the bill . a-holes .		1		0
if you like to overpay for watered down coffee , service with an attitude , & get stale pastry with flies flying inside the bakery case than this is the place for you ! btw : there is a 50 cent charge to use your credit/debit card to pay for your coffee here -lrb- wtf ! -rrb- i hate to write a negative review for a place that use to be an old neighborhood favorite . but if your loyal customers just stop showing up & never criticize your performance you can ' t fix it ! so here 's my father 's words of wisdom that you wo n't get in any business school : `` people go where they are invited , they stay where they feel welcomed ! '' hava java stopped inviting & welcoming customers when it started putting offensive signs on the bathroom door , and then password protecting its free wifi service with passwords like buy coffee ! it seems that hava java lost the hunger to be a superior establishment by having better tasting products at a competitive price , and giving their customers a better experience than their competitors ! hava java use to be a great place to hang out or for a cup of coffee in the arcadia/camelback area , but it seems in the past couple of years the place has consistently slipped and it is sharing the faith of another once upon a time great coffee hang out at the biltmore area , the coffee plantation !		1		0
if you enjoy salt and lousy service then this is the spot for you . honestly , i 'm not sure why people are so hype about this place . yes the salsa is spicy but really has no taste to it . it 's like spicy water . everybody in our party of 7 did not even eat a quarter of their meal . the machaca that i had must have been marinated , aged and cooked in salt using a rock salt oven and to make matters worse the servers were no where to be found to refill our refreshments as our mouth dried like cured hides . this place should have been called los `` sal '' molinos and should have stayed a funeral home and use the large amount of salt they use for embalmment . currently competing with morton for the # 1 spot as salt distributor in the south west region .		1		0

i tried this place twice before the remodel and the food was not good . i tried the bar twice after the remodel because of the atmosphere potential and the service was lame with no mexican beer on tap . there is also a creepy-ness factor with this place , something is not quite right at this business . i ca n't quite put my finger on it but its definitely there . i wo n't be going back . two good mexican food places within walking distance of this place anyway .		1		0
i would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the rainforest cafe again . i would rather eat ... ... at the worst applebee 's in america ... vending machine food ... my own flesh now , rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk . then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies . i would have rather had totino 's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared . the plant and animal filled space could really use the services of merry maids . really . how do you clean all that crap ? the rainforest `` thunderstorm '' is as exciting as the one in the produce section at safeway . so if you have kids who like to drink , you might have a good time here . otherwise i say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan .		1		0
5 star location and view . 1 star service . 2 star food quality . 1 star atmosphere . outside of the outstanding view and patio , i 'm having a hard time finding much positive to say about this place . service sucked . for a restaurant in this price range i 'd give it negative 3 stars . waiter was extremely inattentive . we ended up getting more -lrb- & better -rrb- service from a different waiter . not really sure what our waiter was doing all night since we dined late and the restaurant was nearly empty . our original waiter waited 30 to 45 minutes after we ordered to let us know that the kitchen was out of some items we ordered . this is 100 % inexcusable for a restaurant in this price range . food flavor ranged from bland to unimpressively odd . the preparation of individual items and dish combinations were overreaching , unappetizing and spectacularly disappointing . desserts where completely underwhelming and generic in options and taste . to add insult to injury , we were seated right next to a drunk party of 6 -lrb- the restaurant was nearly empty -rrb- who spent the entire night obnoxiously yelling over each other , constantly using vulgar language . it was extremely difficult to hear the person directly across the table from me speak . again , for a restaurant in this price range , this is 100 % unacceptable . i 'd be hard pressed to return to this restaurant even if it had tgifriday 's prices . considering the prices , i prefer to give this place negative 2 stars . i 'll have to settle for 1 . if you want to enjoy the view , simply stop by for drinks . if you want a great meal and service , save your money for someplace like blt or rancho pinot .		1		0
dont waist your time ! we got here at 6:30 on sat night for a friends birthday . when we sat down we ordered a beer each and everyone wanted to do a shot so we all did one . we at that point we ordered chips and queso dip . 45 min later we ask about the queso and the waitress said she will check on it . she comes back out the kitchen and says they are making it now . wtf this is chips from a bag and some cheese dip the put in a microwave . unreal . 10 min later our chips and queso show up . everytime we ordered a beer it took 15-20 min to get . no joke . its because they have one person bartending on a saturday night . not sure why , but the place was only about a third full but she was backed up and the manager was not helping . at about 8:30 a few more people show up and we got another shot and now my third beer in two hours . when the waitress brings the drinks she tells us the manager says we cant order anymore drinks for 30 45 min . i said why not . she says the manager says we cant serve you anymore shots cause there is a limit to how much we can serve you in a certain amount of time . i said you have got to be kiddding me . on my third beer and two little girl foo foo shots and we are cut off , one hour for queso dip , you are f $ #kin kidding me . i said check please we are out of here . we were not being loud or causing in attention to us for any reason . it was the most melow i have seen a grpup of 10 be at a bar . a few people went outside to smoke every once in a while and each end of the table had there own conversation going on.the worst service , i have never seen this before . i have been drinkin at the bars for a while and i have to say 3 12oz bottel beers and 2 shots in 2 and a half hours on a sat night is a slow start at the bar . this place is horrible . if i could give them 0 stars or negative stars i would ! im sorry i guess im the only one going to the bar on a sat night to get a littel drunk .		1		0
i have not left a dining establishment as upset as i was when i left pearl . the experience i had as absolutely horrible . i am not one to make a big deal about nothing and i , more often than not , give people the benefit of the doubt , but i can honestly say i was shocked and extremely furious after my visit . i bought a localdines certificate to go to pearl and have been dying to try the place out . they have a great menu and it is in a fun location . the terms on the localdine clearly state that it is only valid mon-thurs . we went on tuesday at 7pm , sat down , i pulled out the coupon and was promptly told by the bartender `` we dont accept those on tuesdays '' then he walked off . let me also clarify that while it was 7pm it was not crowded or busy . there was no one else sitting at the bar with us . i waited for him to come back so i could show him that it clearly says on there that it is valid only mon-thurs . he then notified me that it was in fact not valid on tues or thurs because they have specials . i explained to him that we drove more than 30 minutes to get there and we could order off the main menu and not get any of the specials if that would be ok ... he said it was out of his hands and he couldnt do anything and walked off . a female server chimed in that `` there 's nothing we can do to help you , its just how it is '' then she also just walked away . are you kidding me ?? not a single person was willing to talk to us and explain things or give us 2 minutes of their time . the customer service was absolutely ridiculous . i have never been treated so rudely in a situation that i clearly had a right for clarification . today 10/5/2011 i see that localdines is featuring pearl with the same coupon that clearly states valid only mon-thurs . needless to say , i am making it a point to write a very appropriately rude review about this place . the menu looks amazing , many people have written reviews about the great food ... i however , never had a chance to try the food because i couldnt get past the servers who made us feel like we were n't worth their time . save yourself the snotty scottsdale attitude and go to ra , stingray , sapporo or sushi brokers ... they will not only serve you good sushi , they will also be polite .		1		0
groupon brought me to this joint ... and been here several times over the past few months . we went there tonight for dinner and * bam * , there was a notice on the door that the place was being repossessed by the property owner . it 's closed . another victim of groupon ... so many deals on groupon are from restaurants that go under . this is one of many recent joints to go bye bye ... return factor - an obvious 0 %		1		0
we just moved back into the hood from anthem and man what a bummer this safeway is . i love love lve lve lev love loooove safeway . i will drive any distance to shop at a safeway - what a bummer this is only 1/2 a mile from my house . went last night and was utterly appalled at the mess of a store i walked into . the aisles were a disaster - product was thrown everywhere or was completely out . i thought this was a grocery store ? a place to buy food ? one checkout line open and a miserable employee ringing . if i was n't in the middle of baking dessert at home i would have tossed the ingredients i needed back on the shelves and gotten the hell outta there . thank god the safeway on osborn is only a short ride away .		1		0
most of the sushi is good , but today i was very disappointed with the service and the food . our waitress was very inattentive , but i left that slip because it was somewhat busy and she seemed to be the only one working the tables . but what really got me was that our lobster roll came out covered in massive amounts of mayo . i took a bite and my hubby took a bite and literally felt sick from the amount of mayo . the waitress never came back to ask us how our meal was and when she came back to clear the table she asked if we wanted a box . i explained that the roll was not edible , she said `` yeah it does look like a lot of mayo . '' and took it away . she did not ask to replace it or discount our bill . when the bill came , we were charged for the roll . i decided to take that out of her tip . bottom line , its a hit and miss with the service and the food .		1		0

the service was lousy . our waitress did n't bring out our drinks for 20 minutes and we had to flag her down just to get those drinks . we were essentially ignored the entire night as she never checked up on us , or refilled our drinks and the restaurant was not busy so there was no excuse for her lousy service . we had to flag her down again just to get our bill . the restaurant was n't busy which was strange because this was right before an event . the food was n't bad but it was n't good . it had no flavor . if you are seeking simple bar food , i would recommend jacksons on third and cooperstown over this place . i would even recommend the matador restaurant next door . we wo n't be coming back and i do n't recommend this place		1		0

i do n't like to give places a 1 star review unless i have either gotten sick or had a really bad experience . i sort of had a combination of the two at china magic noodle house . i saw a groupon for this restaurant a couple days ago and it looked simple and good so i went ahead and bought it . i am always in the mood for noodles so i was excited to try this place , and it was right down the street from my house . so sunday afternoon we decided to eat here for lunch . i have been sitting on this experience for two days now and i feel that i am not giving a harsh review based on my experience . we walk in around 3pm and there were only a few tables being served . the first thing that hits me is the smell of this place . my first thought was that it smelled like urine . i 'm sure it was just a combination of the spices and whatever was being made in the kitchen , but it was not a mouth watering smell like you should experience when you walk into a restaurant . i should have turned right around and went home , but we stayed . so we sit down and someone brings over some water and some boiled peanuts and pickled vegetables . i still am not sure if this was supposed to be some kind of appetizer or a garnish for the noodles . it was a little weird . so i decided on the spicy vegetarian noodle dish , and my husband decides on the vegetables and fried noodle dish and a strawberry smoothie . i see that there are spring rolls on the menu as well . there is a language barrier here with the waiters so when i asked if the spring rolls were vegetarian at first she just thought i was ordering them , but after asking three times whether or not they were vegetarian i think she finally understood what i was asking . so i was a little bit concerned about these . everything came out really fast . like around 5 minutes fast . the spring rolls were vegetarian , but they tasted like they came out of a freezer bag . and the vegetables inside were really limp and not crisp at all . a couple packets of mustard and some gelatin like duck sauce come with the rolls . i did n't use either . how hard would it be to make a really simple nice sauce for the rolls ? my noodles come out first and at first they look really good and i was excited . however as i am eating them i am noticing some weird textures in the supposedly vegetarian sauce . it tasted almost like some kind of seafood and it was gritty . i did n't finish it and when i asked two different waitresses what was in the sauce , neither of them could tell me . which is concerning . i ca n't feel good going back to a place that ca n't tell me whats in the vegetarian sauce . my husband liked his noodles , but he is n't as paranoid about what his food is made out of as i am . his smoothie tasted like a slushie you get at 7-11 . i am sure it was made with some kind of red dye and not fresh strawberries . sickeningly sweet as well . about an hour later we are walking around target and my stomach starts to burn . i feel this intense burning sensation in my stomach for the next two days . i think there is some kind of issue with msg here possibly . i do n't know what else could have made me feel like that . i also did n't eat pretty much anything for the next two days because of how bad my stomach felt . the only cool thing about this place is the guy who pulls noodles in the big window in the middle of the restaurant . prices are also pretty cheap . its cash preferred as well . other than that , i am sorry to say i wo n't be back .		1		0
sometimes in life you win . sometimes you loose . today i lost ! reluctant to go in , shady strip mall , uninviting exterior . but asked a few people coming out if the food was any good and they said `` excellent '' `` been eating here for 10 years . '' so , we thought sure , that is a great endorsement from strangers . what were they smoking ? walked into a empty restaurant at noon , only to find a very modern decor , and thought ok it is clean and i like the stainless steel table tops . and that is when what i liked came to an end : started with the most boring lukewarm soup in the world , the wonton noodle soup , bland is the motto here . and i like my soup hot by the way , wtf ? next came the lunch not-so-specials : 1 -rrb- wife : had the sweet and sour special , boring . but worst of all , it appeared undercooked so we told the very nice lady and she assured us that it is cooked twice , once before customer orders and once after , and again i say wtf ? that does n't sound good . they brought her a new order , but wife insists the chickens had a strange mcnugget texture to it . 2 -rrb- me : the bland and uninspiring house special chicken , bland , boring fried rice , no carrots or peas or egg in it just boring fried rice . and the egg roll is a spring roll , and i hate spring rolls . my chicken was cooked , but it was n't very good . drowned in garlic and some dull brown sauce . and the worst of all : the bill -lrb- for lunch brau -rrb- . $ 27.99 -lrb- before tip -rrb- for 2 teas , 2 not-so-lunch-specials , and the worst soup known to man . shame actually , if they put as much effort into their dull food as they do the interior then it could be good . wo n't be back . rule of thumb , if a restaurant is empty at prime lunch hour , it is for a reason .		1		0
ruined our anniversary . reservation was made 30 days in advance ! the chef acted like he was too good to spend time looking for our name . simply looked at the book and said , no that name is not here . warning : do n't go here for any type of occasion or you might end up stuck with no dinner that night . luckily roaring fork came through with an amazing meal as always .		1		0
do you ever think that you 're on punk 'd ? or on that abc show `` what would you do with john quinones '' ? i was hoping to g-o-d me and my in-laws were on that show . that would have explained why our experience at sylvia 's was so horrific . i was silently praying that a pseudo celebrity or the `` great john q. '' himself would come out of the kitchen with several cameras and a boom mic to get our surprised reaction to the awful food and the restaurant 's terrible manager . well , that did n't happen . so , let me tell you what did . my wife , her family and i went to sylvia 's for dinner on wednesday night . it was about 8:30 when we rolled into the parking lot . the restaurant closes at 10pm . `` we 're good , '' we thought . we hate being those people who come in half an hour before close . we walk in to the restaurant and approach the hostess who also became our waitress for the evening . `` five , please , '' we tell her . she looks at us like she does n't know what to do . the restaurant looks empty . we think there should n't be a problem for seating . but she says to us , `` we do n't have any tables for your party , i 'll be right back . '' she runs into the kitchen and returns a few minutes later . she says she can seat us in the bar area . hmmm . we took that as `` oh , we 've already cleaned the restaurant area . we 'll put you in the bar so we do n't have to clean that part again . '' we follow her lead and she honestly seats us in the dark . the bar is so dark . it 's so cold and the music is so loud . at this point , my brother-in-law says , `` i do n't want to eat here anymore , can we go ? '' we try to make the best of the cold , dark , loud bar , but after a few minutes we ca n't take it anymore . i took it upon myself to ask the waitress if we could be re-seated in the dining area . she looked very shocked at the request . i told her the bar area was just way too cold . she smiles and says to me , `` that 's fine . just pick a table '' . her telling us that there were n't any tables for us in the dining room initially was way wrong , because we found one just fine . we re-seat ourselves and she comes back and gets our drink orders and brings some chips . honestly , she was nice . she had good customer service skills and was very polite . i thought this would be the turn of our evening for a good night . no . she brings out the flour chips and they were a-w-f-u-l . my mother-in-law , who is really easy going by the way , said it tasted like it was fried in `` rancid oil '' . after tasting it , i was inclined to agree . we thought , `` well , it is the end of the day . maybe these are just the chips that were n't eaten during the day . '' we get over it . a few minutes later , our waitress comes back and takes our order . it 's about 8:45 at this point . the family orders mexican food and i ordered their green chili burger . pretty simple stuff right ? wrong . half an hour later . my wife gets her food brought out to her . my mother and father-in-law get theirs . then , my brother-in-law . `` oh , i 'm sorry ! your burger will be out in two minutes , '' said the waitress . `` gee , that sucks , '' i think to myself . `` it 's only two minutes . '' `` that 's fine , '' i said to the waitress . i look over at my wife 's food and she says i could have some . i take a bite of the rice and i almost threw up in my mouth . the rice tasted like it was cooked in bleach . i grabbed my napkin and spit it out . my wife and mother-in-law look at me as if i 'm crazy . `` that 's disgusting , '' i said to them . they both tasted it . they looked like they were going to puke too . my mom-in-law suggested that we tell the waitress the rice was horrible , but my wife said `` let 's wait until he gets his burger . '' i 'm sitting at the table . i 'm watching my family eat their food . i look at the clock on the wall above the kitchen . 2 minutes goes by . then 10 . then 20 . during that entire time , the waitress was a no-show . she did n't come to say `` you 're food is coming right up . i 'm sorry about this . '' nothing . instead , i got to see everyone eat . they all said their food was `` alright '' , but have had it better here before . at 25 minutes after the woman said 2 minutes , i see her coming to the table with my burger . she apologized . at this point , it 's not even worth eating . i tell her that everyone in my party has already eaten their food . this was out almost half-an-hour later than she said it would be . i told her i do n't think we should pay for this . she said , you 're right . would you like me to get a box for you ? still hungry . i said yes . then comes the manager . he walks to us like he wants to pick a fight . he stops in front of our table and i 'm waiting for him to say he 's sorry about the service and that it 's not reflective of what they normally are like . no . he 's pissed . he 's mad that i 'm taking the burger and not paying for it . i call him out and say they have terrible service . my mom-in-law chimes in and said everything was horrible . he ignores us , walks away and the burger was comped . i will never be back .		1		0
awesome little neighborhood bar ... live entertainment nightly ... -lrb- i 'd bet most would love this cozy little place -rrb- ... `` nice '' jazz and `` nice '' -lrb- euro -rrb- food ... but i 've had the absolute worst service and consistently !!! ... : -lrb-		1		0
really people ? maybe the meat dishes here are good . that 's the only way i can understand why this place has such a large customer base . initially , i was excited to see a vegetarian section on their menu with about 6 items on it . we got one dish with tofu & vegetables , and another dish with vermicelli and fake pork . the tofu dish tasted like it was cooked in fish sauce , and aside from it not being truly `` vegetarian , '' the tofu was awful and the wheat gluten meat is something you can buy in a can . the other noodle dish was so bland that we had to add four different sauces to it , just to give it some kind of flavor . i will give them props for being cheap ... but we definitely will not be returning here . oh , and their parking lot reeked of trash-juice-smell .		1		0
wow . we must have went on a bad day or something . burnt popcorn , tasteless food in super super tiny portions . majorly bummed on this place . we drove 40 miles to try it . waste of gas . guess thats what we get for going on a weekday afternoon . we did like our server though .		1		0
i ca n't stand this place . yet another yogurt company capitalizing on the froyo craze of 2008 and this one is terribly executed . most of the places operate in a normal order-person fills order-pay-eat format . not mojo . they , for whatever reason , want to be different . this means it is self-service almost the whole way through . you wait in line for a machine that puts out the flavor of yogurt you want . then when you get there , it is usually blinking and telling you that you have to wait for it to freeze up . once you get a decent amount of yogurt , it usually tells you that you have to wait again because it has to refreeze . 10 minutes later , you have filled a cup comparably to what you usually get at a full service yogurt place . you then are given the ability to top it off with a tray of condiments similar to the breakfast bar at holiday inn . of course , you have no idea where those spoons have been and can almost guarantee that some 5 year old licked his yogurt , then stuck the spoon in it as he was pouring too many m & m s on his frozen treat . so you top off your yogurt in a manner similar to what you would find elsewhere and move to the next station . you have no reached the end where you finally interact with a human . this person then weighs your creation -lrb- mind you it is the exact same as one you would get at a full service yogurt place -rrb- and then he tells you that it will be $ 15 . i 'm sorry what ? $ 15 for yogurt . this size is $ 5 at every other yogurt place and you want three times that ? when i did all of the work ? oh no . these places are such a ripoff . it costs them $ 0.08 per ounce of this stuff . unless you are covering it with caviar , macadamia nuts , and gold leaves - it is n't worth what they charge .		1		0
no . do n't go . i thought it was a great concept but their implementation of the mexican/asian idea was far from meeting any kind of expectations . i wanted to be able to come in and look at a menu and order easily and quickly . instead , the girl said not to look at their menu up on the wall because it was n't the real one . huh ???? instead we should look at this laminated picture thingy she held out to us that explained the various plates and sides , etc. and told us we needed to sample each little dish before deciding . i had no time to do any such silly thing ! i lost my patience so i just ordered a quesadilla and then sat down to wait for eric to finish his order . he ordered some weird combo dish for himself that actually was n't too bad . the place itself was a little strange . it was almost as though they had very first opened their doors hastily without finishing the details ... the `` fake '' misleading menu , for one ; and the lack of decor , for two . a few objects here and there suggested it was a mix of hispanic and asian , but it just felt empty and had no character or enthusiasm . especially in the folks taking orders .		1		0
this place has been around for as long as i can remember and it has always sucked . earlier today , i had a conversation with one of my best friends about buffalo exchange and he went off on a stand-up comedy rant about it that had me and my girlfriend rolling on the floor as we listened on speakerphone . he was saying things like `` buffalo exchange ? what 's the ` exchange ' part ? i exchange an hour of my time for elvira 's dirty looks at my clothes ? '' i made him start a yelp account just so he could review this place . i really hope he does - and other places as well . anyway , i do n't want to tread his material , so i 'll keep this short ... there 's something demoralizing about bringing your clothes in to buffalo exchange . they rarely take anything citing that it 's not in style or season or whatever , and then you look around and the only stuff they have is more out of style than the shit you 're trying to sell them . then you look at the person criticizing your clothes and it 's some fashion disaster from the mid-90s . when they do take your 130 dollar jeans , they only give you like 4 bucks . they are complete assholes . i 've been to other locations - same story ... with one exception - long beach . the long beach location rocks ... well , have n't tried selling - but typically have a great selection to buy . just stay away from tempe buffalo exchange - the sooner that place gets torn down and turned into modern urban condos the better ... i would like to see siouxie sue get a real job somewhere - i can just see her at starbucks looking down her nose at her customers for ordering the wrong coffee .		1		0

was with a group of 9 , slow service ... it was croweded and the waitress hardly saw our table . people just ordered mutlipe drinks at a time anticipating slow service . ordered the most expensive thing on the menu , the rib-eye . worst piece of meat i 've ever had . one half was cooked rare , the other half was medium ... with more fat on it then meat . waitress asked me to be honest about how it was and i said ok , and that was the end of it ... thanks . never again .		1		0
guess what ? i just got back from mexico . and it only it took me 5 minutes to get there ! everytime i have to go to this wal-mart , no less than 10 day-laborers run out to my truck , waving their arms as if just because i drive a truck means i 'm looking for workers . ugh ... and the store itself ... it 's so sad looking . the parking lot is littered with plastic bags , cups , just garbage in general . and even at it 's busiest , they absolutely refuse to open more than 2 registers . does n't matter if the lines are 50 customers deep ... sorry , only 2 registers open . the shelves are a mess , nothing lines up to the correct price . so that coffee maker you thought was 25 bucks , winds up being 45 bucks because it 's on the wrong shelf . play a game next time you go here . see how many misplaced objects you can find throughout the store ... for instance ... a sirloin steak in the shoe department , or a bath rug in the electronics department , or a bag of garden soil in the womens lingerie department . ah but ... like the air i breathe , i ca n't live without wal-mart .		1		0
hate their two drink minimum policy which food items do not count for and their no picture policy . did n't use a flash , and everyone else was taking pictures and i 'm the only one they give a hard time to . wth ! they cram people in like sardines , and do the automatic gratuity thing . annoyed with the whole experience ! especially the picture thing , you 'd think forty bucks a ticket gives you the right to document the event .		1		0
i love chompies . i really do . just stay far far away from this place on sunday morning / afternoon . the place is incredibly understaffed . table for 3 with a baby . told us it would take 15 minutes to sit . it took more like 30 . we sit down . we wait 5 minutes , no waitress . a table next to us get 's seated . they get greeted , get their drinks then get their food order taken . then the same waitress comes over and takes our order . so now we 've waited 30 minutes to be sat and 15 minutes to have a waitress come to our table . i ask for 1 scrambled egg to come for the baby as soon as it 's ready . 10 minutes later a manager comes to the table with our egg . it 's undercooked and cold . very mushy . you would think being the manager , he 's qualified to take a look at a scrambled egg and know this is undercooked . it was quite obvious . i send it back . 20 minutes later our food comes out . still no egg . i ask the food runner . she comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate -lrb- a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes -rrb- if the egg was for me , i would have sent it back . but it 's for a baby and i would have cooled it down before i fed him . the food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order . if we wanted water or extra napkins , i got up and got it myself . this is n't my first rodeo . my wife had her baby shower here on a sunday and we got the same crappy service . i need to remind myself to stop coming here on sundays .		1		0
if you 're super fat and the only thing you care about is getting your 5000 calories in for lunch , this place is your mecca . if you have n't smoked your taste buds away , have eaten real asian food , or actually give a shit about what you put into your mouth and body , avoid , avoid , avoid .		1		0
upon entering riazzi 's , kevin and i were unsure if we had stepped into an italian restaurant or a nursing home . the patterns on the carpet and booths were horrifyingly dated , and the place was dingy and dark . the only thing that kept me from whole heartedly believing that we were visiting my great grandmother 's home was the waiters/waitresses/bus boys playing rhianna full blast in the kitchen as they talked loudly about their personal lives and friend drama and hair cuts . food was fine . nothing to write home about . but the atmosphere , oh gosh . never again .		1		0
i cant believe i ever went here , but my girlfriend did the models hair that were doing a fashion show for the ugliest homemade garbage . so i came for support . anyway , every dude in there looks the same . low rise seven jeans with a sparkley belt with shirt tucked behind the questionably femenine buckle , sunglasses inside , orange tan , waxed eyebrows , and shaved arms . i spoted the lone creepy old dude that was obviously on raver drugs , in the middle of the dance floor raving out . bros and sluts were all freek dancing and being douchy and slutty . a ton of younger chicks with older dudes . its one of those places were dumb sluts starved for attention come and make out with each other in front of the ed hardy faux buff guys . -lrb- faux buff = fat that looks like muscle under a shirt -rrb- whats up with all the faux buff dudes in scottsdale . you know what im talking about . i dont know why they would ever charge ten dollars to come here .		1		0
i used to work for us airways and i flew on them often because i flew for free . if it was n't for that , i think i would have flown any other airline . the planes to hawaii are so old and beaten up , it 's embarrassing . even most of the employees say that us airways is n't great . if us airways is the cheapest , i would go with them , but if you are paying $ 10 more for southwest , take southwest .		1		0
this has to be the filthiest restaurant i 've ever been to . everything is dirty -- the tables , seating and menus . the service is slow and rude . two of us went on a saturday afternoon when there were only two other tables of people in the entire restaurant , and similar to other reviewers ' experiences , we stood at the front for a while before we were seated , and then it took another 10 minutes for the server to come over and ask us if we wanted drinks . when we complained that we had been sitting there for 10 minutes , the waitress copped an attitude and acted as if she were doing us a favor by taking our orders . the food was blah -- nothing to get excited about . the only good thing about this place is the margaritas , but they 're not good enough for me to go back !		1		0
staff was friendly and it was busy , but they were definitely limited in their selection . i have never been to a buffalo exchange with such a little selection and what there was available was just meh , i 've seen better . the clothes to pick from were very generic , there was nothing that screamed out to me high quality ! or wow , what a cute outfit . i do n't think i will be returning anytime soon , i was very disappointed .		1		0
one of my favorite things to do is go out to eat . i had been eyeing this place 's menu online for sometime . it sounded delicious and gourmet and i could n't wait to try it . the restaurant it self is totally cute and cozy like a place you 'd take your mom . however it did not live up to my expectations whatsoever . first we were served some cold eggbread rolls with rock hard butter , not worth eating at all ! you can tell alot about a place by the bread and butter they serve . next she brings out our meals , she gives me the strawberry salad , it was not what i ordered but it did look good , so after waiting awhile she brings me what i did order , the wild mushroom , spinach and goat cheese tart ... all i can say is blah ! not very good or gourmet so i was looking forward to the sandwich my daughter ordered : california club it said it came on rosemary focaccia which i love , but this bread was so thick , dry and flavorless , just plain gross and very skimpy on the filling for the sandwich too . we had been drooling over their pastry platter the whole time thinking a lemon cake cookie would end the meal on a good note ... it tasted like a week old pancake with a little lemon icing on it . i was very disappointed , i will not go back and waste my money . this place is perfect for old drunk loud women , cause that 's what it was full of while we were there . the one star is for the being a cute place to look at , but i would n't eat there again .		1		0
i am only giving this place a ranking because yelp is making me . they actually deserve zero stars . the food was disgusting , the presentation was horrible , and the cooking practices were careless . when i found this place online i was really excited . i love to eat healthy , organic , and vegan when possible . it 's hard to find places that care about what they 're serving . typically vegetarian & vegan places do . this place obviously does n't care that much . i intended to order a mushroom po ' boy with fries but ended up ordering a side of fresh fruit instead . the reason being they have decided it would be wise to fry peanuts in the same fryer as their fries and other fried items . however , they do n't make mention of this anywhere on their menu . when asked if anything i was going to order had nuts in it they mentioned the peanut thing and asked how severe the allergy is . are you serious ? it is common knowledge that an allergic reaction increases in severity each time someone is exposed to said allergen . why would i chance it ? why would they want to chance a lawsuit ? i am allergic to tree nuts so i have to be careful and check every where i go . i 'm sure glad i did . peanut allergies are the most common nut allergies . how hard would it be to either note that you use your fryers for a common allergen or get another fryer ? once i actually got my food i was forced to look at a small cup of hard pineapple chunks , apples , and a couple bits of strawberry that had seen better days . the sandwich itself overflowed out of the bun & was so soggy it broke the bread in half so you could n't pick it up . the sauce they covered the mushrooms in was a disgusting combo of bbq sauce and garlic . i bet i had 3 cloves of garlic on my sandwich alone . two bites of this disgusting mess confirmed that i 'm never , ever , ever going back to this place .		1		0
i live right around the corner so i am here frequently . i 've shopped at other f & e s as well both in phoenix and los angeles and this one just is n't the same . sure the product is , the layout is , but that 's it . today 's experience was probably the worst i 've had here in a while . usually things are fine , i go in , get what i need , check out and go home . the employees are there but seemingly there just to take up space . today however , it was very clear that i was inconveniencing them just by being in the store . they are out of plastic produce bags and when i asked them employee gives me attitude , does n't say anything walks off . another employee standing next to him said they were out but that he would get me a grocery bag . i finished my shopping and went to check out . i asked the very unfriendly employee at the registers if they had the friends card and was told they were out . i asked if they had any $ 25 gift cards , i was told they were out . i continued checking out and she begrudgingly bagged my groceries -lrb- without me asking , i would have rather done it myself . um , ma'am , please do n't bag my bottle of wine in the same bag as the tortilla chips . -rrb- and then walked off . um , excuse me you just bagged 3 bottles of wine for me , do you think you could come over and authorize my purchase so i can leave ? ugh .		1		0
literally all of the food was brought out cold . we had our $ 100 meal comped but it was a total disaster . they did n't know how to handle it , it was extremely awkward -lrb- between the server and manager -rrb- , etc. . the kitchen has a prep problem between the meat & the veggie/side staging areas , etc. . this is one poorly managed restaurant . tons of staff just walking all over the place , looking important , but not doing anything . meanwhile , looking around , you can see everyone at every table has that glossy-eyed look just wondering when their server will be back . empty glasses , dirty plates , long food waits , etc. . workflow is horrible , people are inefficient , etc. . part of the problem is that there is a back-up for servers to enter the orders into the 2 computers near the kitchen . we sat right next to this area and watched as servers spent waaaaay too much time tapping away on the screens . this should n't be . bottom line - they need new managers and need to fire and re-train a bunch of staff . why they do n't have hh in the restaurant area is beyond me .		1		0
i managed to find a place that is actually worse than los sombreros and los olivos ! scottsdale is known for food but very average food , but even with those low expectations , this small restaurant failed to live up to its `` new mexico '' theme or to the definition of anything that i would consider fit to eat . it 's a bit like dining in a small warehouse , crammed in with other people just a bit too closely and having to speak spanish so that the bored people at nearby tables wo n't listen in . that works because we were the only latinos anywhere near the place . i do n't expect mexican food in restaurants to be like what we have at home so i do n't go with preconceived ideas to judge a place but food should be hot and i should not have to pick hard `` things '' out of my teeth as i eat it . a margarita out of a bottle should not cost seven bucks . these are just basic , common-sense items . other reviews speak of inconsistency in food and service . i guess we hit it on a very bad night , but we wo n't be back .		1		0
when a skeezy bartender tries to slip cruzan coconut rum into your drink without telling you they do n't serve malibu , it 's a big fail in my book . i saw him do it and he was n't even going to tell me . wtf , dude ? the big ball of fried , breaded appetizer was something i probably made in home ec 20 years ago , and should have never been let out of the kitchen . but alas , serve it they did . i went for a mixer and the service was less than good . i guess when you tell a place you 're bringing a buttload of people in , they do n't prepare . the a/c was miserable , bartenders were overworked and empty drink glasses just do n't cut it in my book . will i return ? doubtful . too many other places that do n't try to slip fake malibu to a guest .		1		0
i have put off writing this review for so long because the memories of my experience there are so ugly that i needed weeks to recover . it was my aunt 's birthday and she _ loves _ macayo 's . i went along begrudgingly and the results were terrifying . as a phoenix native , i 've known macayo 's on central for decades . its unique facade emulates the style of some grand guatemalan mayan temple , but ... no , not really . and what is it that you want when you see pictures of machu picchu or of tikal ? you want to climb the steps , to _ go in _ . in the case of macayo 's , you must resist this urge with all your might . the main entrance is from the back and is true to form in the egyptian style . a post and lintel rectangular opening leads to a long narrow hallway slightly sloped which opens to an antechamber branching off to the splendorous caverns within . um . except this article is about _ food _ , not a history of architecture lecture ! bleh . as is my custom i order a cheese crisp straight off ; i 'm allergic to corn so the endless bowls of hardened , impervious-to-rot corn chips -lrb- see pic -rrb- just repel me . after the pushy -lrb- more on that later -rrb- waitress scurries off i notice my fork -lrb- see the picture -rrb- and realize that with the caked-on food , this place might be cutting corners on lots of stuff , namely that the tortillas might be so cheap that they are the type to be sprinkled with corn starch to keep them from sticking to each other . the waitress returns and i ask her to please check the ingredient list for the tortillas for corn starch . a few minutes later she returns with the label torn from the tortilla bag and says that without her glasses she can not read the list . i 'm not joking when i say that the list goes on as long as this paragraph . chemical after chemical , non-food food after non-food food . and then there right in the middle is corn starch , corn meal , corn flour and corn syrup . in flour tortillas ! i immediately canceled my order for the cheese crisp and resolved not to place a single bite of anything into my mouth . `` was the water bad too ? '' i wondered . i 'm not sure where it started , but tex-mex goers have come to expect the attentive busboys to continually flit about filling and refilling bowls of corn chips and salsa . macayo 's sets the standard . it seemed the bowls dropped every few seconds as my family devoured them while waiting for the birthday girl to show . the salsa was gloopy -lrb- again with the pic -rrb- and might have had something added to the mix after it was poured from a gigantic vat , but i doubt it . my sensible companion said it did n't taste fresh at all . the birthday girl was almost 45 minutes late . after 40 minutes we discussed among us just ordering anyway . we decided to order , except that our decision quickly became an argument with the waitress who insisted that we wait for her . um , whoa ! is this really happening to me ? i must be in some kind of mayan burial temple , i 'm dead , and my servants and family were buried with me along with food and i 'm going to be here for the next thousand years until someone decrypts the secret book and inserts the starfish-shaped key into the stony entrance to free my evil spirit back on the world . aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!! yes , i loved the mummy movies . but back to our pushy waitress . after the family tried over and over , unsuccessfully , to cajole me into ordering something , anything , we waited for the results . you 'll have to see the pictures . you know you 're in a nightmare of menu hell when an item 's description has to change languages from english in order to accurately describe its content . the average speaker uses something like 20,000 words regularly and you ca n't even find a few to accurately or even poetically describe this item ? the steak was described with being covered in a spinach queso sauce -lrb- see pic -rrb- . those two words had to have been taken straight off the labels of the two cans that were dumped into a warming pot to create this sauce . think nacho cheesy , oil and corn starch and that lovely orangey-yellow coloring . disgusting . my brother ordered a taco plate -lrb- see pic -rrb- and made the mistake of trying to bite into the taco shell with his teeth . this item should have come with a disclaimer and a hammer . envision eating crab but with the shell still on it . he gave up quickly and dug out the innards with his fork , snail style . macayo 's should stick to their success like some cornstarch-less badly made stack of tortillas , namely large-scale manufactured canned foods sold to those who still think phoenix is a town of rolling tumbleweeds and cowboys . let them fantasize about questing to phoenix and entering the secret mayan temple to discover the secrets within . they can release my tormented soul from the hell that is macayo 's .		1		0
as much as i like five guys , i just got home and there was no meat on my burger ... how can you be a burger place and forget the most basic necessity . very upset that they forgot to put the hamburger on to complete the burger . everything else is on the supposed hamburger , lettuce , onions , tomatoes , ketchup , mayo ... but no meat ...		1		0
i am not a fan of this place . i like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial `` positive sandwich '' top bun : the location is fantastic . i really like where it is , its a cute little place that is very easy to find . the meat of the matter : the food here is odd . i am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures . as i have mentioned in other reviews , i love all types of food from all over the world . i did n't care for this place . i ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought i was eating an ashtray . it was n't good . the pad thai that i sampled was very lifeless . i had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i did n't try it . lettuce , onions pickles , tomato : the service was not good . i sat at the bar the first time i went here and we got ignored for the most part . the bartender -lrb- who i believe does n't work there anymore , luckily -rrb- sniffed at me when i asked for clarification on something . there are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar -lrb- probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc. -rrb- it was unappetizing to be around ... i do n't have a weak stomach at all , it was just odd . the second time i went in , the service was equally as bad . there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and i had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes . subsequently , the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes bottom bun : i like the owner , he is really nice and friendly . the cooks were also friendly . i like to believe that my taste buds merely did n't care for this place . i know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place . i will not recommend it as a personal favorite and i will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client . i am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things . i personally have not had a good experience with this place , but i respect the fact that a majority of the reviewers for it have .		1		0
after reading all great review devoted to tray this place for breakfast , they most likely has great food unfortunately for me i have to walk a way as my coffee was lighter than tea , they tray to explained that this is `` organic '' but seriously this is not a coffee		1		0
i understand i 'm not dude and so i 'm not there to stare at your `` twin peaks '' however , that being said i am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer i 'm over it . so i was never gon na come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time . fries were soggy and our server disappeared . we all decided were not going back . just because your a good looking server does n't give you an excuse for sucking .		1		0
if you are into that see and be seen , well scene then this is a place you might like . the food was over priced , and ok ... i guess . the service was horrible . snotty , i 'm too hot to be a waiter , what the hll do you want , attitudes totally ruined the experience for me . for better , cheaper italian food drive a couple miles south to sauce . same company , waaaaaaay better business model well , for us simple folk anyway .		1		0
this place is wayyyy too full of itself and substandard to receive anything more than a single star rating . first off , their id checkers have the arrogance and attitude of new york club bouncers - hey fellas , do n't flatter yourselves , it 's a crappy dive bar -lrb- just because you get some low-end scottsdale yuppies as regulars does n't mean you 're big time , k ? -rrb- . thought they were bouncing at studio 54 or something ... next up , the last two times i lowered my standards and entered this place i got no service . at all . i stood/sat up at the inside bar for a full 5 mins . once , and like a minute the next time , and said `` fuck this place . i 'm never coming back here '' . then , when i went to leave , i had to go through a phalanx of overly self-important security goons , and basically told them off . it 's kind of a shame , too , because this place is like a 10 min . walk from my house . no , on second thought , it 's no shame at all . for me . the shame is on them . whatever !		1		0
oh @thevigaz , you usually do so well , but when you fail me , it 's always an epic fail . last night , you fell flat on your face . i ordered the vigazz burger , anticipating greatness . my girlfriend and her daughter received their food , and finished their meals . i got nothing . while my girlfriend was still eating , i inquired with one of the back servers about my burger , and was told it was almost ready . 15 or 20 minutes after my party finished eating , i was still waiting . the other people around me , who 'd ordered around the same time as i -lrb- some before , most after -rrb- were finished with their meals , and still i waited . i had by this time decided i no longer wanted my meal , but no server was present to inform . while i waited for the server to come by to deliver the inevitable check , i noticed people who 'd arrived after we ordered , getting their meals . and still , i waited . finally , after over 30 minutes , and nearly having to yell to get her attention -lrb- she was delivering more food to people who came long after we ordered , right next to us -rrb- , our server came over . when we informed her that i did not receive my meal , and that my girlfriend 's order was incorrect -lrb- onions and tomatoes present , despite a request to not have them -rrb- , and instructed her to remove my meal , she just asked if i wanted it to-go . when your service comes up so short as to completely miss a meal , you do n't merely offer to make it to-go . in fairness , when she brought the check , she stated she 'd spoken to the manager , and he 'd also removed my girlfriend 's burger from the bill . it was a nice gesture , but last night it was too little , too late . i went home hungry , with a major headache . i love the vig , but sometimes it 's a major disappointment ...		1		0
i lived a few blocks from this place for 2 years , and only went there a handful of times when it was completely necessary . i can probably count them on one hand . it was always chaos in there . i actually walked in there at midnight 2 days before christmas once and it was destroyed . i understand it is going to be a litte hectic during the holidays , but there was no effort being taken to keep the place presentable . i do n't mean items misplaced , but literal spills of who knows what just laying around , it was insanity . at midnight . i got what i needed and left asap .		1		0
i 've been here 3 or 4 times before and the service is always spotty to non-existent , with the added insult of unfriendly staff . we came in last saturday and sat there for at least a full 10-15 mins . before i went up to the bar to politely see about getting some table service . how does the bartender reply to one of his valued patrons ? `` oh , yeah , are you at the table with the other guy glaring at me ? you 're supposed to wait to be seated . '' no kidding . in all the times i 've ever been in there was no hostess service , let alone a `` please wait to be seated sign '' . plus , it 's so dark in there they ca n't see you anyway ! we had to read the table menu by iphone light . so , when the waitress finally does show up , is she apologetic , congenial ... friendly in any fashion -lrb- not that i really expected her to be -rrb- ? i re-iterate that we 'd been waiting quite a while , and she snidely , rudely comes back with , `` well , you should have waited to be seated . or perhaps you should n't be served at all . '' once again , no kidding , folks . we 'd had a couple of glasses across the street , but were very much in control of our faculties . since when does complaining or commenting about being ignored equate to `` non-servableness '' ? and a completely rude and uncalled for tone towards the customer ??? is it any wonder in the world that your waitstaff gets told off and your full-of-itself establishment written off , when you create these situations through incompetence ? skip kazimierz and head to az wine co. , atlas bistro , citizen public house , and az88 where the staff are fun , friendly , competent , and know what great service is all about .		1		0
damn it feels good to be a gangsta ... i heard that song last time i walked in . the guy that made my sandwich kept rubbing snot off his nose and did n't wash his hands . he asked me if i wanted the wiz or if i was a skirt ... can you call a girl a skirt ... ? ... i went with the wiz wanting to appear like a educated philly girl . it was gross , really gross . the meat tasted freezer burned and so did the fries . . slathering the crap in cheese wiz only made it more apparent that i was going to have a heart attack before finishing it . do n't eat here , you 'll be sorry . . your stomach will drop kick you over and over . cheese wiz is gross . . they have other things on the menu , like greasy grease sloshed around in cheese , or for a healthier version you can add grease soaked mushrooms and peppers to your cheese soaked brittle bun . warning - only skirts do that . when you go to corleones you wan na be a gangsta . ok maybe not . . but i did want to cap the bitch that frightened me into ordering the wiz . .		1		0

this bar is based more on looks rather than authenticity of sushi . not that i have a problem with promoting ambiance , but i 'm more about authenticity and dive places . additionally the service was rather shoddy and imho rather racist . there was definitely a perceptible difference in service to people of the brown leaning as compared to the paler people . i 've been told that 's a phoenix mentality -lrb- but i still thinks it 's absolutely wrong -rrb- . as for the sushi well the gaari was bitter -lrb- a good sign that the place is unauthentic -rrb- and the slices of fish -lrb- which i ordered , tuna and salmon -rrb- were too thick -lrb- on the maki -rrb- and in the rolls too skimpy . shushi does n't have too many variables to play around with so the way to determine its goodness is based on these parameters -lrb- also on the taste/texture of the rice -rrb- . the lighting was too dim for a raw meat food joint . the servers were attractive though -lrb- again a sign that what they are selling is n't food -rrb-		1		0
look ... i 'm sorry ... but i just do n't get it . i like water , i like nature , intertubes are a-ok in my book ... so why do i loath this place . well ... here are a few reasons why : - drunk assholes ... everywhere . i ca n't stand annoying drunk people , and this place is a mecca for it . whether it 's the overweight frat guy or the backwoods overly-tanned middle aged yokul ... everyone is drunk ; and everyone is f * cking annoying as all hell . - dirty water . i mean ... seriously , i could n't wait to take a bath once i left . someone else in another review talked about getting a band-aid that was floating in the water stuck to them ... does n't surprise me . - getting burnt . i do n't care what anyone says ... you can slather on spf -1000 sunscreen every five minutes ... you 're gon na leave here hurting . blistering summertime heat in az ... floating down a river for hours and hours ... common sense says this just is n't a great idea . - scratching your ass on rocks . if you 've been there you know about this ... sometimes while floating , the water level gets a little low and you have to really make an effort to lift your ass out of the middle of the intertube to avoid jagged rocks beneath ... or else pain awaits ... if you do n't heed this advice ... sorry ... you 're leaving with a bloody asshole that day . well ... i could keep going here ... bottom line : just go to sunsplash or waterworld for god 's sake ... this place is not worth the hassle . the lazy river at any waterpark completely owns this experience in my opinion .		1		0
soooo , i had to start a whole new review for this place because i 'm at my word limit on my other review ! lol ! i had a friend in town from la this weekend , so we decided to go see dl hughley perform on saturday night . despite my previous poor experiences with sul , i thought that maybe since they have now been open for a longer period of time that they would have worked out their service issues . wrong ! my friend had purchased tickets for the 7pm show online and called in and spoke to someone about reserving a table -lrb- i.e. , buying a $ 60 mini bottle of vodka -rrb- to ensure that we would n't have a wait in line and that we 'd have reserved seating up close to the stage . so we get there and of course , no one has any record of his table reservation , and all tables up front had already been seated ! seriously , people ? this is ridiculous ! why on earth is your service so bad ? they said we could hang around and wait for the late show and still get a reseved table . um , let me think about that ... no ! i 've been there and done that . the 9:45 shows start an hour late , so i was not trying to stay there any longer than i needed . our server was nice enough , and my drinks were fine . however , sul really needs to get it together ! i had to adjust my review back down to one star ! boooo .		1		0
sadly this place is nowhere near as good if go around 2pm in the afternoon . 4 waitresses all just sat around the bar eating , speaking spanish and we could n't get service at all . had to turn on the fans ourselves , keep getting up to ask for refills etc. . . not good ! happy to fix review when they fix screwing up our company lunch that cost us $ 240		1		0
i am sorry , but my impressions are total different that the other reviewers . i am a stickler for customer service and total wines has the worst customer service i have ever experienced . i am a relatively big purchaser of high-end wines , not only for my consumption but for consumption by my wine `` club '' who meet regularly to try new wines -- especially the high-end , highly rated wines . i am not exaggerating , but on at least 8 ocassions , i have called a number of stores , sent faxes and emails , and have never ever received a call-back or a response . this is also true about their corporate offices . hq also never responds to inquiries . they might have a large inventory , but if you can never find what you want , what good is it ? also , their online website search capability is sorely lacking in capability .		1		0
actual date of visit : 3/6/11 wow ... i wish i had read the other reviews before going to this place . it was our first time to tempe marketplace and the cadillac ranch looked like a cool place to grab a couple drinks and some appetizers . we sat outside in the sun ... and that was the only good part . the first 3 beers my boyfriend tried to order off of their beer list , we were told by our indifferent waitress , that they no longer carried them . my margarita 's were weak . when our waitress came to take our order my boyfriend asked `` what 's really good ... what do people just love ? '' she shrugged , looked really confused , and said `` well , everyone likes different things so i do n't want to recommend anything cuz you might not like it '' . he asks that question every single time we go to a new restaurant and he 's always got great recommendations . so we decide to start with an order of nachos . 7 above average sized , greasy , round tortilla chips with melted cheese , a few black beans sprinkled on along with some chilis and tomatoes maybe ... for $ 7.99 . the sour cream and guac cost an extra $ 1.50 . at this point we still have no napkins or silverware . when we finish the tiny portion of nachos , we order the fried ravioli ... which we 're told a few minutes later that they 're all out . so , we just ask for the check , which i promptly put my discover card in and give back to the waitress . 2 minutes later she brings it back because they do n't take discover . why does n't that surprise me ?		1		0

ahh postino wine bar ... or is it postinos ? or postino wine cafe ? whatever ! i would definitely consider myself a postino expert . postino was a go to for countless dates of mine . i have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed . when i first stated going to this postino i loved it ! me and my roommate would visit every sunday religiously . we always got great service ! food was fantastic and timely . but it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees . i no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers . i had no idea it was there business how many women i take on dates there . you would think the business would be appreciated . i was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend . i would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date . very unprofessional staff at this location ! i recommend going to the newer central & camelback location if you are planning on visiting postino . pros : - cheap tasty bruschetta - reasonable wine prices - decent beers on tap - crazy fast but borderline annoying water refills - short wait times cons - rude servers - shallow menu - bad for taking dates		1		0

mamma mia 's has been around for a good while . and with four stars over 157 reviews - that 's a pretty solid number . hence , my degree of dissatisfaction is more a reflection of my disappointment that my experience should have been better than it was . they have an extensive menu with lots of options . all i really wanted was the standard pizza and wings , delivered . there are so many options for this in my neighborhood , that you would think competition would be fierce . well maybe not so . anyway , i opted for the standard in my house , a small pizza with a dozen wings . i added a couple of items , like pepperoni , black olives and extra cheese . i ordered the wings hot . it took a while for delivery , but it finally got here . it was halloween night , so that 's understandable . what 's not understandable is the burnt pizza that was delivered . oh , the toppings were fine , in fact , quite tasty , but offset by the charcoal-burnt taste of the blackened bottom of the crust , it kinda overpowered the entire flavor of the pizza . the wings were quite hot and tasty and i would order them again - probably the only place in my neighborhood that understands what hot means . alas , again , the burnt pizza . here is my problem with that . you know this pizza is going out for delivery . you know it is burnt . if you do n't then you should fire the cook . you assume that once the pizza is delivered , an hour after ordering , the customer is prolly not going to complain and insist you cook and deliver another . you are right about that . 8:30 at night , i 'm starved and no , i 'm not gon na wait another hour for you to fix this . you should have known the pizza was bad going out the door and you should not have let that happen . that was the good part of this experience . now for the bad . when i placed my order , and i looked at my receipt , i found these additional charges : $ 3.00 delivery charge . $ 1.50 `` transaction fee '' . 3.5 % merchant processing fee . and then of , course , your driver is expecting me to tip him ? so , around ten dollars just for the luxury of ordering a burnt pizza . -1 star for `` delivery charge '' -1 star for `` transaction fee '' -1 star for `` merchant processing fee '' -5 stars for either not knowing you 're sending out a burnt pizza , or for knowing it and sending it anyway . sorry , mamma mia , maybe a bad night for you , but it cost me $ 28		1		0
my problem with coup des tartes really is that the food is horribly overpriced ... not moderately overpriced makes you feel like you 're eating at a fancy place , but outrageously overpriced for the quality of the food . for their price points , the food should be a lot better and the tables should n't be so close to each other . their food reminded me of the kind of food i can get from the whole foods deli . after valentine 's day here , i felt taken advantage of by the restaurant . $ 100 per person for a measly set of 4 courses with the awful offering of cliched mushroom risotto as the sole vegetarian option , with no choice of anything else . had the menu been priced at around $ 40 a person , i still think this place would still only be a 3 star quality but at least reasonably priced . - brie brulee : a name far more interesting than the dish itself . it 's a warm slice of brie served with stale/boring crusty bread and fruit . there was the tiniest bit of fruit compote served with it , so at least someone in the kitchen did something that required effort with this otherwise simple dish . - onion tarte : probably the tastiest thing all night , but again , not worth the money . it has a very strong caramelized onion taste with a nice flaky crust . - salad : greens , fruit , nuts , and too much dressing . it was fine but not worth $ 25 . - chestnut soup : did n't taste a thing like chestnuts . the taste is actually like an indian lentil soup called sambar . - filet mignon : my boyfriend seemed to like it . the mashed potatoes it was served with were very good . the other accompaniment were sugar snap peas drowning in butter/oil . - lamb shank : the couscous & veggies served with the lamb were very boring tasting , like no one even took the time to season them . - cherry tart : this was yummy , and fortunately did n't taste much like cherry . the shortbread crust was good and the combination of warm pie with cold ice cream is classic . - chocolate ganache tart : pretty good . it , of course , tasted like chocolate . nothing really remarkable . i 'm confused why everyone calls this place charming . it is not charming to be a foot away from the tables next to you . it is not charming to hear their conversation like you 're having it with them , struggle to push out your chair to get up because there is another chair right behind you , and struggle to squeeze yourself between tables to leave . i can not recommend coup des tartes to anyone . the restaurant left a very bad taste in my mouth , figuratively . with so many other nice , moderately overpriced restaurants with much better food , i do n't know why anyone would come here .		1		0
i went with my friend for his birthday . he ordered 12 oz new york and i ordered the 8 oz tenderloin . i knew what different cuts of meat look and taste like . i meant business when it comes to steak !! our cook prepped our food in front of us , i noticed how each steak has different cut , while ny was chunky and short , my tenderloin was thinner . while i turned around in middle of the conversation , the steak was served onto my plate , and the first thing i noticed was how chunky it was . after trying the first bite , i know immediately that was not a tenderloin . just to make sure , i tried a piece of what was served to my friend , and i noticed my `` tenderloin '' was chewy and lean -lrb- what ny steak normally taste like -rrb- while his `` ny steak '' was soft and fatty -lrb- what tenderloin normally taste like . -rrb- i brought this to the manager 's attention , he came over and looked at the meat and told me that my experience with tenderloin could be improved if i requested to have my steak cooked with garlic butter . i informed the manager how each plate of steak tasted like and he insist that the fat / garlic butter makes all the difference . -lrb- keep in mind , my friend also did n't request the garlic butter . -rrb- lastly , he walked away with `` but i will see what i can do '' and never come back to the table again till everyone got their desert when they do the birthday picture for the table . i left my steak untouched simply cause i was n't sure if they will correct my order ... and end up leaving the place $ 40 short and hungry . i feel i was treated like a restart and very disrespectfully . i was n't taken serious and my concerns were taken lightly . though getting me what i ordered correctly would be nice -lrb- which did n't happen -rrb- , an apology would be highly appreciated -lrb- which also did n't happen . -rrb- as much as i love tepanyaki , i will never return to this location .		1		0
yuck ! gross burgers ! had a super burnt taste to it that lingered with me all day and night ... i could n't even eat something else to drown the burnt taste from my mouth , had to brush my teeth a couple times ... but jeez . how about something positive ! very nice staff ! clean kitchen : -rrb- great service , cute spot ... it 's just all about the food for me ... the fries were ok , but sorry lucky boy , no luck from me		1		0

after sitting at a table for about ten minutes , i asked the bartender why the server was ignoring me , he said there was no server , even though she was clearly present . if you are unable to take my money , i will be more than glad to spend it elsewhere . if you have a secret ordering technique , let a motherfucker know . sorry , the schedule of servers is n't posted on the wall , and as handsome as i am , i am not psychic . so in total , fuck you , fuck your ignoring ass server , fuck your bar , aand your schedule of servers , that apparently , everyone is supposed to know .		1		0

i am sad that this is the only baking superstore in my vicinity . perhaps if this store were located among the many craft and culinary boutiques in the heart of stepford -lrb- aka the east valley -rrb- , it would not be so highly rated and flocked to in throngs . i 've only attempted to shop here thrice but each time i have been unable to find any of the things i had been looking for . i felt snubbed by the baking ladies who 'd rather cackle amongst themselves about whose cardiologist was potentially worse than help a customer find a product . instead i blindly searched and was waved off to an area where the items `` might be '' and when happening upon an `` out of stock '' label on a lonely shelf , was offered no further assistance on how i might acquire said missing item in the future . i left the bakery as i had come in , without a greeting and without notice . it 's a shame this place blows so badly because it does smell amazing !		1		0
i am expressing my great disappointment with the service i received from the district in october 2009 . in the beginning of october , i approached the district to see if it would be possible to bring about 70 to 100 people on a thursday night at around 10:30 p.m. . not only did they say it would be great , they would have drink specials and have the happy hour menu available to our guests . and also , the manager had told me and another colleague there 's hardly any business on thursday , so it was great to have an organization interested in having a mixer at the district . thursday night came , the level of customer service and professionalism that the manager gave us was horrible ! the way he treated me , others and the fact that we brought about 70 to 100 people there itself was definitely something to remember . not only did they lie about accommodating our large group obviously the district could not do so , nor did the management team care to do so . the place was already crowded with other guests which is great for them however , the manager never tried to accommodate all our guests which they knew we were coming ! ... for seating , passing out menus . . the only way people were able to order if they were seated which they could n't , some individuals were waiting a very long time for a drink that cost $ 15 , there were no drink specials besides the beer and possibly the wine , i never i saw the menu , but i do know people were not happy with purchasing a tiny drink for $ 15 a pop ! the manager did speak to another individual with my guests at one point and had told him , individuals can not get drink specials at the bar , however , there was nowhere to sit , the majority of the tables were already pre occupied . also , the executive director of the non profit organization that i work for had ordered just a dr. pepper , he gave the bartender a $ 20 , received the drink and never received his change , when he asked the bartender , the bartender took his name down and did not give him his change . he has yet to receive his change for a dr. pepper . i never received a thank you for bringing people to the district that night . it was very disorganized and very unprofessional team at the district . also , the manager had said to me and the executive director that we would receive free valet parking since we were at the district , we had to pay over $ 40 for parking . it was a very frustrating night . bottom line , we truly did not feel welcome at the district . i was put in the predicament where i had to clear up confusions and make my guests feel welcomed . at one point had considered having a kickoff party and/or mixers at the district , bringing over 100 + guests , but after the customer service/treatment everyone received from the management team and wait staff , i am now reconsidering ever utilizing the district and the sheraton . as for myself , i was very disappointed and had expected great service . this is the funny part ! i did receive -lrb- a week later -rrb- an email from heinrich stasiuk , district gm . very insincere apology , the funny part ... he attached the email to the ongoing inside conversation between the managers stating i was difficult -lrb- sorry but you promise me certain things , should be able to keep it ! -rrb- also stated in the email `` but they made good money from us '' . if you are a business or non profit organization trying to find a place to hold your mixer or dinners , i hope either you reconsider or let them know you 've read my review ! since i was difficult , i 'm sure they will remember me and the fact they probably made about $ 3000 + off of my guests .		1		0
2 words : not good . the mexican food here is as far from authentic as you can get , plus it is overpriced . i got the chicken tortilla soup to start off with and it was soooo bland and flavorless and loaded with tons of cheesy goop . then i got a taco and tostada and both were of lower standards than taco bell -lrb- i would have preferred a taco bell taco -rrb- . when i go to a mexican restaurant in arizona i expect a freshly fried taco shell , not your store bought ortega brand taco shell and i expect shredded beef , but at aunt chilada 's you get the store bought shells and ground beef ! i wo n't return .		1		0

first off it does not stand out in anyway . i was looking for a big brewery and it 's just a small spot in a plaza . the decor is an old library mixed with a rundown dive bar . i sat down and looked over the beer list , 25-30 beers on tap which is cool . my friends rave about the pizza here so i was going to order the t-rex , but my waitress passed by me 7 times and did n't care to take my order . after that i lost interest and did n't want to eat here anymore and finally flagged her down , paid for my beer and left . as for the orange blossom , if you ever wondered what a creme soda would taste like in beer form this is it . not a fan .		1		0
blech ! let me start off by saying that my dad is the king of horrifying cliches . strangely enough , they 've actually become a vital part of my vocabulary and somewhat useful . 1 -rrb- if it sounds too good to be true , then it 's probably too good to be true $ 2.18 per dish for dim-sum ? 2 -rrb- you get what you pay for i was telling a buddy of mine that the price trumps the food and the service . after being away from the place for a month i forget how yucky the food is and the service is deplorable . 3 -rrb- fool me once , shame on you . fool me twice -lrb- 4 times ? -rrb- shame on me and i deserve to be ripped off the 3rd and 4th times . we were there on sunday at 11am and my wife remembered that the carts come out from the kitchen and go around counter-clockwise . her theory is that by the time they get to the north side tables , all the food will have been picked at and decimated . she insists that we be seated as far from the main entrance -lrb- north side -rrb- as possible . we get a table right up against the back wall closest to the kitchen . we 're sitting there for about 10 mins and no carts even pass by . i 'm like thinking , `` ok , dim sum is not really a fast food environment . you stayed up way too late saturday night and you stumble in for brunch . it 's supposed to be a slow , no rush , drink tea and have vibrant conversation with those around you . '' it was then that i started doing the math -lrb- not because i 'm asian . i know what you were thinking -rrb- . i counted about 40 tables with 30 of them occupied . i looked around to see what the mo of this place is . a -rrb- there are only 2 carts being pushed around at any time -lrb- are they trying to lower overhead costs by owning only 2 carts ? -rrb- instead of having several carts with the same items going different directions , it appeared that the cart pusher would only go back and fill her cart when it was empty . so instead of just exchanging her empty cart for a `` pre-loaded '' cart , she actually disappears for about 3-5 minutes -lrb- and i presume she 's in the kitchen loading her cart ? -rrb- b -rrb- since we had no food , i had time to count how many employees were on the floor and what their jobs seemed to be . 2 cart pushers , 3 bus boys -lrb- their job seemed to be water fillers , table clearers , and check retrievers -rrb- fine , we all know that you ca n't seat people if there are no clean tables . then i counted 3 more -lrb- waiters ? -rrb- with red vests going to tables and doing i do n't know what -lrb- taking special orders ? -rrb- . there was a man and woman that i assumed were the floor managers or owners that would be walking around doing `` managerial '' things like looking busy , answering questions , telling others what to do etc. . all the while i 'm thinking `` more cart pushers -lrb- the food is kinda important here -rrb- and less whatever the other 8 people were assigned to do . the 1 hostess/cashier was trying to seat people , take numbers , and take peoples money . i felt somewhat sympathetic towards her because i overheard a customer say `` you gave us number 22 '' and just seated another party when you called out `` 22 '' . she apparently gave two patrons the same number . she quickly apologized to customer `` 22b '' and out of frustration handed him a slip of paper with the number `` 32 '' . needless to say , the customer was not at all pleased with the exchange and hotly protested `` uh , i do n't think we want to go 10 places to the back of the line !! '' it was getting really ugly and awkward but one of the other employees came to the rescue by immediately seating `` 22b '' and things were restored to semi-chaos . oh , did i mention the food ? when the 1st cart came by our table , the pusher stopped by the table next to us and was fumbling with the little metal dishes and trying to cut the cheng-fun . she seemed a little shaky and not at all concerned with serving the customers swiftly . while she was trying to serve the other table , her cart was blocking the aisle and the other cart pusher had to stand there and wait until she was done . when the cart finally came to our table , we were so famished and anxious that we just started grabbing this and that in fear of never seeing the cart again . we grabbed the following dishes : 1 -rrb- shrimp cheng-fun : rubbery and kinda bland 2 -rrb- chicken feet : great sauce , but the chicken was not tender and again ... rubbery -lrb- perhaps leave it in the steamer longer ? -rrb- funny thing is , we 've ordered the same 2 dishes the past 3 times and it 's the same ... rubbery ! i guess you could say it 's our fault for falling for the same rubber chicken trick each time . 3 -rrb- har-gow : standard steamed pork dumplings , tasted pretty good -lrb- or was i just starving and grateful for anything that touched my chopsticks ? -rrb- haha 4 -rrb- wu-tao-gock : fried taro was decent 5 -rrb- foo-jook-gien : steamed pork with black fungus wrapped in bean curd skins . was probably the best thing that touched our palates . i know what your saying , why do you keep eating the dim-sum if the quality is mediocre at best and the service is non-existent ? price ! it 's like a mosquito drawn into a bug zapper .		1		0
i am sorry to say that this place has not fair well with me . saturday i order two cheese steaks and they were lousy . the mushrooms , rolls were ice cold and the onions were not fried onion . the french fries were greasy and messy . ** the service was polite . if it was not for the polite service this place would not be rated at all . there are two other places know in the valley for cheese steaks that would be rated 4 + stars they are in gilbert and chandler . btw if anyone of you are wondering , i do know what it takes to make a great cheese steak i was born and raise in the philly for the last 40 + year .		1		0
this was our first time going to someburros . i 've heard lots of people talk about it , but until recently had never eaten any of their food . we recently went to a party where we learned that the party throwers had ordered all of the food from someburros . we were loved the hot sauce and decided that we had to go in and get some for ourselves . we went on sunday afternoon and only ordered chips and hot sauce to go . the chips were stale - had to toss them in the oven when we got home . the hot sauce is tasty . the service is horrible at this place ! the server was annoyed by our questions , was unfriendly and seemed unhappy to be working . we felt like we were bothering her rather than her being willing to offer up good customer service . despite the close proximity to our home , we wo n't be going back to this restaurant . rather , we 'll be going to chili 's for their bottomless chips and salsa when we want a quick chips and salsa snack fix !		1		0
this place definitely does not do food like kittens do cute . . so we got the luis -lrb- ? -rrb- basically a shaved meat sandwich with mac and cheese subbed for fries and the trio of chips and dip . the chips were salted very inconsistently - some chips did n't have any salt and some would burn your tongue it 's so salty . they are also very stingy with the sauces - they only fill the cups about halfway with the salsa , guac and queso . the flavor of the salsa and queso were n't bad but the guacamole was basically a hacked up avocado with a few tomato pieces in it . bland . the sandwich was n't the worst , but was hard to eat . the veggies are arranged on top like its supposed to be open faced and the shape of the roll also makes it kind of ambiguous . i tried both ways , eating open faced style and tucking the veggies inside and biting sideways but either way its kind of messy . anyway , the meat is barely seasoned at all . an au jus or some kind of aoli sauce or really anything would have helped it a lot . the mac and cheese was n't bad . the sauce got a bit chunky when it started cooling off but otherwise the flavor is n't bad and they did n't overcook the pasta . so the food was not awful but not very good and at about ten bucks a pop , i 'd rather go to about a million other places so i think i probably wo n't be back . i 'm seriously getting flashbacks from a couple of those chips . . -lrb- not the good kind either -rrb-		1		0
come on , safeway . you are pretty much the only game in town for downtown right now . you would think your corporate office would recognize this and remodel and class this place up a bit . you have people who have money to spend living all over downtown phoenix now . the store needs to clean up its act , improve its customer service and cater to a new demographic emerging downtown . if i had a new better choice downtown , i would never step back in this rundown location .		1		0
this place is a farce and a travesty ... as are all over priced banquet style thai places that place a premium on marketability at the expense of food taste and quality . it 's the sort of place that fat english guys wanting to recreate their holiday in pattaya or koh samui would go . again , i go back to my rule about ethnic restaurants - the less people of that ethnicity you see patronizing the place the less likely you are to get a great meal . although they do serve authentic isan food on their menu - they recreate it unfaithfully and only in shades of what you really get in thailand . isan , is a poorer , ethnic minority in northeastern thailand that is significantly influenced by laos . true isan food is amazing - usually eaten with hand fulls of sticky rice - larb -lrb- ground meat , mint , and lime -rrb- , som tum -lrb- papaya salad -rrb- , gai yang -lrb- grilled chicken -rrb- , and sai krok isan -lrb- isan sausage -rrb- . any restaurant claiming to be the standard bearer of isan food , should serve these dishes with mastery . thai e-san does offer them , albeit at a ridiculous premium , but does so disappointingly . it is sad to see such a great regional cuisine get such a terrible representative here in phoenix . save your money and go elsewhere ... unless you are an english tourist in need of nostalgia ... in which case , proceed with my blessing !		1		0
so we have been wanting to try this place since before it opened and finally tried it tonight . never again ! it is decently priced for buffets but does n't come with a drink ... and then you get the food and start to think that it is now overpriced . the green beans were hard , the spring rolls were bland , as were the pork eggrolls and most of the food . my daughter loves rice and noodles and after one bite would n't touch the white rice or lo mein noodles again . the `` salmon '' nigiri was like plastic and the rice in the sushi was n't good either ... later found out that it is the same rice for the buffet and sushi . broccoli in the veggie delight and the beef n broccoli was pretty good but the beef was really fatty and chewy and the mongolian beef lacked . they have both hot and cold mussels , the cold ones drip a lot of water and come frozen and just get put out and the hot ones come frozen and get heated a bit , both are chewy . popcorn shrimp has very dry breading , chicken nuggets and fries could n't have been to good since again my daughter only had one bite of those . out of the soups the only decent one was the egg drop soup . even the mushrooms were kinda meh , it 's like they took a random brown sauce and threw some button mushrooms in it without doing anything else . it 's like everything comes in frozen but they do n't even get their food from a good supplier . the baked sweet potatoes were really but they do n't have brown sugar to put on them . and tim was our server person/glorified busser , and he did a great job and was friendly ... plus , we spoke with a manager and he was really nice but did n't seem like he has a firm grasp on everything and more make excuses like sundays being crazy days for them and that was why the floor was so dirty and covered with food and trash , and he did say that they are building more and already have some in other cities and states and that they all use the same recipes , so beware . lastly my guy will eat just about anything and even some of the most disgusting things and does n't have issues with it and before we left he was already running to the bathroom		1		0
it is really sad to have to write a 1 star review for this place . the food 4 stars , the fact that it is family own and run is a 5 stars , but service that i have received from the manager , david is a -3 stars . on the first day that the yelp coupon was released i bought it and used it . when i checked out , the cashier was confused because i was the first one to use the coupon . i later discovered that she originally charged my cards for the full price , $ 34.18 . she then charged my card for $ 26.04 . i know my math skills are a little rusty , but that is not a $ 14.00 discount , plus i was charged twice . that is not where the major problem lies . the major problem was that i had to make several phone calls attempting to get a hold of the owner or manager . when i finally did get a hold of david he told me that he did not call me back because he did not know who i was or what i wanted . he also stated that i `` should have left him a message about what my concern was . '' first david , you should call everyone back regardless of if they leave a detailed message . secondly , i was not about to leave a detailed message because the person that answered the phone each time struggled with their english to the point that they could hardly handle my name and phone number . i have no problem with the fact that they struggled with english , but do n't provide me with poor service by not calling me back because i did n't leave a message under these circumstances . here we are more than 2 weeks later and i still am struggling to get my money back . if the owner reads this , then it would behoove you to reach out to me to resolve this . we were so excited to have found your place just 2 months ago . we were on our way to being devout customers , but this might have changed that , primarily due to david 's attitude with me .		1		0
i 've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker . a couple nights ago , we stopped in at hava java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door . being the afternoon of july 4th , the place was empty , save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up . i ordered a cafe au lait , he an iced coffee of some sort . after asking me if i preferred skim milk or 2 % , the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar . really ? $ 3.75 for a cafe au lait and i have to pour the coffee myself ? i suppose that would n't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good . it 's amazing how much difference whole milk makes , but even beyond that , the coffee was weak and flavorless , and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk , my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk . lame . sorry , hava java - a repeat customer i will not become . p.s. - a $ 0.25 `` service fee '' is charged to all credit/debit transactions . again , lame .		1		0
do n't like , i ask for spicy not a jar of red chili pepper . one person wating on 20 tables . you think about how quick you get serve .		1		0
lame . $ 6 for small beers anywhere you go . most of the food plates at most of these trucks are $ 4 - $ 8 the whole thing is just kinda cheesy and not held in a great location . would be much better if held in civic plaza or downtown chandler or gilbert . this just feels like a great big money grab .		1		0
wow , i have n't ever had vietnamese food that was n't at the least ok . with enough sriracha , sambal , and fish sauce , you make just about anything taste good enough to eat . unfortunately , all the sauces , garnishes , and prayers could n't help me at saigon nites . it 's not so much that it 's flavorless food here , it 's just funky.i could n't tell if my pho was rancid , but it tasted that way . the appetizer sampler platter was nothing but `` from the box '' frozen selections most likely created by some giant corporation in nebraska and intended for the frozen food section at your local grocery store . on a positive note however , my tab for soup and frozen `` delicacies '' only dented my cash roll 52 bucks ... wtf ???		1		0
omg ! what the heck happened to this place ? it has n't even been more than a year since i was there last , and it has totally gone down the drain . the ladies restroom was worse than a truck stop restroom . i 've driven coast to coast 4 times , and from ca to az a plethora of times and have never been in a bathroom as sick as theres was . worse part about it was the managers rude reaction . i pointed out the fact that the toilet paper was all wet , making it impossible for anyone to use it and all he did was pile up rolls on the top of the toilet . he did n't even bother asking anyone to clean up the paper droppings ; being that the toilet paper was coming off in chunks there must have been at least 20 pieces of toilet paper all over the floor . i guess that is why the place was dead at midnight on a friday . the over priced drinks , the horrible toilet paper and the bartender tossing ice all over the bar each time he poured a drink might also have something to do with it . i 'm just saddened that with the influx of new businesses going in across the street , improving the area , this place is going straight downhill . the manager sunny was a smart a-s when i brought the restroom issue to his attention as well . guess i should n't have expected anything more , especially when the first thing you walk through when you arrive at this bar is a cigarette cloud ; as you have to go out front to smoke . this used to be my favorite spot , but alas the times are a changing !		1		0
ill never return to this location . i always order my filet and veggies with no butter/no oil ... and tonight i ordered the same ... except what came out tasted and looked covered in oil , butter and seasonings . the worst part is when i asked about it ... they denied saying no oils were used . it was obvious in looks and taste . yet after my meal someone else in my party commented on the lack of flavor - sure enough they cooked his meal with no butter , oil or seasonings ... you know if they would have listened , they likely would not have lost a customer . when i order this same thing cooked this same way at least 2x per week from various outback locations ... you would think i would know the difference ! it becomes very obvious ! this is the second and last time this has happened at this location ... never again as i 'll never be back . that was the worst service i 've ever had at outback or anywhere . in future i 'm driving out to the new outback locations in gilbert ... where they always get it right !		1		0
i am usually not one to complain about waits and time ... but this particular visit was very slow the hostess was so helpful and nice she noticed that we needed beverages so she just came and took care of us the cpk itself is busy but not swamped i am writing this as a continue to wait for my food i 'm also out of coke at the moment we just noticed that we were n't offered bread or anything there are so many servers just walking around but i do n't see any of them carrying food or drinks ... i 'm about to order a drink ... because the bartender seems to be on it ... foods here but we need silverware justine has come to our rescue , she is n't our server but she somehow managed to take care of us finished the meal , was good just waiting to get out of here now stay tuned ...		1		0
8/11/11 after reading so many reviews about how great maggiano 's happy hour was , i decided to check it out myself and use a $ 10 gift card that maggiano 's had sent to me in honor of my birthday . -lsb- yes , i 'm writing this review almost two years ' later ... i am that backlogged with reviews and photos - bear with me . i do n't think that these should be discounted based on how long it 's been since these visits , because i -lrb- and others -rrb- could use these observations to see if the restaurants and their service and products have improved , or in some cases , worsened . -rrb- -rsb- was going to try a couple of the apps when i spotted the four-cheese ravioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=gzmwrgnr3im5etxgk5rfiq#gzmwrgnr3im5etxgk5rfiq on the dinner menu . the description mentioned ricotta , cream cheese , mozz , and provolone in a pesto-alfredo cream sauce , and i was hooked -lrb- `` ricotta , '' `` pesto , '' and `` alfredo '' hook me in 95 % of the time -rrb- . unfortunately , the dish was a huge letdown ... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/maggianos-little-italy-scottsdale-3?select=dmecy1zfqidngrglm1e3sa#dmecy1zfqidngrglm1e3sa all but two of the ravioli were half-frozen -lrb- especially at the edges -rrb- , and the flavors ? all of the cheeses , marinara sauce , and pesto-alfedo cream sauce tasted the same ! all bland , without any distinction between them . i tasted samples from allover the plate , from all components , separately and together , and could n't discern any difference . even the entree 's appearance was subpar . suffice it to say , i have not stepped foot into another maggiano 's since . the two good comments i could say are that the restaurant was quiet -lrb- no one was there -rrb- and the plates were quaint-looking , with that old-fashioned rose-and-bone tinted floral print .		1		0
yeah - cool name but the place sucks . the people that work there are ... i wo n't even comment . the place is just not good . the food is not good , and they have non existent options for vegetarians . they are overpriced . the location is good , being that it is at the scottsdale waterfront , but they are located on camelback road and its hard to find parking . once you do , you have to walk a ways to get to pink taco . the only good thing about this place is they have outdoor seating . the downside to that is you have to look at and hear the camelback road traffic . go somewhere else if you want my opinion .		1		0
it takes a lot for me to write a negative review . i decided to stop here for a quick wednesday night dinner . it was busy , but not a friday night busy sort of evening . we opted to sit out on the patio-once we were seated , is where my experience at half moon went sour . we sat there for at least 10 min before someone came to take our drink order . our waitress disappeared , and it took another 15 min for her to reappear with our drinks . i 'm annoyed at this point . .25 min just to get my drinks and you hav n't even taken my order ?! in that time . . about 3 other tables fill on that patio . . those same 3 people get up and walk out because of the lack of service . our appetizer finally arrive i -lrb- we 've now been there for 45 min -rrb- , and i say `` i was wondering if we were forgotten '' , and the food runner then decides to yell at me . yes , me , the customer . the customer who has been waiting close to an hour for a sandwich and a soda . he screams at me , and i quote , `` look-the upper floor is packed , and we can cook only so much at a time '' ... and storms off . what just happened here ?! did that employee seriously yell at me and try to school me on the workings of a restaurant ?! we had been sitting there for so long that by the time we would have left , we would have been stuck waiting elsewhere anyway . i couldnt believe the complete lack of service , courtesy , and the outright rude employee , who needs a serious training course on customer service . we ate our meal . . chuckled at how insane it all was . . the ` upper deck ' is a 2 step elevated section inside so we had a good laugh at that too . to top off the miserable experience , the food was below mediocre over cooked , the cole slaw was awful , and we kissed any chance of our drinks being refreshed goodbye . it was like we were the exiles on a deserted island begging for a beverage . half moon will never see my hard earned pennies again . i 'd rather run down the street to sonic !!!!		1		0
sorry gang would give this place no star if i could . ear muffs if you ca n't handle the truth -- parental advisory ! first off the quality of people that attends this place is piss poor . if i wanted to be insulted , spit on , and get in a fight . i know where to find it -- this place ! classless along with a bunch of douches following my lady friends around like a prey . i had to tell them to stop cause it was creeping everyone out - sorry dude with a dragon shirt can you please stop following ! by the way douche # 2 just because i 'm well dressed and can sport a tie , does n't mean i 'm gay . it means i have taste so f-off ! how about that female dog that pointed south and said go away china 's that way -- sorry you poor example of a hairless chiuaua ; china is technically west . unfortunately , you did n't know that because your man feeds you low end pet chow ! as part of an asian organization i would n't want any of my members attend this place . only one good thing came from this place -- the doorman was nice . - enjoy !		1		0
i was on a date with my daughter , dammit . here 's how it works : every other wednesday each of us takes a daughter out to dinner . that way we get to have dinner with each of our daughters once a month . it 's a great opportunity to check in -- hopefully they will open up at some point . anyway , this time my oldest picked indian . i was thrilled . usually they both pick chinese and , much as i like it , it does get tiresome . meanwhile , back at the review , we ordered the meat appetizer . this had a couple kinds of chicken , a meat samosa and lamb kabob . it was fine , not bad , not brilliant . my daughter got chicken tikka masala , her favorite . i tried a ginger kabob at the waiter 's suggestion . these , too , were fine . no fine dining but not bad . at this point i did n't realize that they nickel and dime you so i was still oblivious as to what this mediocre food was going to cost me . then we went to the bathroom . we were nearly done and my daughter asked me to accompany her . that 's where we saw it -- the cockroach . it was easily an inch long before you got to the antenna . to be fair it was dead . but at some point it had been alive and had had plenty of time to grow oddly large . now i realize that i 'm new to phx and there are palmetto bugs here but i used to live in an old brownstone in the city and i know a cockroach when i see it . it was right under the empty toilet paper dispenser . i told the waiter that the toilet paper dispenser was empty , hoping that he 'd see the roach and know that i saw it . i paid the bill and left , intent on warning yelpers everywhere .		1		0
stopped in here around 6:30 on saturday night after our movie got out . we asked to be seated outside and got a table quickly , although then we wished we had an umbrella because the misters were drenching everything . the host saw us scooting the table over to avoid the deluge and was nice about offering to help us out . after waiting for what seemed like way too long for some acknowledgement from our server , another server came by and offered to get us started with drinks . our real server showed up later and introduced herself , brought us water and then scooted away ! even though we had been looking at the menu a good 15 minutes and were ready to order . so we waited ... and waited ... . . and waited . in this time i grew very impatient and realized that i had a whole wine rack at home and a fridge full of food . we were deciding to eat out for the ambiance and experience and so far this experience was not worth my time or money . when she finally returned i had mentally checked out and told her we were n't hungry . she left our table as if she really did n't care anyway , and that first server , who was n't ours came by to check on us and we said we 'd take the check . never been here before . awful first impression .		1		0
i 'm a little disappointed , it seems like i 've eaten here before and it was n't so bad . the caesar salad dressing tasted mostly of mayo . they cooked my medium steak pretty well , but turned out they had switched my friend 's steak and mine and his was supposed to be medium rare . i feel a steak restaurant should know how to cook a steak . the mashed potatoes were lumpy . they tasted ok , and did not feel pasty but could 've used some kind of flavor . the green beans were actually pretty good . the salmon was cooked well but the citrus based sauce was a bit too sweet . the sauce that came on the steaks was better , but did n't have much flavor . the steaks themselves could 've used a bit of salt and pepper . the creme brulee was pretty tasty as always but i was n't a fan of the flourless espresso chocolate cake . all in all , i do n't think the experience and food is as put together as their competitors . the waitress also seemed a bit joyless which did n't help the experience . with so many better options , i do n't think i 'll be back anytime soon . maybe for lunch ?		1		0
i experienced famous daves bbq late one after work . a co-worker and i stopped by during the last half hour and he promised the food was amazing : he was n't kinding ! we had a sampler with bbq sandwiches , but before we got our food the waitress gave a little tutorial on all their famous sauces in a cool little presentation -lrb- that we got to taste of course -rrb- . my favorite sauce : rich and sassy ! the best part about famous daves is that you can buy the sauces to take home . and , be sure to check out your walmart because they might even have the famous sauce for sale . : -rrb- all around famous daves is great ! and its a national chain , so you can find them all over the country .		5		1
always a wait , but so worth it ... i went to houston 's for dinner tonight -lrb- saturday -rrb- with my parents ... i was smart and checked to see if they take ` call ahead , ' which they do . i called at around 6:30 and there was an hour wait . i put our name in and arrived just before 7 . my parents arrived at 7:15 and we were sat at 7:20 ish , so it worked out perfectly ! not much i can say that has n't already been said ... excellent service -lrb- tonight we had maria and chelsea helping us and they were great -rrb- , yummy food , and great atmosphere too ! my favorite menu items are the spinach dip appetizer , ahi tuna sashimi salad , the veggie burger , the fresh fish of the day , and all of the sides are delicious too ... i always have a difficult time deciding what to get ! tonight , the specialty appetizer was the grilled artichoke which we had to order - it 's grilled just right and served with a dip that tastes like heaven ! i changed it up a little and ordered the cheeseburger for my meal - it was so worth it ! the flavors of the meat . cheese , buttery house made bun , tomato , lettuce pickle and onion ... yum ! i shared fries , maple glazed carrots , and broccoli with my mom -lrb- who ordered the fresh fish sandwich -rrb- . my dad ordered the filet -lrb- 14 oz -rrb- and it came with a baked potato ... needless to say , we did n't save room for dessert . if you do save room for dessert , go for the apple walnut cobbler ... it 's up there as one of the best sweet treats for sure ! i 'll have to remember to save room next time , it 's just that the food is so damn good , i always clean my plate ! like i said , it 's worth the wait !		5		1
so i finally made it back after the awesome soft opening event i attended and boy i 'm a moron . why the h e double hockey sticks have n't i went back since ??? brought the wife and a friend and we were all just blown away at how good the food was . we checked in and found out there was a 60-90 minute wait , so we left our phone number and headed to rose and crown for a drink and a small appetizer to tide us over . after about 15 minutes , they called and told us our table ready . we just took our rose and crown snacks to go . i ordered us around of the orion beer , which was great dinner beer . we started with the teeter tots , lightly fried tofu in this sweet somewhat spicy sauce with bacon . holy cow !! i 've never ever had tofu that good . we ended up getting a second order . we also got the japanese eggplant with red miso and bacon , totally great . the largest plate we ordered were the coconut curry grilled lamb chops . they were seriously the best lamb chop i 've ever had . they had this coconut curry crust on them , cooked rare served with this mango/meyer lemon salad . just killer . we also had the steam buns with pork belly , another homerun . all total between the 4 beers , one cocktail and 5 dishes we had , the total damage was around $ 90 . every penny well worth it , sooo excited to go back !!		5		1
giant coffee ~ you 're the reason i get out of bed before 8 am on sundays ! i used to be a habitually sunday sleeper inner ... not now since i was introduced to giant . . and i do n't even drink coffee . it 's the atmosphere i return for each week . although i must say their bagels are tasty , the homemade cream cheese spreads are delicious and the pastries decadent . for a drink i go with an iced chai then an acqua panna later on . i abhor bottled water -lrb- wasteful ! -rrb- but this is my one sunday vice . shall i go to confession now ? let me now address the parking situation ~ it 's quite easy ! go park in the cvs lot , towards the back . there 's some shady trees and you can walk right across the cancer survivors park to giant . if you 're lucky you may see the family of bunnies that have been hopping around . just please remember to leave a shady spot for me on sunday mornings ! cash only ~ so what ?! grab a few bucks from the atm or buy some sundries at cvs to get cash back . cash is king in this economy and i ca n't say i blame them for this requirement . atmosphere - completely relaxed and chill . my group normally takes the two brown chairs up front on sunday mornings . perfect spot in front of the huge floor to ceiling windows/doors , which by the way open up when the weather is n't 150 degrees . groovy music flowing through the place at a volume you can hear , but wo n't interfere with your conversation . employees - cheerful and helpful . they know their stuff and are quick to make a recommendation if you ask . and they wo n't make you feel silly either ! oh , and gio is the best . bottom line ~ simple space , simple offerings for a simply delightful sunday morning .		5		1
i have to give this place 5 stars . yes , 5 stars ! i am not a big fan of watching sports on tv since i love the joy of being at the game , however the energy at this location is better than attending a sporting event . the food is great . i mean `` great '' . i have enjoyed everything on the menu i have tasted so far . there is something on the menu for everyone and any type of dietary need . my favorites are the boneless wings , chicken strips -lrb- real white meat -rrb- , and the taco salad . i am surprised the french fries have not put mcdonalds out of business . they are addicting . to top it off the they have top notch service . i have never had a problem , compliant or been disappointed . you can tell the employees love the place that they work out and enjoy to serve the patrons . my office has had several private parties at this location . they have two areas where you can throw parties . my favorite is the cotton room . it is a private room that is very hip , urban , all white with glass mirrors surrounding the room . kinda like a mini retro dance space . it has plush leather white seating , big screen tv 's and a private bar . the resturant does catering and take-out .		5		1
okay , i admit it , i have an apple addiction . having an apple a day is just not enough for me . i like to have several apples a day , every day . yes , i like to go to the store and just hang out , try out their new products and programs and i ca n't wait to enroll myself and my son in their abundant free workshops . gosh , i am unabashingly gushing about this place . apparently i 'm not the only one as the place is always busy , from morning to night . seriously , i 'm not kidding . if you need to talk to a genius at the genius bar , make sure you book an appointment online first and either bring a book or some work with you or be prepared to use one of their many available apples that are for your use to cruise the internet because these guys are never on time with their appointments . instead of getting upset , be understanding . because well , these appointments are hard to time when the client is trying to understand something . i mean , what 's worse to have th genius tell you he has to go to the next appointment to keep his schedule or to work with you until your problem is resolved ?? just enjoy the vibe of the place while waiting !		5		1
some people say brunch is just an excuse to get drunk in the mornings , some people just call that mornings , but either way with unlimited mimosas and blody marys for $ 15 , you 'll get the job done . this place is beautiful - large windows that let in loads of natural light , exposed brick everywhere , hardwood floors , and white marble table tops make you feel like you 're in a designer 's home . also , i 've never had to wait more than a minute to get a table - which is a huge plus when you 're hangry for brunch and mimosas without bottoms . the food is a modern take on french and italian flair . my friends ordered eggs benedict -lrb- there is an option for a benedict trio where you can try three of their four delicious eggs benedict options for $ 15 -rrb- . the eggs were perfectly cooked and the prosciutto and oven dried tomatoes played very well together . i landed on the steak and eggs . the steak was wood grilled skirt steak . it was delicious , my only qualm was that i should have ordered it rare instead of medium rare as it came back barely pink in the middle . despite that , it was n't dry and it still had tons of flavor . the best food part of our brunch experience by far was the stuffed french toast . it was brioche stuffed with sweet cream mascarpone , topped with bananas and drizzled in peanut butter maple syrup . there were literally bricks of toast stacked on top of each other , as wide as they were tall . if you 're in the market to build a house out of delicious french toast confections , in a convoluted plot to trap and eat two german kids , and also you 're a cannibalistic witch living deep in the forest - this is definitely where you 're going to want to get your construction supplies .		5		1
this is the first visit for peg and me to this fun place . we have followed chef curry for years and you know when you read his background and affiliations that he is one of the great ones in the valley . this ai n't your hormel in a bun ! peg had the duck , duck , dates sausage and i had the guest chef sausage -lrb- chef justin beckett 's bbq pork and jalapeno . . some proceeds going to the leukemia and lymphoma society -rrb- . the chopped wedge salad was great , the pretzel was stupidly good with choices of mustards -lrb- honey and whole grain were just scrumptious -rrb- . and the belgian fries were crispy ... without being asked to be made that way . this is indeed a go-back . dr. b		5		1
i never really understood what the big deal was with crepes , but the crepe bar made a believer out of me . the menu is basic , but that simplicity also makes it classic . there are three sweet crepes - nutella and bananas , cream and berries , and a house special of crème brulee . the savory crepes include a burrito and a few others -lrb- sorry , ca n't remember ! -rrb- . husband and i ordered two berry crepes and a vanilla latte . as we waited for our food , we watched the burrito go by and decided we 'd have to come back and give that a try - it looked delicious and enough to split . my latte arrived in a black ceramic cup with a foam heart on top , delivered by a smiling employee . first sip - heavenly . -lrb- one of the better lattes i 've had recently and i 'm a coffee snob . -rrb- quickly our crepes followed , looking beautiful on pristine , white plates . there were strawberries , blueberries , and blackberries dancing over sweet cream with a singular crepe rolled up and sliced into rolls - might have looked skimpy , but definitely filling . husband requested caramel be drizzled over his , adding a sweeter taste to his crepe . crepe was light and airy , no crispy edges and just sweet enough . the cream and berries were definitely fresh . the location is a bit hard to find and for us the drive takes 30 minutes with no traffic . committing to that kind of drive time just to get some breakfast food , it 's got ta be good , right ? damn straight . the inside is a bit sparse , i do n't remember any wall art , but there are plenty of tables and chairs . on the steel counter top , instead of a regular cash register , they use an ipad - which gives them cool techie cred . you can also see the chef at work , which is nice to see where the food comes from . overall , i would definitely recommend this place to take your date , relatives , friends , maybe even strangers - just gather them all up and prepare for deliciousness .		5		1
hands down my favorite place in the phoenix metro area right now . they have a really great happy hour , an extensive tap beer list , and a life changng veggie/vegan menu ! i am absolutely addicted to the gardein veggie buffalo wings . beyond amazing . the tofu lettuce wraps are delish as well . i 'm really glad to see major restaurants catering to all sorts of dietary varieties versus leaving us veggies with the option of a side salad or plain pasta ! chances are you will see me here at least once per week with a dogfish head 90 minute ipa and two orders of the buffalo veggie wings ... sometimes twice ... so if you have been waiting for that perfect moment to make contact with me , well , i suggest you hang around yh each night about 530 .		5		1
so , there is a strong possibility that i am in love ! this place is great ! i walked in thinking that i was just going to have a couple of drinks , but when i saw that they had an individual starter and sides section in the menu i got excited ! so that means that i can try several different items without completely breaking the bank ? i started with the sun dried tomato risotto . omg ... loved it ! will go back for that . i was actually full after that , but indulged and ordered another one ! i also ordered that and the mac and cheese too ! the mac and cheese was good , but i really wanted to lick my bowl after the risotto . my husband ordered the switch burger that was recommended by our wonderful server . delicious ! it 's at the top of my list for best burgers ! they have a great happy hour with certain drinks at less than $ 4 and an appetizer option for a discounted price . our server josh was great and the ambiance was contemporary too . i will be bringing my friends here !		5		1
5 stars for the guacamole alone . seriously , it was amazing . my expectations for gallo blanco were high , based on my fellow yelpers ' reviews , and i 'm so happy that all of my expectations were met . the food was simple , fresh , and unbelievably delicious . for the service i might only give 4 stars , but i think the evening was just busy . my friends and i shared the guacamole appetizer , and i really can not rave about it enough . it is made to order and you can taste its freshness . i loved the huge chunks of avocado . it was so good that we ate it with forks once we 'd run out of chips . for dinner , i had two tacos and a side of beans . one seasonal veggie taco -lrb- green cauliflower with zucchini , mushrooms , onions and pico de gallo -rrb- and one cephalopod taco -lrb- octopus -rrb- . the veggies were marinated and cooked to perfection , and i was delightfully surprised with the octopus . taking a risk and eating something different really paid off . the beans were topped with cotija and were neither too salty nor too runny . my friends had the house salad , pork taco , pico rico burger , and veggie torta and were just as pleased as i was . i spent $ 8 on my entree - it 's hard to beat that price for such good food . once you factor in the appetizer , drinks and tip , i spent $ 20 total . not bad ... not bad at all . the restaurant was loud and it was hard to hear at times , but it was a saturday night , so i 'm not going to hold it against them . a waiter could have spilt hot water all over me -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and i would still give this place 5 stars . i loved it and ca n't wait to go back to try their breakfast .		5		1
best value dining in phoenix we always go for the 3 -lrb- like 4 -rrb- course menu -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and shared cesar salad that was big crisp , fresh with house made croutons followed by butternut -lrb- 3 bigger sized -rrb- squash raviolis -lrb- so tasty piping hot in tasty flavorful sauce -rrb- i had a combo platter of sole , arctic char , vegetables and seasoned rice . everything on my plate was absolutely delicious , both fish were so fresh and cooked so perfect , the assortment of vegetables were hot and crisp . this dish came with rice and it was one of the best rice dishes i have ever had out ! my husband had the filet mignon cooked to a perfect medium rare with a peppercorn sauce , fresh vegetables and potatoes au gratin . we still had room for the dessert that was soon to come since the dinner proteins are very small -lrb- i do note very small -rrb- but it is small done right , with vegetables and a starch side . a waiter surprised us with three mini desserts cheesecake , strawberry cobbler and the yummiest lemon tart with a mini scoop of raspberry sorbet . -lrb- he just gave us an extra i think -rrb- easy on your wallet and also your stomach . it was so nice the perfect portions , you could eat a lot without feeling like you ate too much . wine is priced reasonable . service has always been very good .		5		1
like f.o. said , discovering bookman 's is like hitting the freakin ' motherlode . they have so much stuff it 's uncanny . it 's like what pawn shops would be if they were n't filled with seedy people and crappy , overpriced merchandise ... and , y ' know , if they had books . books , magazines , action figures , board games , video games , puzzles , cds , dvds , electronics , camera gear , random tchotchkes ... it 's worth going regularly to discover what they have at the moment . you never know when you 're going to find a smoking deal on some thing you 've wanted forever -lrb- or never knew you wanted -rrb- . they even stock vhs , audio cassettes , laserdiscs , and vinyl , if you prefer older technologies to newer ones . and all the employees are so friendly and knowledgeable and generally awesome ... just go already !		5		1
stinkweeds shaped my formative years . really . i started shopping at the -lrb- now gone -rrb- tempe location when i was 15 . i had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store . i begged my parents for rides and , when that was n't happening , hopped on the bus for the hour-long trek . totally worth it . 100 % . i ca n't tell you how many awesome bands i began listening to just because i would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting . if i needed something specifically , stinkweeds would order it for me if they did n't already have it in stock . the staff was always welcoming and helpful , sometimes offering their own suggestions . but it 's just a record store , right ? wrong . stinkweeds is the jewel of phoenix , as far as i am concerned . now that it 's out in central phoenix , i make it in far less . total bummer !		5		1
when i came here for my first visit , last december , it was cold inside & they had run out of tamales , so it cost them a star . this time it was a bit warm inside , but with it 114 degrees outside , i was inclined to cut them a little slack . also , the food here is so special that you just ca n't hold them down to 4 stars forever . really ! : -- rrb - so anyhow , this little madhouse was filled to capacity , at 7:45 pm this evening , but i got lucky & scored a table , & ordered a taco de asada -lrb- steak -rrb- , a taco de pescado -lrb- breaded fish -rrb- , & a red chile beef tamale . my order arrived at the table in a short time despite the crowd , & was accompanied by both red & green salsa cups & a tray of grilled onions & green peppers to add on to everything . so , how was the food ? out of this world good !! yes , this very plain little place makes itself very special & mr. big guy running the place found the time to give me a strong `` thank you '' for coming , just as he did last time . taco de asada : $ 1.25 taco de pescado : $ 2.00 tamale de carne de res : $ 2.00 i think this friendly , busy , noisy , plain little place with its inexpensively priced sensational food is absolutely 5 stars !! : -- rrb - -rrb-		5		1
i am sooooo excited my neighborhood finally has a place we can go for great food ! my husband and i stopped in to this small establishment , and we were greeted by two smiling faces . we ordered the reuben for me , and my husband ordered a single cheeseburger . we both ordered fries . we also chose 2 sodas from the exciting selection . my husband and i decided to get our food to go . as soon as we got into the car , my husband said , `` oh my gosh , that smells awesome ! '' the food looked excellent . the thinly cut fries were fresh , made to order , and the reuben was huge !! it tasted as good as it looked . my husband swears the burger was much better than lenny 's , which is a big compliment from him . we will definitely return , maybe even this week . i hope locals frequent this place , so it stays open for a long , long time !!! yummy !		5		1
i was recently introduced to the lair of lusciousness known as totties by my good buddy -lrb- and fellow yelper -rrb- alexander c. alex had been to totties asian fusion ii very recently and was so impressed -lrb- believe me , this guy is discerning , so for him to give something a thumb 's up -- you 'd best believe it -rrb- that he organized an outing/evening for like 10 big ol' bears of men for a sake bomber happy hour & dinner . see alexander 's review for exact details and descriptions of what we ordered and ate , but i 'm going to make this review short & sweet . tottie 's rocks . the service was impeccable . tottie herself came to our table and made special recommendations on food . i 've never felt so attended to by a restaurateur before . this lady knows her stuff in the front of the house , but even more so , she can cook her petite asian ass off . everything we had was amazing and her thom kha kai soup blew my socks off . i crave ... for days ... the parking lot 's a little wonky now during construction , but it 's a small price to pay for this level of amazing food . we were 10 hungry heffers when we arrived -lrb- not one of us under 200 pounds , so you know we like to eat -rrb- and no one walked outta the place hungry or needing anything . service & food to the max . i applaud tottie for opening a second killer location and i thank alex for introducing us to this amazing pocket of awesomeness deliciousness !		5		1
love it ! who does n't love a buffet where you can eat until you wished you had worn your elastic waistband pants ? at least here you can fill your belly with good stuff . now , do n't get me wrong . i 'm not in denial . there are high calorie salad dressings and mayo-laden pre-mixed salads and fried croutons , but if you know anything about nutrition you can gorge on a huge variety of veggies and leave full and satisfied . not to mention that they have homemade soups -lrb- i love the fact that their stuff is homemade -rrb- and muffins that are to-die-for . those are my biggest indulgence . i have been many , many times and have yet to be dissapointed . we recently tried their breakfast buffet on sunday mornings and aside from their usual salad bar they have wonderful options like belgium waffels , french toast , a breakfast buritto bar , and the most addictive cinnamon rolls . go after a morning run so you wo n't feel guilty eating those !		5		1
a dozen or so cohorts and i gathered for last week 's vikings/packers game and the service was spectacular . we arrived 15 minutes before kickoff and as you can imagine the place was being overun with purple jerseys . to accomodate our large party the manager opened up the previously roped off back room and gave us free rein of the joint . it seems like the obvious play but you 'd be surprised how many bar managers do n't see the value in going the extra mile for bigger parties . our table shared a plate of nachos -lrb- a - -rrb- , cheese bread -lrb- b + -rrb- , and soft pretzels -lrb- a + -rrb- before diving into beer breads -lrb- a + + -rrb- and burgers -lrb- b -rrb- . it 's not high brow fare but it is bar food done right . as a minnesotan i 'm probably totally biased when it comes to reviewing a vikings bar but i truly believe that the beer bread and hop knot are elite , regardless of where you 're from , wisconsin goofs included .		5		1
if memory serves me correctly , this might have been the best lunch i 've ever had . -lrb- maybe the most $ $ $ as well , goes hand-in-hand -rrb- . melted brie with grilled apples , pears , strawberries ? yum ! 3 onion tarte ? very sweet , but the sav blanc cut through the sweetness with it 's grassy edge & complimented it perfectly -lrb- you have to bring your own , if you do n't already know -rrb- . the spicy asparagus soup ? slurp ! -lrb- again , i never thought i 'd say this , but the wine went perfectly & cut through the heat quite nicely -rrb- . filet mignon on cibatta was interesting : diced , served with avocado , but the downer was that it suppose to be served with pomme frittes , but it came with like frito lay ripple chips - kinda really ruined the presentation - big time . italian coffee - o ya . chocolate mint grenache nauche torte ? heaven , i 'm in heaven ... the half point demerit , or star - wait a minute - u cant do that here !!! if i could , i would - the incessant pounding and banging in the kitchen !! they were tenderizing meat almost the entire time here - grrrr - it 's a very tiny place , so yes , we could definitely hear it . alot . that said , it was a great afternoon . very special . but certainly not in the pocket book to frequent again in the very near future . next business dinner i would love to suggest the private dinning room & lounge for sure !		5		1
one of my favorite places in scottsdale to grab some pad thai or shoji noodles and a thai iced tea . the place is set back in a strip mall setting . when you walk in you will notice the love of elephants because they are everywhere . the restaurant is kind of quiet but the service has always been excellent . i love that there is so many different asian cuisines to choose from . i had a taste of their roger roll the last time i was there and was happy with the quality of sushi although not a large variety but still a good menu . the staff was very accommodating for my sister who is a vegetarian too . this is a great place to have a quiet intimate meal , business meeting , or group get together .		5		1
can bread and butter really be opulent ? i just found the answer to my question . yes . the bread is smooth , soft , warm and perfectly cooked -lrb- crunchy and soft -rrb- . the `` white bread '' is actually an asiago roll roll with a crunchy top . we then moved on to the gazpacho which was a perfect blend of coolness and hidden heat . it was a wonderful teaser for all the other flavors to come . the specials looked incredible , but we have some fellow foodies that raved about the mussels and the short ribs . the mussels had a sweetness that i have never experienced with mussels . it was star anise and while it was a bit perplexing it kept me coming back for more . my wife and i were supposed to share , but she really did n't want to share her mussels . the short ribs were wonderfully flavorful and perfectly cooked . normally in a restaurant you often experience a great main dish with some weak accompaniments . this was not the case . the mashed potatoes , sauce and beans were exquisite . the ambiance , service and vibe were topped of the experience . we did n't bring our daughter with us , but we were very impressed with the kids menu . we will bring her next time . this will be our new regular hang out .		5		1
without question the best restaurant experience of my life . period , end of story . went here for restaurant week -lrb- which is a huge bargain compared to what they normally charge -rrb- . the restaurant week menu was a 4 course tasting -lrb- which is actually more like 9 or 10 tastings -rrb- . i 'm normally not one for tiny portions , but the flavors are so powerful and the pace of the tastings was so perfect that i was never hungry -lrb- but at the same time never completely full -rrb- . from the bacon chips to the ginger lemon cocktail to the lamb -lrb- oh , the lamb -rrb- , to the brioche bread and multiple chocolate dessert tastings , everything was incredible . tremendous service by the staff as they walked us through the entire menu of items , but were n't intrusive at all . bottomline , all the hype you 've heard about this place is true and then some . kevin binkley has created a culinary wonder and keeps you guessing at every turn . i 'd eat here regularly if i could . but i 'll settle for what was not only my best restaurant week experience of all time , but my favorite restaurant experience of all time . hands down .		5		1
this a review highlighting flemings event hosting skills - i had a luncheon/seminar here on yesterday and was thoroughly impressed with both the outstanding quality of food and excellent service . flemings was closed to the public during this event because they open at dinner hours . although the restaurant was not officially opened all of the employees still kept the same level of service as if it was ; as a matter of fact i was graciously greeted by a hostess upon arrival . the actual meeting room was sectioned off in the rear of the restaurant , this would make a great place for any after wedding rehearsal dinner , seminar/luncheon , or even possibly an upscale bridal shower . the wait staff was very friendly moved stealthily to each table during the seminar which is very important -lrb- nobody wants to hear a bunch of plates clinking when you 're trying to listen to a presentation -rrb- . on to the food ! the salad was pre-chosen by the host which was fresh mozzarella & sweet cherry tomato - one word to describe it would be `` amazing '' ! the tomatoes were perfectly sweet and paired so well with the creamy fresh mozzarella , i literally thought about this dish when i was on my way to sleep for the night . for dinner attendees at the seminar had the choice of chicken , salmon and of course steak . my co-workers and i all decided to try something different so we could compare . i had the chicken and was impressed by juiciness and the mushroom chutney it was served with . the salmon looked delectable and received high praise as well as the petite filet mignon . all the entrees came with fresh sautéed green beans and fleming 's potatoes -lrb- think of the best scallops you 've ever eaten , now times that greatness by 10 and you 'll have fleming 's potatoes -rrb- . the seminar concluded with a cheesecake that was sent straight from the cheesecake gods -lrb- it was a huge piece and i was already full but i somehow made room for it ! -rrb- . the cheesecake was rich , creamy and lightly topped with blueberries -lrb- i ca n't believe i had to go back to work after that feast ! -rrb- . this was my first time at fleming 's i will be sure to come back during normal operating hours so i can try even more of the amazing menu . bravo chef and staff !		5		1
excellent food , excellent service , great wine list and a great happy hour . the $ 1 louisiana oysters on the half shell are a hard appetizer to turn down . the fish can come simply grilled and their grouper is the freshest i have enjoyed in the west ! the ambiance is really nice and there 's valet parking or free self park downstairs . after all we ate and drank , i was glad to have self-parked as i `` sort of exercised '' walking back to the car . eddie v 's has a really pretty interior and was well though-out . i love the glass wine display and the wine list is equally as impressive . this is a must try , special occasion place with live music . folks are generally dressed up , but i was admitted in jeans . great spot and i look forward to coming back !		5		1
yeah ! kickass asian fast food ! no `` bobo plates '' , no little sterno grill to burn your own food , no 70s `` oriental '' restaurant ambiance . this is the real thing . just knock your socks off , fresh asian cuisine to please many palates . want veggie ? there 's lots of vegetarian options for you made to order and brought to your table fast . chinese ? sure . japanese ? that too . they even have pho and curry plates . you 'll get a satisfying mound of food for $ 10 including bottomless drink . my only caveat : do n't bother having a big conversation with the person you may be eating with -- this place is loud . that 's okay -- you 'll have too much fun eating to want to talk that much . look , i 'm from the sf bay area , where asian joints abound . this place would totally outdo a lot of the spots back home if it were in the bay . best asian spot so far that i 've been to in the valley . if there 's a better one , i have yet to find it . go . eat . stuff thyself .		5		1
dairy does not agree with my belly , but sometimes i just have to `` man-up '' and `` go for it '' because `` it is what it is '' . cece g said it best ... it is highly recommended to bring a friend and order 1 thing -lrb- unless it 's just a scoop -rrb- . otherwise , you will be jabbing yourself multiple times with an emergency diabetes pen . the ice cream servings are huge , and i could n't finish my 2 scoops of almond praline and rocky road . although both were equally decadent and rich and oh so tasty . my wife had the mint chip with hot fudge and i 'm not a big fan of mint ice cream , however , upon tasting hers , it was very , very tasty . my sis-in-law bested me and finished her 2 scoops , but now she is laid out on the couch in stretchy pants . a great place in old town ... it epitomizes the vision of yesteryear when i 'm sure scottsdale was a bit more romantic and innocent . i hope it stays around for many more `` 50 year '' anniversaries .		5		1
i frequently travel all the way from gilbert just to eat here . 35 miles of driving which has always been well worth it . i 've tried the one in mesa but i do n't find it to be as good as the original . they have amazing new mexican style cuisine . i do love it spicy though , and they 're the spiciest mexican food i 've ever had . they do have a lot of non spicy stuff too . out of town guests i 've taken , who are n't into anything spicy , have found it to be very good . i think the milder part of the menu have been just as appetizing , sometimes moreso because you 're not sweating bullets and downing 5 glasses of water just to make the burn go away . you can wait a long time for a table , so be prepared to wait , but if you go during off times , like after the lunch crowd or right before the dinner crowd you should n't have a wait . the margaritas will kick your ass too . get a pitcher and make it a day drinking , hotter than hell mexican extravaganza .		5		1
i would give this place a 4.5 star rating , if possible . when we come to town from san diego , we try new restaurants that are highly rated on yelp . this one deserves the high star rating . we rarely go back to the same restaurant but ate there 2 out of the 3 nights we were in scottsdale . the first night we had their fresh burratta -lrb- from sicily -rrb- , sicilian olives , greek olives , large tomatoes , basil and wonderful olive oil that is from tuscany and gets bottled under their label . my partner had lamb shank -lrb- osso bucco style -rrb- over milanese risotto with rich veal sauce - yummy ! i had homemade squash ravioli with four cheese sauce . we ended up having panna cotta with berries and they provided complimentary sambuca with three espresso beans . the bread and olive oil were delicious also . all in all , the food was excellent and so was the service . the second night we sat at the bar and was served by deborah -lrb- owner 's daughter -rrb- and met her father , leonardo . great family . we decided we wanted to try everything so we had four appetizers . carpaccio with parmesean cheese , capers , tomatoes , olive oil ; gnocci -lrb- iighter than a cloud -rrb- in a cream sauce with a spoon full of marinara ; burrata -lrb- same as the first night but it was double the size the next day -rrb- ; and the best mussels i 've ever had -lrb- spicy marinara sauce or you have your choice of white wine/garlic or tomato sauce -rrb- . the stuff was like crack and my boyfriend practically licked the bowl . my boyfriend loves limoncello so deborah made him a limonello martini and then provided complimentary limoncello after dinner . the tiramisu - the lightest i have every had . the service is excellent and the food is awesome ! i would definitely go back . some yelpers did n't like the strip mall location . who cares as long as the restaurant is nice inside , which this one fits that description . owners are awesome and describe the food so vividly .		5		1
i give richardson 's 5 stars for their breakfast ! we go here all the time for breakfast/brunch on the weekends and almost always enjoy it thoroughly . note : i do not eat dinner there , as there is not much of a vegetarian selection besides their pizza . but back to their fabulous breakfasts ... i absolutely love their enchiladas & eggs dish . i normally order my eggs fried over medium , which are then set atop cheese enchiladas covered in chile -lrb- get the red if you 're vegetarian -rrb- . the red chile is made just right , with the perfect amount of spiciness & flavor . the dish also comes served with delicious beans & potatoes . the huevos rancheros are also damn good & are my number 2 pick . the service is typically great . on one visit with some friends , we ordered a few prickly pear margaritas to start the day off right . when the drinks arrived and they did n't even look purple , we complained and our waiter happily brought us some extra prickly pear juice . on another occasion , my girlfriend ordered a bloody mary . bloody mary 's come with a shot of mexi-beer . when we were casually chatting with our waiter and told him that we did n't like that type of beer , he swapped it out with a chimay shot for free ! we love the food and they always treat us right , so we 'll keep coming back .		5		1
i have defected from the tempe library system ! since one of my favourite things to do in the whole wide world is to ride the green belt from tempe beach park to scottsdale civic center early in the morning on a weekday -lrb- to avoid all the strollers , weekend warriers , and random frisbees to the head -rrb- , i had run out of exhibits to see at smoca , could only spend 20 bucks for a beer and a sandwich at orange table , run out of movies to view at camelview and i was too gross and sweaty to walk around all the off-duty stripper moms , i had to find another resting place . this library provides : a nice bike rack , clean large bathrooms with huge shelving inside and nice cold water fountains , the latest magazines -lrb- whether vibe , economist , art in america , tiger beat -rrb- to sit with and rehydrate in a large soft brown chair up against the large windows to brose through . but more magic happens here-i really do love to read -lrb- try to average 2 a week , more if possible -rrb- and i kept finding in the new book section all the books i 've been wanting . i went online to find books i didnt see on the shelf -lrb- their vegan cookbook sections was a little wanting -rrb- , and they had tons of vegan options so i started placing holds-and i got an email telling me when it was ready , a space reserved for me to grab it and self check it . but then i wanted more . like i read nyt and magazines , see a book i want and ask them to buy it . and you know what ? they do . i ask them and they do it ! they are the daddy warbucks of book-buying ! their dvd selections is solid , and you can watch them online ala netflix on-demand , and there is no judging for renting bride wars when you self check . you can also rate the books online like amazon , search , put in carts and reserve online . when i have needed human beings -lrb- i had lost a book and it cost a lot more than 14 cans to save that debt -rrb- for fine payment plan , looking for books or general questions , i have always been pleased by their professional manner , and a nice guy there gave me the scottsdale key chain card too ! tempe on southern and rural just has not enough awesome art shows like the coral crochet reef project that is up right now , and not enough graphic novels on demand . a booknerd just ca n't so no to a library that buys her just about any book she desires !		5		1
visited windsor last night for the 1st time . excellent ! love this place ! it 's got a good urban bistro atmosphere . seating inside or out . it was friday a little after 5:00 p.m. and the place was packed . the wait for a table was n't long and both the bartender and server were very good . our beers -lrb- stella artois on draft -rrb- were cold and refreshing . we started with the loaded chips with bacon and they were so darn tasty ! i had the brown bag chicken sandwich since someone here on yelp recommended it -lrb- thanks jessica w. -rrb- . sandwich was large and the chicken was so tender . my side was kale salad -lrb- never had kale salad before but now i 'm hooked -rrb- . husband had the crab cake sandwich . he said it was excellent and his cole slaw was the best ! i ca n't wait to go back ! good job windsor ... see you soon . did i mention you can eat at the bar ? good place for people watching and you can also see the chefs hustling back in the kitchen .		5		1
al-hana is the cafe located inside the baiz market that serves amazingly genuine middle eastern provisions ... this according to my fiancee who hails from michigan , worked in a middle eastern restaurant while going to msu , and considers it her favorite cuisine . wrap that into one giant grape leaf , and you have one crazed middle eastern food enthusiast . we went here to pick up a few groceries and some take-out from the small cafe tucked in the front corner of the market . i had already called ` dibs ' on the chicken shawarma while on the short car-ride to east-central phoenix , and i fist-pumped in her face to let her know i just shook her down . um , no worries for her because she dominated the rest of that menu , ordering a falafel sandwich -lsb- in pita -rsb- , za'atar bread -lsb- dipped in labne purchased at the back deli -rsb- , and six veggie grape leaf rolls . lunch + leftovers = $ 20 . all of it was fresh , delicious , and enormously stirring . their blends of spices and dips are phenomenal . i considerably recommend al-hana as a quick stop for genuine m.e. grub .		5		1
this has been the best food event each year for the past 2 years . it 's nicely set up , however this year was more crowded than the last . the range of food is always a plus , however many restaurants served small soft tacos which end up just blending together in my memory . my favorite part of the event are the cooking demos given by chefs of well known restaurants . the chefs do a great job explaining the process of the dish they are cooking and it 's definitely a nice break from the endless eating that can go on at an event like this . i loved relish burger 's kobe beef burgers , so much so that i will probably try them out at the restaurant in the near future . different pointe of view served lobster ravioli with a delicious cream sauce . i was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the arizona wineries which were on hand .		5		1
i had a great time at sapporo ! went here for the first time on a friday night and the place was packed . to be honest , the scenery is a little too overwhelming with all of the fire fountain things , the gigantic lantern thing in the center and the cougars and lurking men . i 'm more of a laid back , whole in the wall type . but the service is what made the difference for us . the wait would have been 45 + min which would have been fine , but a waitress at the bar held a corner bar table for us while closing the tab for her previous custs . we were seated within 10 min . average people like us getting vip treatment was awesome ! i 'm an asian that likes americanized sushi i guess , because i loved the scottsdale and salmon tempura maki . the sashimi was delicate and not too fatty either . the curry mussels did n't seem japanese at all , but it had a good taste and the bread was even tasty . it could have been all of the sapporos and apple sangrias , but overall , i had a fabulous time with the company and the food . as busy as it was , the service was top notched too .		5		1
what a sweet little place ! it really is beautiful , large outdoor patio . the interior has a giant roll up door that allows you to sit outside , while being inside . decor is awesome , classy and makes you want to sit and spend some time . timo is a nice ride up central from the light rail stop at camelback and central . up the bridal trail and just past the canal -lrb- about 5 miles of nice riding -rrb- . which is awesome because they have a phenomenal wine list , excellent beer selection and some kick ass non-acoholic drinks ! they have a wood fired oven which they use to make their own bread , and toast the sandwiches -lrb- if you think this is similar to what quiznos does ... i am speechless ... please stop reading . -rrb- . the bread is delightful and the sandwiches will last two meals ! appetizer menu is absolutely delectable , so many things i could n't decide . went with a simple olive tampenade , it was stellar ! the menu is surprisingly affordable considering the ingredients , quality and decor . if this place were 10 miles east it 'd be double the price ! not that i want the prices to go up , i was delighted . run , bike , walk , drive , if you must , ... go and check it out .		5		1
i fear that this place is going to get out of hand very shortly . please people keep to matt 's big breakfast and over easy keep the crowds away . ok ok i ca n't be selfish but i wish i could this place is awesome . everything from the japanese cold brew coffee to the espresso 's to the amazing food . i have had the pain perdu which is bannana bread french toast fresh bannanas sliced on top and a whiskey caramel sauce on top and the savory crepes with chicken and egg inside and a homemade sauce over the top . both dishes were amazing i will for sure go back just for those , but will have to try the rest of the menu first . i am very greatful i have monday and tuesday 's off to avoid the weekend crowds because i am sure they will be starting very soon .		5		1
favorite place for a mai tai : hula 's favorite place for a hamburger : hula 's stopped in for happy hour the other day and we sat at the bar -lrb- our first time doing so -rrb- we were a little confused when our mai tais came because they did n't have the dark rum floater ... figured they must have just mixed it . our guess was confirmed when we saw a bartender shake one up prior to serving . you can get yours `` unshaken '' if you ask for it . devoured our small order of sweet potato fries -lrb- always awesome -rrb- ... we almost ready to fight over the chance to lick the basket liner ! our hula burgers came and broke up the fight . they looked so incredible ! we were starving , but that is not why they looked so good . we each got the same burger -lrb- med . rare -rrb- , with blue cheese , but the mrs ordered a salad and i went with the slaw . we might have stopped to breath , but have no recollection . the hula burger is one of the best burgers in town . perfect shape , super tasty and super juicy . the bun and onions are a perfect match . the burger was the main event for about 4 minutes ... the world went on unnoticed by us . even the cool beach movie with a super young , pre orange george hamilton became a blur . i almost always try slaw when it is on the menu as a side . usually i am disappointed . it is either not that good , or really good but comes in a micro bowl tablespoon serving . why ? it is cabbage ? best slaw in town : hula 's not only was it delicious , it was a more of a family reunion buffet-like serving . yeah ! another thing ... try the hinano beer . good stuff ! the mrs. is planning to have one of book club meeting there for brunch one time ... i might tag along and see if i can get a burger ! ... maybe i can get that as a loco moco !		5		1
i do n't really like italian food ... there , i said it , it 's true . you can begin submitting your hate mail . when anyone asks the question , `` what do you want to eat ? '' italian will rarely , if ever , come out of my mouth . however , that may have been changed by north frattoria italiana . many of my phoenix yelp friends have been to and speak highly of north . i just realized that i can literally walk there from my home . at times , i 'm completely oblivious to my surroundings . all this time , north has been sitting here , and i have n't taken advantage of it . well , today that has all changed . we came here tonight because my offspring loves italian food ... he may not actually be mine . i 'm kidding , he 's mine , bought and paid for . the first thing i noticed about north was the setting . unlike the typical mamma mia ... ay you 's guys ... ooh la la -lrb- actually i think that last one 's french -rrb- atmosphere , north has a farm house feel . the staff was even wearing plaid shirts and jeans . i liked that laid back feel . i 'm a country boy at heart so the farm-esque tone was comforting . we started our food journey with the calamari and a seasonal chef board : the calamari was okay . the breading was a bit heavy and i thought it took away from the flavor and feel of the calamari . it 's not something i would get again . the seasonal chef board was good . it consisted of brussel sprouts , squash , asparagus , mushrooms , some kind of cheese and a few slices of really good bread . i liked it , but it was more for my lady . the veggies fixation is her thing . for my main dinner i got the ricotta gnocchi . it 's braised beef short rib with gnocchi served in a horseradish crema and wilted arugula . i love short rib , but i 'm not a huge fan of horseradish . i asked our server her opinion and she assured me it all complimented each other . she was absolutely right . it was excellent . the short rib was very tender and the crema , meat and gnocchi all worked perfectly . excellent . i could have ended the meal there and been content , but we did n't . for dessert we ordered the tiramisu and bombolini : the tiramisu is served in a glass container rather than in sliced cake form , and is covered in playful little chocolate balls . i liked the presentation . it was cool looking and tasted great . the bombolini are italian donuts . they had cinnamon and sugar on the surface and were plated on a lemon/vanilla mascarpone pudding-like bed . it all worked well together and my son , who is a bit of a `` donut expert '' , thought they were very good . overall , this was a wonderful experience . everyone walked away happy and i found an italian place that i could see myself frequenting ... for that , 5 stars is in order .		5		1
scratch is an uncanny experience . tucked away in a strip mall , next to a subway , there sits a wonderful french pâtisserie . and recently , they 've started serving dinner . it may seem a rather absurd notion that you could find amazing french cooking in a strip mall next to a subway , but duc liao has managed to deliver in spades . the fashion photographer met his fashion-model wife in paris and they jetted out to be closer to her mother , chasing a dream to start their own bistro . charming story aside , the food is absolutely amazing . i started with a wonderful buffalo mozzarella and tomato salad served with mixed greens and a wonderful balsamic vinaigrette served on the side . the cheese was fresh and delicious and the presentation was spot-on . i moved on to the brilliant stuffed chicken breast , with a wonderful mushroom and rosemary stuffing , with tarragon and other wonders , served in a delicious sauce with rice pilaf . absolutely incredible . my partners in crime had the french onion soup and the foie gras salad . the french onion was a monument to great soup , while the foie gras was simply an insane amount of foie gras served for $ 14 . my $ 12 chicken and the girlfriend 's $ 5.50 house red really kept things reasonable as well . as we were the last diners in there on a thursday night , duc came out from the kitchen and introduced himself , asking how we were enjoying ourselves . we discussed the lamb that girlfriend was eating and he lit up when she mentioned that medium rare is the best way to go . he began discussing his specialty lamb dish , but said that it typically requires 2-3 people at least to enjoy . he then invited us to call him and plan an evening around it , saying he 'd run out and grab the special ingredients necessary and set to the four hour cooking process early in the day for us if we gave him due warning . our other companion struck up a conversation on his own attempts with pastry and duc walked him through some of the challenges and tips and tricks of the trade . the entire experience was absolutely incredible , and i ca n't wait to celebrate there very soon with our own special herb lamb offering , cooked up just for us by duc , who absolutely insisted two or three times that we just give him a call and ask . our server howard was also friendly and fast and helpful and knowledgeable ; all good things for a waiter . the experience as a whole was already spot-on , but interacting with the co-owner/chef was a treat and a privilege and i ca n't wait to bring my other foodie friends back for more . -lrb- oh , and the dome chocolate hazelnut craziness that i had was incredible as well . -rrb- absolutely wonderful , and worth it in every way . dress casual or dress up a bit , but do n't expect any pretentiousness here . it 's just amazing , simple , delicious food served by great people who clearly love their craft .		5		1
this is one of those places where you question `` are we really supposed to be here ?! '' but once enter pizza a , you know you made the right decision . it is a small venue , maybe seats 40 people tops but is a great place to sit and grab a slice . my go tos are the meatball pizza and also the pizza with prosciutto and arugula . the website is n't working night now otherwise i would find the name . i love that you can get a regular pie or even get `` the metro , '' a meter of pizza . someday i will do something so that i an order a true metro pizza but until that day . i will just order the regular pie . if you have a large 6 + part call ahead to make sure they have space because the place is pretty small but they def do n't skimp on flavor !		5		1
it is extremely necessary that i update my review ... this is about the atmosphere and hospitality that i received last night . while it is true that i was there with a friend who is a regular there , the staff could n't have been more personable and engaging to me . antonio and robert -lrb- i so hope i got the names right ! -rrb- treated me like they had known me forever , which gave me that warm and fuzzy feeling inside . my pinot grigio was chilled just right . i would love to try one of cork 's wine dinners sometime , since all i hear are rave reviews about it . i am going to write another update on saturday when i go back there to try some yummy quiche . : -rrb-		5		1
could i have actually found a reason to update my yogurtology review for a 3rd time ? oh , yes ... i have ! the recently updated their register system and replaced the old-school stamp cards with a handy-dandy key-fob tracker . now , if you are ridiculously unorganized like me , you wo n't lose your frequent yogurt-shopper card . yay ! i 'm pretty sure i have found a new favorite flavor . key lime pie . oh , my ... how have i missed this on previous visits ? it is phenomenal ! if only it could be served side-by-side in yogurt-heaven-swirlyness with coconut ... then , i could die happy . please , oh , please make this happen , dear yogurt gods . only one * tiny * tip - can we please get a facebook thing going ? a daily flavor update would be so easy , and would make it much easier for me to plan my visits .		5		1
stopped in here for lunch today with robyn n. & mike c. i see that most are only giving this one 4 stars , but i loved my burger & onion rings & do n't really see how it could have been any better ! you get to put on all of your own toppings , & there were plenty to choose from , so that 's on you ! the bun was large , soft & fresh , the burger patty was tasty & you had a choice of four sizes up to one pound -lrb- ! -rrb- . the onion rings were crisp & delicious ... much better than the ones at ted 's that everyone raves about , i think ! so -lrb- yes i know you ca n't start a paragraph with `` so '' -rrb- , i thought it was right up there with smashburger & the other premium burger places around the valley ! not only that , the menu here is extensive , with lots of tempting things to try on repeat visits , such as burgers of elk , boar & buffalo , just for starters . yum ! : -- rrb - -rrb- 1/2 lb . fudd 's prime burger $ 5.89 , onion rings $ 2.79		5		1
big stars for frank and lupe not banning me for life . after knocking not one but three drinks on the ground , all three producing shards of broken negro modelo glass , one would think they 'd send a goon squad over to whisk my winter beer festival attending ass out the door , throwing me into the street like the town drunk in some old western movie . nope . what did they do ? instead , they bring me replacement drinks free of charge . go figure . like i needed any more beer , right ? i suggest ordering the # 4 combination dinner . i managed to get a couple bites , -lrb- which was pretty damned tasty -rrb- but most of it wound up on my white polo shirt . weird how white attracts large amounts of mexican food . i looked like an art-deco work in progress . frank and lupe , you have a really nice establishment . your food -lrb- what i can remember of it -rrb- is tasty , and your servers are super polite , but you really should have banned me for life , or at the very least , called the police on me or something . anyways , i 'm going to do you guys a big favor and self-impose a `` banned-for-life '' on me . it 's the least i can do to return the favor . btw , we were both lucky i found your receipt in my cargo shorts this morning , otherwise i 'd never know the name of the place to ban myself from .		5		1
you should consider this an update of my review of the yelp event at citizen 's public house . http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=v-gcier8vr9jnmkkr5uq_a&q=citizen%27s+public+house ever since the amazing drinks we had at the yelp event i 've wanted to go back to citizen 's public house . so we stopped in tonight , our 23rd wedding anniversary , after dinner at a french restaurant we wanted to try . richie moe , mixologist extraordinare and my drink hero was busy so his apprentice , chris , made me an amazing drink . but richie knew we wanted a taste of his magic so when he was free , he came by . he remembered me and yelper shannon m and how much we enjoyed our drinks . when he learned it was my and jim w 's anniversary he offered us anniversary shots , saying he felt like lighting something on fire . oh my god !!! he started out with these two stainless steel pitchers - way too big for a couple of shots . he put in chopped chocolate , added chocolate liqueur and banana liqueur and heated the bottom of the pot . he then gently caught the contents on fire . that 's when the real excitement began . he poured flaming liqueur from one pot to the other . back and forth went the flaming lava-like stream , a brilliant blue and gold . when he was done he poured it into two shot glasses , added some sort of cream and grated chocolate on the top . it was warm , a perfect temperature to drink . and it tasted like a liqueur version of bananas foster . it was fantastic !!! i 'd been wanting to go back since presidents day . richie reminded us why . chris is well on his way to being an amazing mixologist as well . you need to find out why too . go now . what are you waiting for ?!		5		1
you guys have no idea how long i debated whether or not to leave a review for little woody . it was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as i possibly could , mostly because the place is n't that big , i live across the street , and i appreciate at least a foot of personal space . welp , that foot of personal space is almost gone now so i figure it 's about the time to profess my love for this not-really-a-dive bar , especially since they just added the most amazing back room a bar has ever had . seriously , i could set up a cot , eat , drink , and sleep in that back room and have absolutely no problems in life . they have shuffleboard , darts , and skeeball ! really , what more can you ask for ? in my original review of the great escape -lrb- r.i.p. , gone but not forgotten -rrb- , i concluded with `` if they had shuffleboard , i 'd bump them up to 5 stars '' ... little woody did me one better and got shuffle board while simultaneously getting rid of that weird old person basement smell the place used to have -lrb- and replacing it with the lovely smell of wood -rrb- . what really makes this bar though is that everyone is seriously so freaking friendly . once a guy asked me to punch him in the stomach ... super friendly because i love punching people . another time we sat down at a random table and played a game of rcl with a group of complete strangers , obviously awesome . one stranger let me play with his iphone 5 the day it came out just because i noticed it . i 've only been mean-mugged like once and those girls clearly got lost looking for mint , so that 's not the wood 's fault . all in all , i love this bar , i can now loudly declare that i love this bar , and if you want to come and be cool and love this bar with me you can . just leave the mean-mugging in old town .		5		1
amazing is all i have to say about this place ... the end ! okay , i have to rant on about this place , it 's delicious !! i was looking for a location that served the best of the best for pizza and saw spinato 's come up . the service here was exceptional and our waiter was soooo nice ! we started off with a salad and i had the raspberry vinaigrette which was awesome . we also had the medium thin crust pizza topped with extra cheese , spinach , and ham ... amazing !! to end the meal we had to try the desserts so we shared a holy cannoli and brownie bella which both were mouth watering and a must have . i will be going back to this place , although that wait was longer than expected and the waiting area was hot ! it was all well worth the wait . : -rrb-		5		1
what i bought : i purchased a mid-century wooden bench , a mid-century liquor cabinet , two minimalist wooden chairs , and a funky painting called dancing monsters . quality of the product : spectacular . my fiance and i love everything that we bough from here . the owner 's taste in furniture is a little funky and classic , which is exactly what we are looking for ! 10 out of 10 . customer service : i always forget her name , but she is bar far the best owner of any retail store up and down 7th ave. she has great suggestions and is always extremely friendly when we show up . and another plus , she is a huge animal lover ... we adopted three cats from the animal shelter she volunteers at it . 10 out of 10 . value : the price were fair and reasonable . i would n't say it was a steal , but i figured that both sides came away with a pretty honest and worthwhile deal . 10 out of 10 . overall : go-kat-go my fiances and my first stop when we go to 7th ave. the friendly customer service , the selection , and the prices make this place a winner . 30 out of 30 , 5 out of 5 stars .		5		1
after living here for 6years , hana is the best sushi i 've had in phoenix , period . in fact , it 's so good , i will not eat sushi anywhere else now . now , let me give you some context so you may determine if this review is for you : do you dip your rice in soy sauce ? do you add `` wasabi '' to your soy sauce ? do you eat rolls other than basic seaweed , rice , fish ? do you think the green paste is wasabi ? do you call the fish part of the nigiri , `` sushi '' ? if you said yes to any of the above -lrb- do n't lie -rrb- , this review is not for you . otherwise , read on ... hamachi kama was brilliant ; perfectly cooked and delicious . yellowtail handroll was utterly amazing . the yellowtail handroll is my go-to . at hana the fish was melt-in-your-mouth fresh and had the perfect fish to rice ratio which is extremely important . i also tried the halibut , striped bass , crab , masago with quail egg , and salmon . all the fish was the freshest , best tasting i have eaten since moving from los angeles . the sunomono was even amazing ! help-wise , the service was spot-on . extremely friendly and very attentive . i ca n't say enough good things about this place . disclaimer : i have yet to try yasu , which i hear is amazing as well , but compared to every other sushi joint in phoenix , this is the spot to go to . f everywhere else .		5		1
new favorite brunch spot !!!! wifey took me here for father 's day brunch yesterday and it did not disappoint ! first off , they have $ 5 cocktails , pitchers of beer and mary 's ! they have a traditional bloody mary and my fave , the verde mary ! think green salsa with vodka ... but in the best way possible !!! they also have a set up inside where you can customize your mary with 10-15 different types of pickled goodies , tons of different hot sauces , salts and seasonings . the ultimate mary bar ! i also had this breakfast dish with cheesy mashed potatoes on the bottom , a crisp tortilla covered with two over easy eggs and salsa that was the quintessential arizona breakfast . just awesome ! great service as well !		5		1
we got to introduce 3 `` virgins '' to the wonders of pam tonight - and they all agreed it was tremendous and fabulous . the gnocchi was pillowy and perfect , the saltimbocca was tender and rich , the mussels were fat and flavorful , the carbonara was snatched from its orderer and devoured by his girlfriend who loved what she ordered until she tasted his . the bread was great , as always , and the tapenade bowl was scraped clean . the calamari fritti was light and fresh , and one friend exclaimed that the accompanying marinara was the best she 'd ever had . even though they live in east mesa , they 'll be returning for sure . i think those of us who are regulars were concerned when maurizio left to open amarone . after all , he was such a big part of the charm and ambiance of the place . let me tell you , the new gm michael more than fills his shoes . charming ? you bet . awesome accent ? check . kind , accommodating , cool under pressure ? yes , yes , yes . remembers you and your problems with tomatoes ? always . tonight , i also brought in a cheesecake i had made for my friend -lrb- her favorite , and she now lives out of state -rrb- and without missing a beat , michael offered to put it in the walk-in , even brought it out with candles , then took it back and served it to us on plates he decorated as if it were his own dessert . i was so impressed with his generosity . that 's the kind of service and small town feel you get at pizza a metro . as long as we live here and the place is open , we 'll continue to be regulars .		5		1
being breakfast lovers and especially lovers of local owners and fresh ingredients , we acted upon a few suggestions from people who we have come to know as wonderfully accurate about good places to eat : local chefs ! believing that peer-reviewed places are likely to be excellent , peg and i checked out this place this am . the place was '' über crowded , but shelby greeted us cordially and gave us the info and layout of the land . we knew that we wanted to sample both savory and sweet ... and we are both coffee lovers as well . . meaning lovers of good coffee !! heart coffee was wonderful . i had the sausage | local pork ~ pimento cheese ~ roasted fingerling ~ easy egg crepe , and my bride sampled the papa k | local ham ~ mushroom ragoût ~ pepperjack ~ dressed greens crepe . they were extraordinarily tasty . we did the usual sharing bites , and ended the meal with two sweet crepes : lemon x 3 | butter + gel + zest and ^ vanilla bean custard | strawberries -lrb- straight up -rrb- ... meaning you can add other goodies to the custard if you wish . as importantly , the service and attitude of the people working there was stellar . shelby was very attentive and helpful -lrb- checking to make sure that our seating arrangement was acceptable -rrb- and brittney -lrb- i apologize in advance if there is a different spelling of your name !!! -rrb- and the server in the very nice `` miles '' -lrb- as in miles davis -rrb- were on top of things . the background music is a wonderful addition . all in all , this place is definitely worth a repeat/repeat/repeat visit !!! btw . . it is literally next door to pcroissant ... another excellent choice . dr. b		5		1
this place is absolutely , positively perfect in every conceivable way . why , you ask , is this place perfect in every conceivable way ? well ... my friends ... let me tell you . 1 . big kahuna cab/shiraz mix wine - it costs three dollars and it is good . like , i drink it all the time good . three dollars ! 2 . cilantro lime hummus - you could dip paper in this and it would still be nectar of the gods . still . 3 . no bullshit approach - you walk in , you get your shit , and you check yourself out . i 'm not anti-social , but i really do n't like dealing with people , so this is perfect for me . 4 . they have exactly what you need , and nothing more . 5 . the clearance section is abundant . i 'm a cheap bastard ; what can i say ? 6 . this f & e is literally 2 minutes from my house . they close at 10pm , so when you are baking #thepie -lrb- vegan style richard !!!! -rrb- at 9:55 pm at night and realize you are out of pecans , you can scoot on over , grab your nuts , and be back home by 10:01 pm . 7 . ummm ... duh , its fresh and its easy .		5		1
i went to chicago gyros with my husband , brother , and sister tonight based solely on the reviews on yelp . i am happy to say that this place rocks ! one awesome thing is that they offer `` normal food '' -lrb- sister 's description -rrb- such as burgers , hot dogs , fish and chips , and chicken strips as well as mediterranean food . we got the vegetarian platter -lrb- appetizer -rrb- so the youngins could try something mediterranean without committing to a full meal that they were convinced they would n't like . the platter includes two different types of hummus , pita bread , dolmas , and falafel . everyone tried the hummus and agreed it was `` ok '' or `` i 've had better '' -lrb- me -rrb- ... the pita bread was loved by all . the dolmas were scorned by the kids since they were - gasp ! - green and slimy-looking . the husband and i tried them - we did n't love them , but we would try them again . the falafel were determined to be just okay - they were a little on the greasy side and i 'm not sure if that is how they are supposed to be ... ? husband and i got the chicago gyros . this is were this restaurant goes from two stars -lrb- more on that below -rrb- to four and a half stars . the meat was perfectly seasoned , moist , the pita was the perfect texture , and the sauce was delicious . perfection when eaten with the meat and pita . i have eaten a lot of gyros and this is one the best tzatziki sauce i 've ever had . the service . the guy behind the counter earned the nickname from my group of mr. no personality / mr. no smile . seriously , he never smiled . i cracked jokes , i complimented the gyros , i did n't even get a twitch of a smile or acknowledgment that i had spoken . the cook , on the other hand , smiled and thanked me while mr. np/ns continued to ignore me . whatever - the perfection that is their gyro is almost enough to make up for him ... he keeps them from a perfect score , so the final score is : 4-1/2 stars .		5		1
the capital grill - phoenix location 2505 e. camelback road -lrb- 602-rrb - 952-8900 we arrived for our reservation at 4:30 and were promptly seated . our waitress was friendly and attentive . we began with cocktails - a chocolate martini made without godiva liquor and a mai tai . the chocolate martini was sent back and was promptly replaced with a correct one made with godiva chocolate . we quickly dove into the appetizers . steak tartare and lobster bisque . the steak tartare was arguably the finest i have ever eaten , and i have eaten this dish perhaps 40 or 50 times . the texture and seasoning were complete perfection . were i to return to this restaurant with the ability to order only one thing off the menu , this would be it . perfectly balanced with capers that were n't too salty , and some wonderful greens with a drizzle of what appeared to be and tested like an aged balsamic . companion had good comments about the lobster bisque , especially the fact that there was more than one piece of lobster in the dish . the bisque is brought to the table with a serving of sherry which is ceremoniously poured into the dish . personally , i prefer the sherry added at the end of the cooking so that the flavor remains , but the alcohol does not . the menu at the capital grill is similar to other high end restaurants , in that all main courses are a la carte . be warned , portions are huge , and unless you are a dyed in the wool carnivore , you will bring home a doggy bag . after perusing the menu and changing our minds a dozen times , we settled on the steak au poivre and the delmonico steak . i asked for the steak au poivre to be cooked rare , and that is exactly what i got . perfectly cooked with a courvoisier crème sauce . the sauce was nothing to rave about , in that it added nothing to the flavor of the steak . the steak though , was perfect and huge . i will make at least one more meal out of it . as a side dish i ordered roasted seasoned mushrooms , perhaps the only poor selection on the menu . the mushrooms were without any seasoning at all - not even a pinch of fleur de sel or a touch of garlic or even some chopped shallots . our waitress told us that they had been taken off our check , but looking at it after we left , we found that we had still been charged for them . companion had the delmonico steak -lrb- rib steak for those not in the know , and usually considered one of the most flavorful cuts of beef -rrb- served medium rare . if nothing else , the chef cooks meat to perfection . a huge cut of prime beef , tender and juicy . it 's hard to go wrong with this recipe for success . companion also ordered cottage fries and onion strings . a table of four would have had trouble finishing a portion the size of what was brought to the table . as with almost everything else , beautifully done . we saved room for dessert , and i for one am glad i did . while companion had a scoop of vanilla ice cream , which was nice and tasty and served with a tuile cookie -lrb- pirouine perhaps -rrb- , i chose the fresh berries in vanilla crème sauce . lush , succulent raspberries , blueberries and strawberries swimming in a nice crème anglais with a sprig of fresh mint on top . what could have been better ? a perfect end to our meal . dings ? a few - the mushrooms were terrible . i did n't finish eating them even though i love mushrooms . some of them were n't even cooked properly . the music is terrible - not only is it way out of style for the restaurant , but also way too loud . many times it intruded into the conversation , making it all but unintelligible . cudos ? first and foremost for our waitress , who helped make the meal so enjoyable . definitely for the meat and how it was cooked . absolutely for the steak tartare , which i am going to be dreaming about . and strangely enough , for the immaculately clean restroom , which is something that is too often neglected . overall : a top restaurant that i will definitely return to if only to have the steak tartare .		5		1
5 stars for the rf happy hour ! given the high quality of food and service at these prices , this must be the best bargain in town ! we came on a recommendation by a trusted friend who told us we had to order the green chile pork stew -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- . it came in a small iron kettle that kept the pork nice and hot . we were not disappointed - the pork was tender and succulent infused with layers of spicy flavors . we also ordered the fondue pot -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- which came with three 1-oz lamb chops , butternut squash and green apples for dunking . the cheese in the fondue tasted like a mild blend of cheddar and other american cheeses . the lamb chops were delicious on their own but just a touch over cooked at medium-well . the contrast of textures between the roasted squash and green apple cubes were great with the cheese . at the start of the meal , we also ordered the field green salad which came with candied pecans , sliced apples , diced beets and warm crusted round of goat cheese . i was pleasantly surprised to see the plate split for us even though it was only a $ 5 dish . the service was great - our water glasses were never less than half empty and our plates were quickly changed . happy hour wines are only $ 5 a glass . i ordered a red zinfandel and it was good to see the proper glass brought to me along with a small carafe of wine , allowing for the right pour to facilitate lots of swirling . it 's these small details that sets a restaurant apart . i do n't remember the last time i had this quality of a meal and service for less than $ 30 . we will most definitely be back and often .		5		1
do n't be fooled into thinking the arizona science center is just for kids . i 've been both with my nephew and with fellow `` big kids '' aka adults . every time i go , i have a blast and it 's not necessary to borrow your friend 's child in order to find an excuse to go . the science center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology , interactive exhibits and activities for all ages . during past visits , i 've enjoyed traveling exhibits like the titanic exhibit years ago . as you entered , they gave you a piece of paper with a name on it . as you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was . then at the very end , there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not . even though i was a history major in college , i learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in ! currently , they have an exhibit called `` forces of nature '' where you can learn about different weather patterns , climates and how weather happens . in the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively . i wo n't give it away , but you could get stuck in some rainy weather ! just recently , i was giving a super secret sneak peak into the brand new exhibit launching on 9/27 called `` all about me . '' they 've been working on this exhibit for at least a year if not longer and it certainly shows ! the amount of thought and energy they put into each exhibit is incredible and it 's an extremely dynamic experience . throughout the exhibit , i `` x-rayed '' a body and learned about different body parts , i entered a stomach and discovered the ins and outs of the digestive system -lrb- no pun intended -rrb- and there was even an intestine slide to take a ride down . i placed my hands hands on a censored area and a drum beat to the rate of my heart ! needless to say , the exhibit excited me and while i definitely am still a kid at heart , it was the adult in me who could n't wait to come back and explore some more . before i go , i want to share some other favorites that the science center offers ... the imax and adults night out ! they have a state of the art , full size imax theater on site and they show movies like under the sea . i am a big fan of the imax and have been swept away into different worlds many times here . adults night out is just that , where you can explore the exhibits , attend an imax show and have a fun night out sans any children ! i also heard a rumor that they might be bringing alcohol back during these nights ! let 's wait and see . : -rrb-		5		1
you know , after decades of different restaurant experiences from pasta just outside the vatican , antipasti in bologna , fish and chips in a london pub , haggis in edinburgh ... ... pierogies and kielbasa in chicago 's polish ` hood , seattle 's pike 's place , gilroy garlic festival , hatch chile fest ... i could go on and on ... sooooo ... roaring fork-if i had to pick a quintessential arizona restaurant , this would be it . it 's cowboy/southwest but just superbly prepared and served . the staff is more than accomodating , and everyone in our party just had the best experience . i 'm this . -lsb- read index finger and thumb about a quarter inch apart -rsb- . far from duplicating their green chile pork mwwwwwwwwahahaha !! : -rrb- seriously , this dish is killer and a must try !! t out !		5		1
i love having this place in my neighborhood , just a mere 800 steps from my front door . the menu appeals to everyone , from foodies to applebee 's addicts . it 's a unique spot that 's great for taking out of town visitors . service has been great the many times i 've come here . the restaurant is run efficiently , and the few times that we 've run into problems -lrb- like a burnt pizza -rrb- , the situation is remedied quickly . my dog once escaped and ran to joe 's -lrb- can you blame him ? -rrb- , and the manager was sweet enough to feed him chicken and watch over him until i could leave work to pick him up . i love that they added a veggie burger to the menu . it 's a good one , too ! it comes with a vegan 1000 island dressing , but i like to have it topped with the fixings from the fontina burger . their portobello burger is one of my favorites which says a lot because as a vegetarian , i 've eaten my body weight in `` token vegetarian option '' sandwiches . it has an awesome grilled flavor and is simply dressed . i love the grilled pizza too . no one near by does this , and the leftovers make an awesome breakfast . speaking of which , breakfast at joe 's farm grill is wonderful . my husband swears their pancakes are the best he 's ever had at a restaurant , very close to his mother 's version . he also goes gaga over the ribs and waffles -lrb- but a nap is required afterwards -rrb- and the breakfast tacos . i usually get the veggie scramble with a salad , grilled flatbread , and a great fruit cup that * does n't * include cheapo grapes and cantaloupe . lastly , i just have to say how happy i am that they finally took the endless loop of guy fieri off their tv monitors . good decision !		5		1
love . the building is great , minimal but in a comfy way and not overdone in an austere fussy kinda way . nice outdoor seating with a yummay fireplace ... like it here , did i mention that ?? service was attentive and friendly . i ordered the duck club and for a side told the waiter to surprise me . he brought me delicious french fries with light parmesan cheese and parsley and were to die for . the sandwich was similarly deiish . duck breast with a sweet , smoky tomato sauce and some applewood smoked bacon that were sandwiched between a soft , challah type roll that was a perfect foil for what was in the middle ; light and lucious and not too much bread . it 's in my work ` hood but not my neighborhood , even so , made an immediate report to the lovely : must go !!		5		1
fantastic meal last weekend ... only exceeded by the service . our server , lloyd , was put to the test with a table full of highly inebriated and hungry folks , and he passed with flying colors -lrb- or maybe it was the fireworks going on outside the restaurant -rrb- . our food was stunning , even though i was served the smallest kumumoto oysters i 've ever seen . three of us had fish and the other three had steaks . everyone was highly pleased with their meal , but again , lloyd stole the show with amazing service , a great sense of humor , and attention to detail . the six of us managed to get out of there for $ 600 before the tip , which i think is not too shabby given the $ 40 - $ 50 + per entree cost . the dungeness crab appetizer was one of my highlights and my blackened florida grouper was absolutely perfectly cooked to medium . i highly recommend this place for a special meal or for any celebration .		5		1
this place is off the hook ! i have eaten here many times and have loved everything i have tried . couple of things though : 1 . if you come here , expect to wait in line . there are no reservations so come early if you do n't want to wait or wait for a long time . 2 . this place is not a true `` restaurant style '' space . it 's literally a section off the casino floor that you might think looks good but do n't want to wait in line . wait in line . trust me ! the gumbo is why i come here . you can order it spice level 0-10 and trust me , it packs a punch !! portions are huge and extremely satisfying ! i love this food so much ! to me , there is nothing like this in arizona -lrb- or nothing i know of -rrb- and is definitely worth a try . come here with friends or on a date , it 's a great restaurant . plus , you 're already inside talking stick so enjoy the casino , music or dance clubs upstairs afterwards . boom , there 's your next fun night out already planned !		5		1
our group totaled 5 people , and we arrived in two separate cars . parking was easy on a rainy saturday night , as the place is located in the mini-mall across from arrowhead mall . i surveyed two others here at the house , afterwards - one rated it a 4 star , one rated it 3.2 `` because it 's freakin ' small '' and i gave it a 4.5 , for a total of 3.9 stars . i 'd bet the actual stars went up if i asked the other two , as they thought it was ultra-convenient to be able to walk next door afterwards and have their pick of 31 flavors of ice cream . so , the place is small . not much seating inside , with a few two-tops outside -lrb- which do n't do any good on the few days in phoenix it does rain -rrb- . however , the staff immediately drug a 2-top next to a 4-top to accomodate a party of 5 , as the tables designed for that were taken . extra points there , for sure . food was great , and they brought us samples of beef/chicken to taste as we decided . we tried quite a few things - although somehow nobody went with the spam , nor the fish available - which are both valuable menu items and spam is hard to find - so if you want it , u can get it here , a couple of different ways . you can get combo meals -lrb- 2 or more items -rrb- , mini meals -lrb- 1 item -rrb- , or `` burger '' options on a few thngs . meals come with rice -lrb- somewhat sticky and fluffy -rrb- , pasta salad which is basically pasta , carrots and mayo -lrb- yay ! no `` salad whip '' crap -rrb- but could use a bit of spicing up . oh yeah , they lay the proteins on a bed of steamed -lrb- ? -rrb- cabbage . nice touch , cooked so its crisp yet tender . the beef and pork are very good . the chicken i think we all agreed leaned a bit to the too-sweet teriyaki side . crab rangoons are nicely fried , with a bit of crab and a mild cream cheese . i heard the egg rolls were also tasty , the veggies were minced well so no `` stringy '' problems , with a kick of fresh ginger and a nice thin wrapper . portions on everything we ordered were large . everyone had leftovers . so , do n't let the price discourage you - and you might consider sharing a combo . sweet/sour sauce was sweet with little sour . teriyaki is , well , teriyaki . the soy sauce was korean , and a bit on the light side - but i 'm kinda set in my ways on soy sauce . service , as i eluded to - was awesome . totally family-run from what i could tell . a lot of hawaiian patrons surrounded us - so i 'd suspect its as authentic as you might get on the mainland , in the middle of the desert . they also have a selection of hawaiian-made beverages in cans , which are n't spectacular , but i chose to go that route -lrb- no one else did -rrb- because i like to support businesses that import specific items ! otherwise , they have coca-cola products and i prefer pepsico . #justsayin . if yer in the mall , or wan na try some bbq that is n't bathed in smoke or one of the well-known styles of sauce , give this a shot , for sure . if you are looking for a kick of spice , bring yer own - because i did n't see any way to kick it up a notch . it 's very `` commerical and chain-looking '' from the outside , but i can assure you it does n't taste that way . i forgive their choice of mall location and wish them well ! we 'll go back for sure . i added a scan of one side of the menu for an idea of what they have ! check it in the photo section !		5		1
as far as i know , i 'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them . i could be wrong , but i 'm pretty sure i 'm right . i mean , i 'm always right . by now , if you read my reviews , you know that i am vegan and i do n't eat gluten . this makes dining out quite an issue at times , especially for breakfast/brunch . i really wanted to hit up the vig uptown for brunch because i like it as a happy hour spot , the space is incredible , it is within a bike ride from my house , and i love the original vig , but alas , there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me . i gently mentioned in person and a few times on facebook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu . they listened . they created . they named . -lrb- after me !!! -rrb- we stopped by for brunch this past sunday for the dishes debut , and got a personal hello from tucker . he was excited because they had already sold ten amber scramblers that morning and it is n't even officially on the menu yet ! i 'm already a star ! so , whats the verdict on the amber scrambler ? amazing . seriously . the thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes . they bring such a delicious flavor ! it certainly does n't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico . i 'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $ 5 fresh squeezed mimosas ! if you know whats good for you , you will too .		5		1
do n't worry about the fact that this is in a strip mall , or the chinatown decor , sit down , preferably near the window & get ready for the show . i ordered pan fried pot stickers , which were easily the best i 've ever had . then the fresh mango juice , best i 've had since i lived in brazil & cut the mangoes off the tree . the spicy pan fried noodles with beef -lrb- # 34 -rrb- were flat out incredible . with prices that are pretty close to what they charge at panda express , the food is easily ten times better . the noodles are scratch made , fresh for every order , and you can watch them slapping & pulling the noodles through the window if you have the right seat . go here , even if you order ahead & take it to go . you wo n't regret it !		5		1
my favorite lunch place downtown ! stick to any of the pastrami or corn beef sandwiches . my personal favorite is the new yorker . pastrami -lrb- or corned beef if you prefer -rrb- with cole slaw and russian dressing . . mmm . their other sandwiches are pretty good too -lrb- i 've gotten a turkey sandwich that was good and the deli chix sandwich was ok -rrb- . now , you have to be on your toes when ordering as they move pretty fast , which is understandable considering the big lunch line . fries are the default and you have to speak up if you want something else . mac and cheese is good . salad and fruit are good options if you 're trying to mitigate the damage done to your diet from the sandwich . i also like all the historical photos of downtown phoenix and the owners ' story . mix of all different business types , lawyers , etc. . makes downtown phoenix feel like a real downtown .		5		1
oh feztini , you 're so sweet you made me blush ... or maybe it was the three kinds of alcohol that did it . your savory friends were just as pleasing ... what with the seafood kibis -lrb- like a crab cake , but it did n't make me break out in hives ... i think i found a new love ! -rrb- and the chicken phyllo packets . but what made both of them that much better was the pesto aioli and roasted red pepper aioli that went with them . how is it that when you put ` aioli ' at the end of something , it 's always so good ? then , there 's my new bff , the casablanca chicken sandwich . moist chicken breast , creamy salty goat cheese , and sweet cherries , pears , and raspberry vinaigrette ... does that just make your mouth water ? everyone was very happy with their order , and i did get a chance to try a piece of the lamb kisra . the lamb was so moist and flavorful , if i were n't already bursting full , i might have wanted one . that one 's for my next visit , for sure . the decor is spectacular . i was tempted to try to sneak out with one of those adorable green stools . the glass panels were tre-chic ... i only wish i had the same look in my studio . i also have to make mention that our server was very nice and attentive . she never hesitated to make sure we were all happy . and as if this place could n't get any better , i finally got to meet thomas ! my friends and i had an absolutely wonderful night ... fez definitely did n't disappoint . oh ... and just one warning . if you get the garlic fries ... do n't bother with gum . it wo n't help . but they 're damn good !		5		1
under 475 calories for each dish ... that is amazing ! it just proves that you can have phenomenal , simple , yet healthy food and still feel full . we shared the yellow beet salad -lrb- delicious -rrb- and the ravioli app -lrb- again , delicious -rrb- . then for my entree , i had the trout . it was so smooth and tender , i ca n't believe they did n't use an ounce of butter to cook it . the asparagus and carrots were expertly al-dente -lrb- i think that 's how you spell it -rrb- . my girls scallop dish was just as delicious . seared and tender just perfectly . we absolutely could n't leave without trying a mini-desert dish . the pecan pie was heavenly in every scoop as was a -lrb- shared -rrb- key lime pie . a great restaurant . it 's too bad it 's a little on the pricey side . what would be great is to have a place like this so more people could see what good , healthy food can be . overall ... . best restaurant food i 've had in a long time !		5		1
here it is ... my 100th review ... and i do n't have a speech prepared ... oh well , here goes ! go here -lrb- http://khyberhalal.blogspot.com/ -rrb- to see pictures and descriptions of the food on their menu . it is very accurate . although the mantoo picture does n't really emphasize that it is 12 pieces of deliciousness ... this place is fricking amazing , the service was excellent as well as friendly and it smells simply divine . after several months of saying ` we need to stop at this place one day ' we finally made it there last night for take-out . we ordered the following : 1 -rrb- chicken karahi ... mmmmmm mmmmmmm ! we got an order of basmati rice and the flavors of this bone-in -lrb- but cut into manageable pieces -rrb- was fantastic . never had anything like it , but it was awesome . i woke up this morning wanting more ... but there was none . 2 -rrb- mantoo ... this was possibly the star of an all-star show . we decided that they reminded us of dumplings or of non-fried crab rangoon , only filled with ground beef , seasonings and topped with one -lrb- technically two ? -rrb- of the most delightful sauces ever . 3 -rrb- chicken tikka masala - i chose medium spicy this time ... you know i had to have it . and it was delicious . -lrb- we also had the basmati rice with this one because it 's a saucy dish and that 's how i like it ... if you ask nicely , they may let you substitute the naan that it comes with for rice instead -rrb- 4 -rrb- beef samosas and chicken samosas ... both were fantastic , but i think i loved the beef one just a * little * bit more . the seasoning was superb . we also dipped it into the sauce that came with the mantoo ... omfg ... wow . 5 -rrb- garlic naan ... i 've never met a garlic naan that i did n't like . 6 -rrb- baklawa -lrb- aka baklava -rrb- ... one of the best i 've ever had . nutty and honey-ey ... mmmm ... we 're actually planning on going back again tomorrow night so i can try the okra bamya and the eggplant banjan and see what that bolanee/aloo paratha is all about .		5		1
best martinis in the entire valley ! maybe even the world ! yes they are $ 13 each , but you ca n't drink more than two without stumbling out of this place . my favorite drinks are : - side car -lrb- sweet and tastes harmless , but wow ! -rrb- - english garden -lrb- those who do n't like it sweet -rrb- - absinthe -lrb- for artists -rrb- - chimay -lrb- the big bottle for beer snobs -rrb- the food is just as good . i almost never order anything beside the signature sandwich , the az88 chicken sandwich . the crowd is the most diverse in the valley too . always well dressed , there are gay and lesbians , hot dates , groups of friends and even 60 year old people and an occasion child . usually great art . i wish they would change it little more often , but is thought provoking and fun . i am a regular . i am here at least once month .		5		1
this is one of my very favorite places , for a special night or just any night . disclaimer : there is often a wait , and the parking lot is small , so you might be stuck using the free valet - but it 's totally worth it ! beautifully cozy inside - big booths and tables , soft lighting , open floorplan . gorgeous patio outside , with big trees covered in little white lights . very romantic , but also fun for a group and a great , crowded bar for girls night . the service has been pleasant every single time - no mean feat for so many visits . i love this food ! the tuna tartare , served over guacamole , is amazing - i used to drive 25 minutes each way just to get this to go . i highly recommend the ground ahi burger -lrb- so delicious ! -rrb- , the fish tacos , the fried chicken -lrb- `` amazing !! '' from multiple friends -rrb- , the veggie tacos , the veggie burger ... i 'll stop before i 've listed every item on the menu , but really , you ca n't go wrong . the baked mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes are also to die for . and do n't even get me started on the desserts - keylime pie , red velvet cake , the list goes on . over the last ten years , i 've probably been here with almost everyone i know . it 's a big favorite with visitors from the east coast , and even my picky eaters can find something to love -lrb- grandma requested plan chicken and mashed potatoes and had only nice things to say -rrb- .		5		1
i ca n't help but laugh at reviewers who spent 5 days in italy and think this qualifies them to know more about gelato than someone who spent most of his life there -lrb- arlechhino 's owner -rrb- . and additionally spent over a year learning from a -lrb- italian -rrb- master gelato maker -lrb- in italy -rrb- for no pay . really , ignore those fools . arlecchino still makes the best effing gelato i 've ever had . anywhere . and anyone who tells you it tastes just like any other gelato has a broken brain . or tongue . or both . or is possibly high on crack . or maybe employed by gelato spot . take your pick . p.s. the owners and staff are awesome .		5		1
after being waived in the general direction by the fancy but vapid doorman at amsterdam , and wandering the deserted north block to no avail , i stumbled randomly into the doors of sans , an oasis in the desert of central phoenix late at night . swanky decorations , mind-blowing colors on the way through to the bathroom -lrb- just see you your eyes adjust from violent purple to blood red -rrb- , atmospheric music and sleek decor -lrb- combination of rocks and wood and glass -rrb- , super-friendly staff -lrb- who didnt yell at me after dropping my chopsticks 3 times and stealing all the spare sets off the next table -rrb- , and a very creative and tasty menu with one of the best desserts i have ever had -lrb- green tea cheesecake with mango sauce and some sort of berry -rrb- . open late , the bar food for the higher end -lrb- yeah not cheap but so worth it -rrb- .		5		1
fashion square is fun for so many different reasons . its a huge , well kept mall with tons and tons and tons of shopping ! plus , the people watching here is one of a kind ! i am normally not a mall person , but this place is a must see and a full exception to my anti mall atttitude . this mall is very high end . tiffanys , future home of barneys , and everything else under the sun . i know several people who consider this a destination spot when they come out to visit because of the draw that it has . they even have valet ! woohoo . anyways , great place to bring your parents , out of town guests , dates , friends and anything in between . the mall has several amazing resturants inside and out , and a great place to get drinks as well . this place is bomb diggty ! you cant go wrong with this ! fail free zone !		5		1
abridged : meat . cheese . potatoes . in bread . oh and banoffee pie . unabridged : this is my favorite pasty location . first off , there is tons of space . tons . the decor also has a nice relaxing but slightly sophisticated feel . and there are n't a million asu students prancing about and hardly ever a wait in line when we head there for lunch . vegetarian or not , there 's always a pasty for everyone . every time i 've gone to either location , i 've never gotten the same one twice , and i still have over 3/4 of the menu to clear off my list with most of them being ones i would love to enjoy . they 're big enough that half the time i end up taking half home with me ... though that 's probably because i after trying the banoffee pie , i have n't been able to not order it since . so usually it 's take half my pasty home and split banoffee , which is the most heavenly dessert on the planet . all the items are made there , and if you sit at the bar/kitchen area you can watch them making them right there in the restaurant . it 's kinda fun really . sometimes i watch a little too closely if i know they 're making a favorite , trying to figure out how i can mimic this masterpiece at home . alas , i 've always ended up failing . one thing to note is that while they make them there , they prep them in advance so you can not substitute . however , i 've been toying with the idea of calling a week in advance to have a special one made and paying up front so i can enjoy it a few days later . so , back to this banoffee pie deal ... i think i need to inform you in advance to save you from desperately trying to resist its allure when you visit due to this amazingly good review . so , it 's a pretty awesome dessert . first , you start with a thick graham cracker crust . i am personally not a huge fan of graham cracker , but this is n't your typical crust like on a pie or a lemon bar . this looks like texas toast . for serious . then add some homemade caramel , homemade whipped cream and bananas . this only adds up to a win .		5		1
going to desert botanical garden is the perfect field trip for a beautiful day like today ... i 've been to dbg a handful of times for events , exhibit openings , meetings , and of course yelp in bloom -lrb- a yelper party that i planned a couple of years ago -rrb- ... but today i went with my son and we met some other friends with the sole purpose of checking out the butterfly exhibit . we did n't get lucky enough to have a butterfly land on us , but we did see tons of gorgeous butterflies . there were orange butterflies and yellow butterflies and striped butterflies , etc. . . the flowers in the pavillion are pretty to look at as well . we visited the gift kiosk afterward and took home a butterfly finger puppet , which i know we will get tons of use from -lrb- only $ 6.25 -rrb- . the exhibit runs until may 13th , so do n't miss it ! and if you do find yourself with more time while you 're there , definitely check out the design for a living world exhibit as well ... i saw that when it first opened and it was really cool . the photography alone is worth a visit . i just wish i had more time to explore dbg more often !		5		1
this year 's devoured phoenix was incredible ! i attended this event with two good friends and we had a complete blast . i ran a half marathon on sunday morning and was ready to pig out throughout sunday afternoon . it was great to see so many friends all in one place enjoying amazing food samples from various independent restaurants throughout the valley . loved so many of the wines from many of the wineries here in our state . food wise , i had so many favorites i ca n't even remember the samples or the restaurants . as for the wine , my fave was arizona stronghold 's nachise . after the event , we took the light rail back to our cars , headed home , and slept like a baby . thank you to the the phoenix art museum , the organizers , restaurants , wineries , and the amazing volunteers . i look forward to next year 's event ! cheers ***		5		1
on our search for a quick , easy bite , we yelped this place thinking it was a steak house . wrong ! deliciously exquisite vegan , vegetarian , and meatatarian food awaits . it 's in the old philly cheese steak location , right next to stingray . the server behind the counter , even as busy as he was , greeted us like we were old friends . the menu is well-rounded , with a flair for healthy options . wraps , salads , sandwiches , and juices are their specialty . i opted for the spicy shrimp protein bowl . it was a huge portion , literally packed with shrimp . the black rice was a little gooey and delicious . filled to the brim with cauliflower , broccoli , carrot slivers , and shrimp . i was full about 1/2 way into it , but it was so tasty , i ate the whole thing ... and i did n't feel a bit of guilt . there is outside seating and self serve water . the inside is kinda small but for scottsdale weather , who cares ! this will become a definite regular for us .		5		1
wow ! for those of you that might think the name is misspelled and missing an -lrb- r -rrb- ... your wrong , as i was . pasty is an english dish of whatever filling wrapped in a flaky , buttery crust . yummy ! this was another location listed in phoenix top sandwiches , so i stopped by again for something to go ... this is not something to eat in my car ! add the cleaning bill to the total tab and it got a little pricey . seriously though this place rates so high on my go to list that i visited twice in one week . 1st i had the salmon pasty ... that was amazing , with little potatoes , spinach and a great sauce . second visit i had the greek pasty , fresh salad and a bowl of an amazing mushroom soup ! my friends tried the lamb and i can tell you it was also a hit ! the mesa location is on considerably bigger than the tempe location and i love the old church pews lined up as picnic tables for a large group . i also got to observe a party enjoying a very large pint with their meal and was quite jealous . this should be on your go to list as well . happy eating !		5		1
cibo , you are my favorite pizza place in the valley ! you never disappoint me on your pizzas and salad choices and you have quite the selection of fine italian wine . i was there the other day , again , with a special someone and cibo was the perfect place for the night . the outdoor patio garden was so cute with the trees and other greenery , i forgot we were in the desert for that night . the pizzas are phenomenal and they use the freshest ingredients . i know your thinking well so does pizzeria bianco 's and other places but cibo has the perfect crust ! it 's soft , chewy , burnt to the right crisp . we ordered the caprese salad and the fungi pizza . two great choices you ca n't go wrong . we also ordered the fresca for desert and it was delicious . i could n't stop picking at the kiwi , which was with other fresh fruits they used for this enormous dessert dish . cibo gets all my 5 stars and more !		5		1
i enjoy this place so much ! i have been a frequent customer and am rarely disappointed . i recently met a friend here whom had never been before . tues/wed , turns out to be `` ladies night '' and our food and drink were half off ! i venutred away from my usual burger or chicken sandwich and split the turkey burger with my friend ... what a treat !!! it was yummy , and i will forever order this turkey burger . this was surprising to me who typically does n't not order turkey burgers . previous reviews point out the pricing of the food being rather steep . i agree , however , between their happy hour , daily specials , and coupons -lrb- groupon , local dines -rrb- , you are bound to save a few bucks . lastly , i 'd like to mention the atmosphere as being quaint , clean , and casual . my friend commented several times about how much she `` liked this place '' and could n't wait to bring her husband there to experience indulge burger ! indulge is worth a shot !		5		1
what can i say ... it was a really good happy hour . this is definitely a place to be seen as there was n't an empty table in the place . luckily we got seated right away on the patio ... heat lamps included ! the waiter was able to keep up with the busy demand and made sure we were aware of the 2-for-1 happy hour ! the fez lettuce wraps were a pleasant surprise . not the strong asian tastes that you most have come to love . the fez lettuce wraps have a lighter taste with fruit and a light vinaigrette . how do you say no to a rectangular burger ?! there are a wide variety of burgers and chicken sandwiches on the menu . the duxelles burger was absolutely mouthwatering with sautéed mushrooms and onions ... i skipped on the provolone cheese and it was still juicy . very trendy and great lighting inside .		5		1
i am giving flamingo palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any chinese restaurant i 've tried in phoenix . i like bamboo house and superdragon , too , but this is by far my favorite . my in-laws are chinese food experts . i never thought we could get them to like chinese food in phoenix as they are from new york , where good chinese food lives . but they love flamingo palace . every time they visit us , they ask to go there . i just had my book club there and they were so awesome ! we had heaps of food and each was better than the next . plus , the service was just amazing - this with 13 people in our group . i had such a pleasant , stress-free experience . they gladly substituted chicken for pork , and as other people have noted , their chicken is the good stuff . also , they are very generous with shrimp , meat , etc. . people in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu , which i 've never really noticed before . i 'm not much of a drinker . but everyone really enjoyed the plum wine . it was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other chinese restaurants . for example , try the house flamingo chicken . it is so good . we wiped out their szechuan chicken , it was spicy and fantastic . i also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp . yum !		5		1
my husband and i ventured to mabel 's after day drinking at other happy hours . we were intrigued by mabel 's because their happy hour runs until 9 p.m. . the place is amazing decor and ambiance-wise . we were seated promptly at the bar where we chatted for hours with fellow drinkers and the bar staff . i had a coupon for a free cocktail , which the bartender made especially for me based off my likes/dislikes . i also had a local dines giftcard . so we were able to order a lot of booze for a nice price . we tried an array of cocktails and beers and loved every single one . the goulet was my absolute favorite . the place definitely got busy as the night progressed , so cashing out involved a bit of patience , but we did n't mind . the bartenders had been phenomenal all night , even letting me charge my iphone , so i 'll happily give them patience . definitely one of my new favorite places to drink in scottsdale .		5		1
omg ... i 'll start at the beginning . waiting at the bar at this cute little house -lrb- used to be sophie 's bistro -rrb- for the maceachern 's to arrive . our bartender , rachel , was so helpful , knowledgeable , cute , had us try litte cherry bomb shooters ... shots of vodka with a little cherry drop inside that explodes in your mouth . their signature drinks were amazing as well . thanks , rachel ! then on to our table with our wonderful waitress , jessica . all i can say is , we sat outside on this beautiful evening trying the most outlandish , unique , savory dishes . first they bring you home made biscuits with honey butter . then we shared thrice fried fries -lrb- say that five times fast -rrb- with three dipping sauces and -lrb- are you ready -rrb- garlic toast dipped in bone marrow -lrb- t was buttery , savory , mmmm -rrb- . i had the parsnip soup ... so rich and creamy . my entree was amy 's bolognese ... a garlic bread pudding with a bolognese sauce made w/beef & veal & tomatoes . my hjusband had sand dabs and roasted brussel sprouts . my son had a flat iron steak that melted in your mouth . the presentation by the entire staff as they placed the dinners on our table was awesome . but the best part was the peanut butter creme brulee with pretzels & banana ice cream . binks is an adventure in the middle of phoenix . i ca n't wait to go back .		5		1
i was a bit nervous going into the shop for the 1st time . i had seen reviews on other sites that said the staff was not friendly , and i was needing to ask a lot of questions . i found the staff very helpful . they know their merchandise and can direct you right to the hard to find items . you can find anything you want for cake decorating . the first time i went into the store i was looking for supplies needed to make a princess cake . i saw a cake at a local grocery store and went in looking for the supplies needed to make it myself . they had exactly what i needed all prepackaged in a kit . recently , i sent a friend of mine in because she was throwing herself a double quncineta -lrb- she was turning 30 . -rrb- i made her a beautiful cake but told her she needed to find her decorations . she found everything she needed for her gag b-day cake . the staff at abc told her they want pictures . prices are reasonable . i have found that most stuff is cheaper than buying online , but be prepared ... as other reviews have said , if you are there browsing you will find extra stuff and spend more $ .		5		1
this restaurant is 5 stars for the view alone -lrb- which is what everyone else has mentioned -rrb- , but the food and service are excellent too . the other night my girlfriend and i went back for the first time since the amazing yelp event earlier in the year . we started the night off with a drink at sunset on the outdoor patio , overlooking most of phoenix . then we headed inside for our dinner and the manager greeted us with a `` thank you for coming back to different pointe of view , '' which i thought was a nice touch . i assume he knew we were returning since i mentioned we had a card for a free bottle of sparkling wine when i made the reservations weeks before . we were seated inside near the window and our waiter was very friendly and attentive . our bottle of champagne was presented to us to start the night and we placed our food orders . we decided to split the braised duck ravioli -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- and the pan seared diver scallops -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- . there were two raviolis and two scallops per order and we felt both dishes great choices . the scallops were some of the best i have ever had . for our main course we each ordered the grilled cedar river filet mignon -lrb- $ 38 -rrb- . the perfectly prepared tenderloin steak was accompanied with horseradish crust , swiss chard , roasted fingerling potatoes , smoked apple wood bacon , chives , crème fraiche and port wine pomegranate reduction . no i did n't memorize all of that , of course i retyped it from the menu . for dessert we split the classic tahitian vanilla bean crème brulee -lrb- all desserts $ 9 -rrb- . it was delicious , but rather small and did n't quite satisfy my sweet tooth . the buttercream blue cheese cookie and fresh strawberries were a nice addition , but even with those it was too small a dish . overall , i 100 % recommend you stop in and have dinner and drinks at different pointe of view . it has been one of my favorite phoenix restaurants for many years . it 's a perfect place for locals and out of town visitors alike . my only recommendations for improvements would be to add a server or two to the outside patio bar area since it tends to be slow on busy evenings . also , i think the names for some of their dishes are a bit much and could be shortened .		5		1
my husband and i went to bourbon steak for restaurant and had a very lovely time . for starters , the service was spectacular . the waiters came by regularly refilling water glasses and drink orders . the bartender was extremely friendly and knowledgeable , he made excellent recommendations and mixed a mean manhattan . the restaurant was a bit loud and dark , but we were in good company and unaffected by our surroundings . the meal started with complimentary duck fat french fries served three ways . these were delicious and a great start to a wonderful meal . there was also some sponge bread which was alright , but not spectacular . i ordered the lobster and corn bisque , kobe flat iron steak and 18 year butterscotch pot de creme with beignets . the soup was tasty , the sweetness of the corn and lobster paired well with the spicy apples . there was also a corn bread fritter which added nice texture to the soup . i thought the kobe flat iron was delicious and prepared very well . it was paired with bone marrow mashed potatoes and onions prepared three ways . the dish was delicious and well rounded . the desert was fabulous . the butterscotch pot de creme had just the right amount of bitterseet umph . the beignets added a nice sweet balance to the creme . all in all we had a fantastic experience . i do n't know that i would come here and pay full price , but i was extremely satisfied with my $ 39 meal .		5		1
from the outside crazy otto 's looks like the kind of place i would pass by without a second glance . -lrb- although the name is pretty catchy so i suppose i might look twice . -rrb- inside the decor is simple , license plates adorn the walls and the tables are just tables . but where this place really stands out is in the food . i had read the other reviews and expected to see gigantic pancakes . crazy otto 's did not disappoint ! these things were huge ! the spilled off the platter . platter mind you , not plate . the boyfriend ordered the stack of three . one would have been enough , even with me stealing a few bites . i ordered the eggs , bacon and hashbrowns . the bacon was fine , nothing amazing , but the scrambled eggs were cooked just right and the hashbrowns were the best hashbrowns i have had in phoenix . only al 's breakfast in minneapolis has better ` browns . they were cut thicker than most and had a rich buttery potato flavor . i would go back to crazy otto 's just for that alone . overall , i would say if you care more about what 's on your plate than what 's around you , you 'll love breakfast at crazy otto 's .		5		1
oh z , how do i love thee . let me count the ways . 1 . love your margaritas . seriously . i 'm not a fan of tequila and/or margaritas generally speaking , but i love z 's margaritas . especially the chambord and prickly pear . be warned though - they 're very dangerous . 2 . salsa ! i love it ! they also have an appetizer with a variety of 3 salsas , but honestly , their original is the best . the chips are good too - light and crispy . 3 . everything on the menu . not kidding . i have n't had anything i did n't like at z. my faves include : catfish tacos , jerk chicken salad , diablo pasta , wild mushroom enchiladas , mac & cheese w/o bacon , the trout , seriously , the list could go on and on . my mouth is watering . i think you get the point . go to z. asap .		5		1
move on over , pei wei , pf changs and totties asian fusion ! ling and louie 's is on my radar !! i think , in my humble opinion , that asian food is rather difficult to find here with any quality . pf chang 's is okay . sometimes , pei wei is pretty good , sometimes , not . tottie 's asian fusion location at scottsdale and lincoln road 's is pretty good , but the original has slipped . ahhhh , just when i was going to give up , i see ling and louie 's ! what a delight this was from the get-go ! friendly personnel , a wonderful menu with thai , chinese and japanese flair and selections . and quality , delicious food . really delicious ... the black orchid ahi sashimi was fresh and fabulous . the entree we decided on was their surf and turf , which is filet of beef , sliced with lots of fresh shrimp , mushrooms and onions on a sizzling platter . we ordered a side of fried rice , which was n't anything to wrote home about , but satisfactory . the surf and turf was to-die-for fabulous ! definitely try this yummy restaurant ! you 'll never go back to the other asian places ...		5		1
we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try . the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters -lrb- although it is very much a meat heavy menu -rrb- . for an easter sunday lunch , it was very empty , not a good sign . but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test . our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing . the decor is `` country '' but not like cracker barrel ... more like neo farm dining . i had the blackened fish sandwich , which was cooked really well , nice and seared but juicy , topped with onion , pickles , tomatoes and butter lettuce . i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat ... nothing to burn your mouth . my wife had the tuna sandwich , which was also tasty and seared just right . she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable , but it was her dish , not mine . her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful . i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here . well worth the bike ride .		5		1
sometimes it 's just the simpler things in life which stand out , and when i can enjoy a delicious lunch for under $ 5 , i 'm a happy girl : -rrb- i love this hamburger , and i generally do n't eat red meat 99 % of the time . for i & o burger , i am forced to make an exception with zero regret . i recently read that some of the countries top chefs were polled as to their favorite fast food pick . i & o burger won hands down . a single burger without cheese , grilled onions , substitute mustard for special sauce ... pure heaven ! and , this location has a nicely landscaped drive-thru ... not sure why i noticed , but it was a pleasant wait for a perfectly prepared burger and fabulous fries .		5		1
is ice cream for lunch a bad thing ? i do n't think so either , especially when it comes from sweet republic . what a cool place - how have i survived all this time without coming here ? everything is made in-house from natural ingredients - no crazy things with multiple syllables you ca n't pronounce . so , i can tell myself it is actually * healthy * kind of like salad but much better tasting . : -rrb- the sweet woman behind the counter gave me a couple of samples , and seeing that i really liked them , kept suggesting others to try - `` if you like that , you will love this ! '' i wanted to leap over the counter and hug her , but somehow managed to restrain myself . i settled on a scoop of vanilla bean and one of sugar n spice , and started a list in my head of the flavors i want to try next -lrb- belgian chocolate ! real mint chip !! -rrb- . walking out with my cup clutched in my greedy hands , i was happier than a little kid at recess .		5		1
the buzz on the street is their pizza will blow your stinky socks off your feet ! well , not exactly in those words , but in that promising context ! if you know me like the back of your hand , you would already know what i look for ! the crust ! for one , i am a carboholic ! whether that be bread , donuts , or rice , i cherish that food group immensely . i firmly believe the most critical bite in a pizza is going to be your first one ! it will make or break your love for it ! why ? because its the closest you will get to freshness since the time it popped out of the oven ! bam ! love at first bite ! just the sight and smell caused some drool-age ! it had the right amount of crispness and thinness . the bottom crust had a slight charcoal , the way one should always like it ! and the middle layer still soft enough for some bending and flexibility ! crust test : pass . during my most recent visit , the amigos and i decided on the `` gladiator . '' yup ! i guess it was indeed the most manly pizza you could get here . glorious meat ! the schreiner 's sausage and pepperoni were cooked very nicely ! the cheese and sauce were no match for the meat ! they played more of a subtle role but still contributed to a wonderful pizza experience . sauce and toppings test : pass . with all that said , i want to clearly say , this is not what i call a true italian pizza . as great as it was its hard for me to put it on the same level as some well-known places like pizzeria bianco , which will always be my numero uno . the major difference is in the sourdough crust . to me , this is what defined their pizza . the one trait that separates them from the italian style is how it is not bubbly with that brick-oven charcoal quality . instead , its more simple yet quite tasty . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ck9uev09ipmstqoqmy3kq?select=q0kucpjhdzlueuitx154vq besides everything said thus far , i want to give credit to their excellent service . the host did a good job in booking our table and notifying my group when our time was near . our server maintained a playful , enthusiastic attitude from the moment we sat to the time we finished our last dessert bite ! speaking of dessert , i happily decided that their red velvet cake be my new go-to ! the frosting and cake was not too sweet , just to my liking ! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7ck9uev09ipmstqoqmy3kq?select=bcrxfhgibosc-erugd3m_g the moral of the story , do not come here if you are seeking a true italian experience . do come here , if you desire a wonderfully tasting pizza in a friendly , cool , upbeat atmosphere !		5		1
i absolutely love this place . when you pull up and valet , does not feel like you are in az anymore . it feels like you are somewhere exotic -lrb- mediterranean -rrb- . the rich earthy colors are just so warm and welcoming . love it ! i ordered the pan roasted halibut for dinner . it is served with a fine herb potato gallette , sautéed mushrooms & vegetables with red wine butter sauce . too yummy for words to explains . you need to try it out for yourself . just too terrific !! i picked the chocolate fantasy -lrb- french chocolate silk on a decadent chocolate cake with chocolate sauce served with vanilla gelato -rrb- for my after dinner pleasure . again , too yummy for words . this is the perfect place for the perfect date , anniversary dinners , and any romantic event . just one of the best dinner experiences that i have had .		5		1
... as always , 5 stars if the place would stand up anywhere . it would . firstly , i 'm overjoyed it survived these past few years . secondly , on a regular saturday night 8:30 - ish , it was 40 % full - and in-line with it 's 2 street-facing co-tenants . that 's hopefully enough to ensure survival . these 3 delightful restaurant/bars have carved out a wonderful second life for the industrial building they 're housed in and provide a luxury of urbanity to this burg . we had to scoot in for a quick small supper before going to a comedy show a friend was in . small check quickly and un-resentfully served - thank you gracious server ! there was a single man drinking a coke and eating a bowl of pasta at the bar while diligently reading his book . it was clear he felt abundantly welcomed . that tableau epitomizes the civilized urbane establishment this place is . the pasta carbonara remains true after two years to the unremittingly high standard set for me by a queens neighborhood italian joint decades ago - and pasta bar remains the only other place i 've ever ordered it more than once . for that , and so much more , i 'm eternally grateful .		5		1
we drive by the armadillo grill all the time and have always thought it was just another bar . we finally decided to give it a try tonight and we were pleasantly surprised . all of the employees were extremely friendly and the service was really fast . if our glasses were less then half full our waitress would automatically bring a new soda . the happy hour is a great deal.they have half price munchies and $ 3 well drinks . we started out with the potato skins which were good because they were made with real potatoes not like the fake looking potatoes you get at chain restaurants . for dinner i had the bar b que pulled pork sandwich and my fiance had the buffalo chicken sandwich . both were really delicious !! the atmosphere is fun because you can tell this is the kind of place that has `` regulars '' and where the locals hang out . not to mention there is a tv practically every 3 feet with some sort of sport on it . we occasionally go to turf paradise but with armadillo grill so close maybe will start coming here to do a little off track betting . much better food than the horse track and a lot less sweaty guys in tank tops .		5		1
summer time and the livings easy and so are the resort rates on the pocket book . the biltmore makes my list for top places to staycation or vacation , depending on your origin . i 've frequented the biltmore many many times over the years and i have yet to have a bad experience yet . the resort is historical , elegant and fun all at the same time . brunch : the biltmore is an excellent brunch destination . if you are looking for a place to take your mom for mother 's day or brunch for a sunday afternoon , their food is good and plentiful . from homemade omlet to heaping shrimp stations , i 've never once left hungry . in fact , my scale my claim i 've left a pound heavier . i 've spent so many holidays here for brunch , i can give them the two thumbs up . i suggest though that you ask for a reservation in the main dining room if you do brunch on a holiday . i personally like it better because it 's less like a banquet . lunch/dinner : i love their cafe and now that it 's been remodeled , i love it even more ! it 's got a great atmosphere to enjoy the nice weather -lrb- when the weather is nice -rrb- . i 'm a sucker for anything chocolate -lrb- if you have n't figured that out yet -rrb- and they have s'mores . how can i have some more when i have n't had any yet ? oh yeah , i did a sandlot reference . but seriously , i love their s'mores . our table gets our own make your own s'mores set up equipped with fire , sticks , marshmallows , graham crackers and chocolate . it 's the best way to end the meal . on a nice day or night , sit outside and enjoy the chirping birds and trees . i love the crackling outdoor fire place . hotel : oh they 've got it mastered . the beds are comfy , the rooms are big and the amenities . i heart the amenities . pools as far as the eye can see . literally , i have yet to count the exact number of pools the hotel really has . quiet pools , loud pools , big kid pools , little kid pools , a huge slide , jacuzzis galore just keeps going and i love it . in the summer , i 've enjoyed movies by the pool . this summer they are having a hollywood and wine series with a variety of live music , wine nights , movie nights , theater , etc. . the grounds have croquet , tons of grass to run around on or walk , tennis courts , a personal guide to take you on hikes , high tea in the afternoon and more . writing this makes me want a staycation right this minute . see you there ! ps summertime rates are a-ok in the low to mid 100 's a night . not bad for a five star resort !!		5		1
the holy grail has been found . high end asian buffet , sushi that is all you can eat , and made to order !!! yes , that 's right ! fresh made ! you go up to the dude at the sushi bar , and pick whatever you want off of the menu , and he makes it ! yes ! wow ! also , the food end of the buffet is top notch ! mounds of tempura . so thankful for finding the great reviews here on yelp ! prices are n't too bad either - 15.99 on friday or saturday night , a bit cheaper during the week , and under $ 10 for lunch . also if you mention yelp , you get $ 5.00 off the bill for 3 or more !!! service was impeccable ! very clean , nicely laid out , etc. . i can not wait to return .		5		1
this place is great . it is next to windsor . i give it 5 stars for everything . well done . once again . owners : craig demarco , owner of postino winecafe . ` opening day for windsor and churn is scheduled for monday , april 25 , 2011 . ` federal pizza opening monday , october 22 , 2012 . met one of the chefs , ` monster . ' he was intense and forthcoming . a fellow human with zest and energy should be mentioned in everyday conversation . he recommended the casanova -lrb- prosciutto + dates + ricotta + arugula + pecorino 14 -rrb- also the sweet potato -lrb- sweet potato + sage + ricotta 13 -rrb- if you are vegan he recommends : ` brussels sprout -lrb- roasted brussels sprouts + pancetta + manchego + roasted garlic + lemon zest 13 -rrb- ` at last -lrb- broccolini + roasted corn + goat cheese + fresno chilis + basil + lemon zest 13 -rrb- also , if you have not already succumb to the paleo diet , and you can imbibe the sweet pinch and light taste of carbs , then eat this . ` garganelli -lrb- broccolini + lemon basil pesto + pine nuts + oven roasted tomatoes + red pepper + pecorino 11 -rrb- ` orecchietti -lrb- schreiner 's sausage + swiss chard + shallot herb broth 11 -rrb- enjoy . rl note . when a customer asks a bartender what the alcohol content is over the special beer , the correct responst is not , `` uhh i do n't know , google it . '' cough .		5		1
i 'm disappointed in myself for not getting dessert or iced coffee , but i needed room for food . i think that should be an entire separate trip because the food was too good to stop myself . i even got to spot a little local celeb while there . mr. bianco himself . i tried to be sly and peek at what he was eating so that i could order it . you know it 's good if he 's eating it , right ?! all i could tell was that it was a pressed sandwich for anyone curious . and i think he caught on to me being ridiculous because he started smiling . or he wants to date me , in which case haaaayyyyyyyyyyyy ; -rrb- during my wonderful trip to liberty i got to taste the hummus , sweet potato salad , pizza , the picnic sandwich , and the caprese sandwich . first things first , i am going to spend now until november trying to make that sweet potato salad . it was insanity . it was roasted and i could taste the garlic and there were craisins and oh my gosh . i need to figure out how to make it so that i can take credit for it at thanksgiving dinner . with respect to liberty of course : -rrb- second - how the heck can i pick a favorite between balsamic drizzled bread with ripe , red tomatoes , tons of fresh basil , divine mozarella or the turkey with bleu cheese crumbles , granny apple slices , and candied pecans ? both sandwiches were so amazing . my eating companion and i decided that the caprese sandwich was the winner . so amazing . but that does n't discount how awesome the picnic is , because that is amazing in it 's own right . i 've already figured out my next trip . instead of ordering two entrees and switching halves with the other diner , we will order and split only one entree , one side and then we will have room for dessert . or i 'll just go in and order a ton of desserts . whatever .		5		1
some might say that phoenix is a city without much culture . that may be true in some aspect , however we have to remember that phoenix is a young large city compared to other cities that lie within the united states . so you can say that this city is a work in progress on catching up with everyone 's culture expectations . the japanese friendship garden in downtown phoenix is only seven years old . very new to the park scene for this metro , i have to say that it looks great and will only keep getting better in time . that will happen if people stop saying there is no culture in phoenix and become a part of the evolving city by visiting places such as this . the admission and or donations will fund a more desired park for all . the grounds of the garden are very beautiful with a nice flowing stream , several waterfalls , coy fish , and many species of plants . i ca n't wait to go back in the next several years to see it become a wonderful masterpiece .		5		1
i 've never had a bad meal at pane after four years ... maybe five . from the moment i set foot inside , it took me back to a hip , la kinda vibe . small , not a lot of menu choices , fresh , organic food selections ... and bubble up ... the malibu of pop , people . the food is simply done and quite delish . i usually alternate between the sopressata and the mozzarello/tomato/basil sandwiches , or go with the caprese salad . they make the bread onsite , the basil is grown locally as is most of the veggies . the crowds get pretty big after 11:30 a.m. and do n't die down until around 1:45 p.m. . they close at 3 p.m because chris would head down to pizzeria bianco for a busy evening . apparently he is taking a back seat due to some health concerns . i hope it does n't affect the food quality but i 'm sure his staff will continue his tradition of fresh , tasty and simple . ** word of advice : do not crave this place in august . they shut down for a month-long vacation !! oh , dread !		5		1
this is an excellent store and a great addition to the phoenix area . it is rather big , roughly the size a larger grocery store . the parking lot is a bit on the scary side and the store is often crowded , but the latter should be a good indication of what to expect inside . lee lee has a nice produce section , full of staple fruits , vegetables , tubers and so forth like carrots , apples and potatoes , but it also has a wide array of specialty foods like indian eggplant , bok choy , lemon grass and dare you try it , durian . as a vegetarian i ca n't fairly describe the seafood and butcher section , but i can it 's large and inclusive , from catfish to pig uterus . beyond that there are aisles dedicated to korea , japan , thailand , the philippines , thailand , indonesia , brazil/caribbean , india , the middle east , ramen noodles , dried noodles , imported liquor , hefty bags of rice and more . lee lee can be a fun place , but it 's largely practical . i find that i can get about two weeks ' worth of groceries on one trip . however , i always have to go to my local grocer to get some odds and ends lee lee does n't carry , like bagels , cheese and a few other minor things . other than that i come out with a large amount of groceries for a reasonable price . do n't let the cultural barrier dissuade you . it 's a great place to get nori maki arare , japanese candies , thai chilies , chicory coffee , tahini , instant indian meals , crates of ramen , frozen samosas , chutneys , wasabi , incense , and much , much more , right down to bizarre eats : sake in juice boxes , cheese and corn ice cream , grass jelly , silkworm pupae , canned crickets and unnameable horrors from all corners of the globe . with that in mind , remember the hsbc marketing campaign of cultural perspectives : delicious in one , disgusting in the other , etc. . give it a shot , try something new while also finding old favorites .		5		1
very cozy little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in downtown chandler . the closest cross streets for yoli 's are s wall st. and chicago , and visitors coming here for the first time may have a hard time finding it if they do n't routinely shop in the little artisan craft plaza the restaurant is in . once you enter , you are greeted warmly by one of the family members . we had brunch here , and left pleasantly full and satisfied . the meals are a very good price for the portions given . i was especially impressed with the carne asada burrito -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . the burrito was gigantic , encompassing the whole plate , with a side of delicious freshly made salsa and some sour cream . the tortilla was grilled which gave a nice added texture to the meal . they have a `` choose your own breakfast '' option which i tried -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- , which comes with 2 eggs , and then 3 different breakfast selections -lrb- such as french toast , pancakes , breakfast meats , different breakfast potatoes -rrb- . everything was prepared fresh , tasted very good , and a nice option i found was that they had sugar-free syrup for those that did n't want regular syrup . they also have pretty good coffee -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , both hot and iced . it is smooth and rich , no hint of bitterness . if it were n't for yelp i probably would not have even known about yoli 's , but thanks to the wonder that is the internet i now have a good breakfast spot to go to when i want to start my day off right .		5		1
i came here on a friday night , reservations were at 8 but were n't really necessary . the places was crowded and lively , but not packed and obnoxious . we were seated right away and given water without having to ask and served bread , butter and a chile infused olive oil that was delicious . our server was top-notch ! she was friendly , personable and knew the menu like the back of her hand . her wine suggestions were spot on and complimented the meal perfectly . i had the eggplant parmesan -lrb- which was more cheese than eggplant , but i am by no means complaining -rrb- . the noodles were thick spaghetti noodles perfectly cooked -lrb- not quite al dente , but far from mushy -rrb- . the sauce was flavorful and obviously homemade , just had no pizzazz . would n't have minded a mild kick to it . for dessert i had the italian cheesecake . it had a hint of orange in it . while it was good , its definitely not the new york style cheesecake i have grown to love . italian cheesecake is lighter and fluffier as it 's made with ricotta instead of cream cheese . it 's not as sweet or as rich as i like , so it did n't seem quite dessert-y enough for me , by no fault of the chef at aiello 's . the evening was ended with an employee coming to our table with what appeared to be a vase . it was filled to ask us to choose a number from 1-99 . if i chose the same number she picked , our entire meal , minus alcohol , would be comped . i have a liking for the numbers 3 and 7 , for which i can not explain . i picked number 37 , she picked 73 . no free meal for us , but it was a fun touch to the end of a great evening !		5		1
truly , no one else comes close ... i mean this is the bad ass pizza in the true sense of the word . the ingredients are supreme and you can taste every bite of them , , , nothing is burnt . . this is a pizza i could eat for breakfast , lunch and dinner and in the middle of the night . the service is impeccable , warm , attentive ... better than any italian restaurant or pizzeria i have been to in the valley . the owner stefano is very personable and extremely knowledgeable and passionate about his his craft ... the prosciutto is imported , in fact everything is imported ... alright minus the lettuce , tomato , basil , which is local ... come on ! as we have great ingredients in arizona as well . i can not fault anything about this restaurant ... even the location is perfect . it 's hard to believe you are in arizona ... not only a beautiful night to be enjoying a dinner on the patio , but the pizza truly makes you feel like you just flew to italy for dinner . congratulations for bringing a true taste of italy and more specifically . to arizona ... and the tiramisu ... which i usually feel is a tourist trap more than anything truly tasted like the real deal ... smooth , silky , fabulous , jaw dropping ... glad i had it . oh and i know we have pizzeria bianco and all , but this is hands down my favourite ... no joke .		5		1
we went to our first show at the orpheum theatre last night . i thought the theater was absolutely beautiful . i loved the intricate architecture . it felt old but stately . it 's got tons of character and i found myself taking pictures everywhere . the sound was wonderful as well . we saw jake shimabukuro , ukulele virtuoso , there . it was a perfect venue for him . so beautiful , stately , quiet with great acoustics . it really highlighted his performance . i found out it was built from 1927-1929 in spanish midieval and baroque styles . after a while , it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years . they painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era . in the late 80s they started a renovation on it which was completed in 1997 . they brought back much of the original design -lrb- moldings , murals , etc. -rrb- now it 's just wonderful . anytime i see something interesting playing there , the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw . ca n't wait to head back !		5		1
i 've come here a few times , mostly for lunch and i love it every time . they serve the softest , warmest buttered croissants at the beginning - and do n't be shy to ask for more ! they are very nice about it . and they are free ! they have a daily lunch special board - it used to be $ 10 but when we went yesterday , the price has gone up to $ 13 . the entree 's look small , but they actually filled me up . i had the beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes . it was good but got heavy towards the end , so i traded with my brother , he ordered the pesto pasta -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- with and added chicken -lrb- + $ 2 -rrb- . the pesto pasta was very light but almost a little too bland . at the end , you also get a complimentary dessert . our dessert yesterday was a flourless chocolate brownie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top . it was so good ! that definitely made me super full . i would come back again for lunch . the place is small and quaint and the price may seem pricey for lunch , but the quality surpasses the price .		5		1
this place is just so cool . the space is amazing - an indoor/outdoor , sprawling quarter block that includes various rooms in a converted bungalow , plus lots of outdoor decks , nooks , and crannies . the crowd is varied and chill - not a frat boy in sight for miles . heat lamps , twinkly lights , booths , tables , and benches ; something for everyone . they 're often crazy busy and should have more waitstaff to keep things moving at times . plus the menu is totally standard and unremarkable barfare served reasonably cheap . if you 're interested in fast as lightning service at all times and an adventurous menu full of organic locally grown ingredients , run ! but if you want to hang out with your friends under the stars and over a beer for hours on end in the coolest space ever , this is heaven .		5		1
scandinavian cuisine is probably the hardest thing to find in arizona so when ikea was built a few years ago , i was an immediate fan . if you 've lived in finland or sweden , this is a bit of nostalgia that you have to have at least every once in awhile . pass over the typical cafeteria fair offered for americans and go for the meatballs and mashed potatoes , a classic scandinavian meal . you eat it all together - scoop up a meatball covered in gravy and top it off with a bit of the potatoes and lingonberry sauce . delicious ! the lingonberry drink is great to mix with either carbonated water or a bit of sprite to make it more of a soft drink than juice or grab a bottled cider and do n't forget to grab a `` princess cake '' for dessert . you 'll feel like you 're far north rather than in the middle of the desert .		5		1
ummm ... drive-thru boba ? how can this be a bad thing ? well , it just so happens that it ca n't ! thai iced tea , taro , and honeydew too ! this place is the best ! the lady who runs the counter is very nice and the donuts are delicious ! stopped in for a honeydew melon boba and a ham and cheese croissant and my kids spent the next hour munching quietly on donut holes , which was just a reward in itself ! the prices are cheap , the service is friendly , and i will take bosa over krispy kreme and dunkin donuts any day of the week ! also an fyi , ignore the bosa website - this location does not serve kolache 's and they have their own hours which i believe are 5am-10pm every day !		5		1
this is still one of our favorite restaurants . thus far i have taken my parents , friends from out of town , book club , my husband/son and just last night i took my brother and his friend from out of town who was able to just pop up to our neck of the woods by taking light rail ! i am always impressed with the professional way this bar is run and the fabulous food and the open air environment . i love the poke , the fish cakes , the french fries , and i nearly always get the spicy shrimp caesar . i highly recommend this restaurant still and i am delighted to say they are still open and doing a brisk business every time we go in .		5		1
since today i hiked camelback -lrb- the echo canyon side -rrb- for the first time of the `` season '' , i thought i 'd review it . and how out of shape do i feel now ! i used to hike camelback 2-3 times a week until i hurt my knee last year , and i would make pretty good time . not today , i am embarrassed to say it almost took me twice as long ... i am going to blame it on the still 100 degree heat and unrelentless sun ! i love this hike because of the great location right in the middle of p.v. and usually it is a pretty short and intense hike , so i can get my workout for the day done quick . since i have a short attention span , long hikes are n't good for me ! i also love camelback for the rock climbing it offers , so close to home ! bonus ! i actually saw a few newbies top roping today ! but climbers , beware ! the rock is pure choss ! i have had holds come off in my hands and i 've slide down the rock on my belly ! painful ! thank goodness i was just bouldering ! another thing ... watch out for the tourists ! they can be a hazard ! especially coming down the mountain . get out and enjoy the views !		5		1
legit chill irish pub so this review is based on irish pub criteria . it 's dark and moody , it 's got good food ... great drinks , and good people . food - b + bordering on a. get the mussels . done . drinks - b + / a - i like the availability of irish/english brews on tap and they have cider . i am a freak for cider , but that 's just me . oh and their house wines are legit . seating - a + + dark corners , tables , booths , high tops . the patio - decent sized for what you got ta do out there . hey , and there 's a game room ! sweet . when i used to live in chandler this was an often visited watering hole . i kinda miss its chill vibe oh and i forgot to mention : there 's a filibee 's in the parking lot . so , if you need some grub at 2:15 am ... you 're covered . i just decided after writing this review , i 'm heading back asap . you dark mistress fibber 's ... ya got me .		5		1
there are sandwiches and then there are samichez . i would walk a mile for miracle mile ! i 'm not sure about the entire menu mind you so my review is based off of certain items . for instance the straw ! juicy pastrami piled high with melted swiss cheese and hot sauerkraut on rye bread delish . ok i must admit i was a pastrami virgin before the mile . so i have nothing to base the deliciousness of this pastrami against . all i can tell you is it tastes great to me . now i am not a virgin when it comes to there macaroni salad and that salad came to party ! it 's really good ! the deserts are great to i love the pecan pie ! i can not even call it pecan pie it is peeecan pie , not to sweet just right scoop of vanilla ice cream sets this off ! the cheesecake is yummy and the carrot cake well it is some of the best i have tasted in awhile . also this little known tid bit , they serve farmer brothers coffee ! which i find to be the best of the pre-ground coffee 's out there . i prefer farmer brothers over starbucks any day . check out the mile and try the pastrami . ps i got ta knish once , yea once . i do n't recommend it bluck !		5		1
there are so few restaurants that deserve a 5-star rating , but razz is undoubtedly one of them . while the exterior of the building appears nondescript , the interior is tastefully decorated and replete with artwork hanging on the walls . we always make a reservation to sit at the chef 's table and everything we 've ever had has been phenomenal . my husband and i have very diverse tastes and are willing to try just about anything , but i can honestly say that beef tongue is probably not something that we would ever have ventured to taste had it not been served to us here . it 's now one of our favorite dishes , as is the `` macaroni and cheese '' with lobster and crab meat . the wine selection is great as well and we typically ask razz to recommend a bottle and have never been disappointed . it 's so clear that razz is an incredibly talented chef who is doing what he loves to do ! the restaurant does close over the summer so we will be eagerly awaiting its reopening in the fall to try some more of razz 's amazing creations .		5		1
new to phoenix and my first time to st. francis . and was it great ! it 's got the bistro vibe . white tablecloths covered in paper -lrb- that 's ok -rrb- and the place was busy , busy , busy . we sat upstairs but next time i want to be where the action is -lrb- downstairs even though it was loud down there -rrb- . our waiter was fab ; did i mention he looked like louie c.k. ? the wine was a big pour , and the food , oh the food ! we all had the french onion burgers and they were so darn good . but the best part was the side of polenta . it was the best polenta i have ever had -lrb- creamy and out of this world -rrb- . everyone was too full for dessert . we had reservations and even got a call that afternoon from the restaurant confirming -lrb- that was a nice touch -rrb- . what would i ask the st. francis to improve ? their menu is in really small print and hard to read if you `` forgot your reading glasses '' . thanks for a nice evening st. francis . see you next time .		5		1
grant that i am even less expert in viet cuisine than many others , but i know what i like and what 's good to me . based on the limited universe of vietnamese restaurants i 've tried , pho avina is the best , and has been so consistently . despite an enviably consistent business , the dining area is always clean but for any tables just vacated . the food has been consistently excellent , the portions adequate or better , the presentation/appearance appealing , the service always decent or better and the prices remarkable in a totally positive way . an added bonus is the extensive boba drink menu , and the addition of a remarkable variety of taiwanese shaved ice dessert combinations , always artfully presented . these are n't the snow-cones most of us grew up with , and at about $ 4 and up , they should be something special , and though they may be old news to taiwanese and west coast asian folk , it 's a new-to-me delight in beautiful , ultra-light , cold dessert that i highly recommend . if it 's a little less appealing as az veers in and out of what passes for cold weather , have a hot pho first , and enjoy . i do n't think you can go wrong with either .		5		1
it 's been a while since i 've eaten at veneto , but now that i live in phoenix , i 'm going to have to make this a go to for great italian food ! the meal i had here was among the most memorable in my life ! we went here on the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel in mesa . when we arrived , we were a bit skeptical . the restaurant is a bit unassuming , and considering it 's tucked away in a strip mall -lrb- granted a very nice strip mall in scottsdale -rrb- , we had second thoughts . as soon as we went inside , however , our concerns were soon allayed . the dining room is absolutely lovely . it is warm and inviting and very nicely done . it makes for a reasonably romantic dining experience if you are looking for that , but it 's also great for groups -lrb- and they have a great patio -rrb- . the decor is not obtrusive , and the atmosphere is very conducive to conversation . the ambiance , plus great service , really makes veneto a destination worth seeking from anywhere in the valley . of course , all the ambiance and service in the world means nothing without good food . fortunately , veneto does n't disappoint in the culinary department . we started our meal with the bruschetta al salmone -lrb- bruschetta with salmon -rrb- . bruschetta is one of my favorite appetizers -lrb- or snacks - basically a favorite all around -rrb- , so it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to this dish . their take on this plate did not disappoint . the flavors were bright and fresh , and the fish played nicely with the fresh tomatoes . absolutely wonderful bruschetta . i was half tempted to order a second plate and just call it a meal . fortunately for me we avoided the temptation to eat nothing bruschetta and moved on to entrees . i had swordfish -lrb- it was a special - not on their usual menu -rrb- and my girlfriend had the ravioli . after being primed for a good meal by a mind blowing appetizer , we were hoping the entrees would live up to the opening act . they did not disappoint . i was a bit hesitant to get seafood at a restaurant in phoenix . arizona is not exactly know to be a wet place , so fish in the desert seems risky . however , considering the freshness of the salmon from our appetizer , i took the risk . i 'm glad i did . the swordfish was , in all honesty , some of the best seafood i have ever had . it was probably among the top five seafood dishes i have ever eaten . anywhere . the fish was fresh , flakey , cooked just right , and seasoned in a way that brought out the natural goodness of the swordfish steak . they did n't have to hide subpar fish under a wave of spices . this was good fish , and they made it shine . my girlfriend 's pasta was also very good . it was a nice blend of flavors , and the pasta was cooked to perfection . for dessert , we had their take on tiramisu . once again i could have set myself up for disappointment because tiramisu is hands down my favorite dessert of all time , but once again , veneto delivered . the flavors were rich yet balanced , and the chocolate they topped it off with played nicely with the traditional mascarpone and espresso . we also imbibed with some kind of boozy amaretto dessert coffee drink . it , too , was delicious . it was the prefect sweet ending to a very memorable meal . veneto is , quite simply , brilliant , and they provided me with one of my most memorable dining experiences ever . i ca n't recommend this place enough . even before i moved here i was recommending it to my friends when they traveled to phoenix . it 's a great meal in a great atmosphere , and honestly , it 's a great value . i would pay twice as much as i paid for my meal . seriously , try this place . you will not be disappointed !		5		1
was on a break at work at 3pm two days ago considering wildfish for happy hour , so i called first to see if i could speak w / a kitchen manager or chef re food allergies and soon was speaking to sous chef matt . since i 've had happy hour -lrb- 1/2 off select apps -rrb- there before - i 've not had the pleasure of having dinner , yet - i already knew i loved the all lump crabcake -lrb- reg . $ 14.95 -rrb- and the crispy cashew calamari -lrb- $ 12.95 ? -rrb- . knowing that many asian recipes use * i asked matt if the calamari salad contained any -lrb- i recalled that the salad had * as a garnish -rrb- - the answer was yes . that left me w / the crabcake . did wildfish use ** in preparation ? no on the * , but yes on the * -lrb- the remoulade that came w / the crabcake also contained * -rrb- , but if i were to call in the morning and let them know i was going to have dinner there , he 'd be able to make a batch of * - free crabcake and remoulade . i lamented that i was actually going to head over there at 4p , but ... immediately , matt said he 'd have a special batch ready for me , no problem -lrb- !! -rrb- . i also spotted maine lobster bisque on the online menu and had asked matt if roux or * was used as a thickener -lrb- if * , then i could n't have it -rrb- , but , like most quality restaurants , wildfish uses only roux . upon hearing this tidbit , i was excited and looking forward to having a bowl of bisque , the crabcake app , and a glass of cabernet ! as soon as i walked into the restaurant , i was warmly accosted by the host , who informed me that i could sit anywhere i wanted . i asked her if i could speak with matt and was told he 'd be informed i was there . while i waited , i perused through the menu and found that bv signet chardonnay , merlot , and cab sauvignon were the select wines selling for $ 5 a glass during happy hour , so i chose the cab . i also ordered a bowl of the lobster bisque . a few minutes passed by , my delicious cab arrived -lrb- i love the wine glasses there ! -rrb- , and soon i was speaking to matt in person , who must have spent at least 20 minutes w / me -lrb- in addition to the time he spent on the phone w / me earlier -rrb- throughout my time there looking over the menu and seeing which items i could try and which were off-limits . it 's so refreshing to know that there are restaurants who have staff who are willing to take the time to listen to their customers and be willing to tweak their recipes so that people w / food issues may still enjoy many menu options . i was happy to learn that afternoon , that most , if not all , the seafood dishes could be adjusted , either by leaving off one or more ingredients , or by substituting a different sauce -lrb- which many restaurants are unwilling to do , it seems - something to do w / quality control -rrb- or vegetable side . the topic of desserts came up soon enough , so for those with corn allergies , you 'll be happy to know that the cinnamon-raisin bread pudding and hot chocolate godiva cake , as well as the hot apple & cinnamon cobbler -lrb- minus the ice cream - it contains corn syrup -rrb- and creme brulee -lrb- minus the cookies - they contain baking powder , but do n't worry , he 'll substitute fresh berries , instead ! -rrb- are safe to enjoy . i of course adored the special crabcake matt prepared for me - i confess i was so smitten by it , that i had two crabcake dishes -lrb- matt was gracious enough to whip up another batch for me ! -rrb- along w / the table bread and butter . i must mention that as i was sipping a few tablespoonsfuls of the bisque , matt stopped by to let me know that it contained a couple of ingredients i mentioned needing to avoid , so he promptly took the soup out of my sight . no worries , though , as this left me more room for that second crabcake ! -lrb- sadly , i did exhibit allergy symptoms all day wednesday ... -rrb- -lrb- hope you enjoy the photos . love that ice mountain adorned with shellfish ! fyi , fresh-shucked oysters are 50c during happy hour !! -rrb-		5		1
if there is anything i 'd miss if i were to leave phoenix , it would have to be the mexican food . that 's what we 're good for -lrb- and to think we 're trying to get rid of the mexicans ! -rrb- . there 's awesome greasy hole-in-the-wall , everybody-speaks-spanish places like el tlacoyo and moreno 's in mesa ; there 's a variety of fast food places like filiberto 's and someburros ; you have you generic family restaurant mexican like macayo 's , garcia 's , and tia rosa 's ; and then you have your niche places . la condesa is one of those niche places , and one of my favorites . here , their niche is a slightly fancy take on really simple items like tacos , salsa , and quesadillas . the tacos come in several varieties , with meats including chicken , beef , pork , whitefish , and even dogfish shark , and different spices and toppings on each one . my favorites are , of course , the shark , as well as the black mole , and one of the beef ones -lrb- not the sonoran -rrb- . the salsas are also a big draw : prepare to be blown away as you dip your chips in peanut salsa , strawberry salsa , cilantro salsa , or even my personal favorite , pecan salsa . there are typically about 20 choices , so if you want to try them all , come with a few friends -lrb- it does get crowded , though -rrb- . the quesadillas are also delicious ; they 're a southern mexican fried style . they 're quite heavy , so do n't plan on being able to eat two or three tacos * and * a quesadilla . oh ... and get the horchata . you wo n't regret it . i wo n't describe it , just because i do n't want to ruin the surprise . but it will blow your mind . whenever i get it , which is always , someone always asks me what that delicious-looking beverage is .		5		1
super friendly , fast service . cute cafe with lots of art and natural light . i got the tomato basil and brie frittata with potatoes and sourdough toast , a side of bacon , and a coffee all for $ 20 after tip . the frittata was larger than i expected with plenty of tomatoes and brie . the potatoes are seasoned red which made me a little apprehensive since i can not handle spicy food at all , but they were very flavourful and went down easy . the toast was delicious with a nice creamy butter . the bacon -lrb- an extra at $ 2 for three pieces -rrb- was great and totally worth the price . very good coffee with unlimited top ups at $ 2.49 . you can also get your food to-go but if you 're not in a hurry , stick around for the service . definitely recommend this local eatery . i 'll be back to try the french toast !		5		1
exquisitely crafted meals that wo n't leave you disappointed , nor hungry afterwards ! i tried the squash blossom appetizer , which was cooked perfectly , had great flavor , with a nice crispy , crunchy breadcrumb batter . the fish of the day was grouper , which was crusted with hazelnuts . again , cooked perfectly , with great crunch to the crust . the meals themselves , while pricey , will definitely leave you full , and the presentation of the dishes is very nice . the one thing that is weird -lrb- and not part of the groupon agreement i thought -rrb- is that they will automatically add 18 % tip to your bill if you are a groupon user .		5		1
the first time i had a pasty was while i was in bath , not far from stonehenge . fast forward a few years , i 'm told of cornish pasty co. . dang , these things are the best ! i typically call in my order and by the time i arrive -lrb- 10-15 mins . -rrb- it is all ready for me to take home . oddly , i usually do this on days when i 'm hurting from a terrible hangover . their menu , which is available online , has so many options and they all seem freaking incredible . however , when i 'm hungover i usually want something very filling and comforting . so the very first pasty i called in was a shepherd 's pie , then i 'm asked if i want lamb -lrb- a true shepherd 's pie -rrb- or beef -lrb- a cottage pie -rrb- . lamb , of course ! it was so delicious it 's the only one i 've ever gotten . i just ca n't seem to bring myself to deviate and that 's not really like me , especially when everyone raves about all the others . someday . i 'll surely be going back , maybe one day i 'll actually eat there and enjoy the ambiance and maybe , just maybe i 'll try something new . this place rocks ! the service is great and they 're all so friendly !		5		1
i was far too embarassed about my first visit to the morning glory cafe to do a proper yelp . my advice : do n't take vitamins on a empty hangover stomach then allow your breakfast buddy to order really jiggly eggs benedict . every bump to the table was pure torture for hypersensitive gag reflex . but despite my unflattering visit to restroom trailer , i absolutely loved the food and knew i would be back . today i managed to convince my husband to go to the farm for breakfast , which is a minor feat in and of itself . but i am happy to report that the breakfast was just as awesome as i promised my hubby that it would be . - the setting is beautiful , green , and soothing - the beverages are far above average . coffee that does n't get bitter as it cools and freshly squeezed orange juice . - the staff is friendly and wonderful . - the meal comes out ridiculously quick . it makes me wonder what takes so long at other breakfast joints . - the food is divine . the omelets are the best omelets i have ever eaten with fresh ingredients from the farm within sight of our table . we even heard the chickens while we were sitting there because it was early and the restaurant was nearly empty . the rosemary potatoes are perfectly seasoned and cooked . the hubby was equally impressed with his simple breakfast of eggs , bacon and pancakes with real maple syrup . he even noticed that the portion size was perfect and that substandard breakfast restaurants compensate for mediocre meals with a greater quantity of food . - the meal is a bit pricey for breakfast , but i did n't mind one bit . i ca n't afford regular visits but i really wish i could . we paid $ 37 for two meals , two coffees and 1 screwdriver -lrb- not on the menu , but they have the ingredients -rrb- . - i do have one complaint , but i 'm not sure if it 's really a complaint or just a personal preference . i hate biscuits . they taste like dehydrated unbaked dough and i have no idea why any human would willingly eat one . morning glory cafe 's biscuit is as horrible as any other i have tried . maybe for you biscuit-eaters out there it may actually be decent . - i felt like a humungous dork for doing this , but we talked about the breakfast for hours . it was incredibly tasty and we kept discussing it to verify that we both experienced this perfect breakfast and to reinforce our experience .		5		1
like mexican food i 've always found it impossible to find my favorite italian restaurant . . well look no further because i found my favorite italian place in the valley . funny that i live on the west side and had no idea this place existed . it 's just north of bell of 459th ave. easy to miss if you 're not looking for it . right as you walk inside it has that family italian feel to it . awesome decor all around . a bar on the right as you walk in and then the rest of the restaurant is on the inside . ive been here a few times and i 'll tell what i 've had . the first time i had their baked spaghetti and wow . . it was tasty ! every bite better than the next . they also bring out fresh bread for dipping in oil and balsamic vinagar . makes it that much better . my favorite dish so far . . eggplant parmesan . holy . . this dish was insane . im not even an eggplant fan and i couldnt get enough . the meal is definitely big enough to split for two . however they do offer a single portion . i highly recommend this delicious place !		5		1
wow ! finally a restaurant in the desert that has me head over heels . location , service , freshness , menu , view , large but intimate dinning room , i can go on ! it was valentines day , our 10th year anniversary-last minute date with this being our 20th choice . they were wide open , no reservations needed . not only are they located in the heart and soul of downtown . it is so close to the new convention center , that several times during the meal i had the urge to reach out and grab the building to pull us closer ; as i chose the table closest to the edge on the patio near the convention center and sat right in the center of the table looking out . the view was so breathtaking , i almost forgot we ordered the best appetizer ever ! the classic sampler included roasted garlic prawns over tasty mashed potatoes , teriyaki tenderloin over rice , hot red king crab and artichoke dip served with the tastiest bread sticks . everything was superb ! this could have easily been a meal in itself . we shared a salad at the suggestion of the waiter-expecting a portion that could be shared , but received the smallest-most delicious salad . it was served chopped style -lrb- yup this is the real deal when it comes to chop houses -rrb- with a delicious ranch dressing . next time we will each order our own because i wanted more ! i did n't mind as it made more room for the bottle of wine -lrb- half off on saturdays for bottles of wine and champagne-lucky us ! -rrb- . i ordered the grilled north atlantic maine lobster tails which were served with grilled asparagus , melted butter for dipping and fresh lemon . brian ordered the bone in rib eye 20 oz . which is creekstone farms ' premium black angus beef , corn fed and aged 28 days for flavor and tenderness . all steaks are grilled and seasoned with custom rub , then topped with steakhouse butter . served with crispy buttermilk onion strings and red jacket mashed potatoes . it was so delicious i had to copy and paste the menu as this is one restaurant that is sure to be tried even just once . if your a phoenician or a lover of phoenix as i , then you can finally be proud to know that downtown phoenix is the home to one of the best chop houses in all of my 16 country travels !!!!		5		1
veggie korma . the best veggie korma ever . i have dreams about thier veggie korma . beautiful dreams . and naan , i 'm always a big fan of naan , they do not disappoint . the fiancé and i have tried a variety of their meat dishes during our visits ; have yet to find anything we were n't a fan of . we have since switched to only enjoying this fine establishment during their buffet lunch , because hey we are in a recession in case you have n't heard , and even thought their prices are n't bad my indian food habit was getting a little pricey . the lunch buffet is very inexpensive , and you have enjoy all the delicious fluffy naan you can handle . it 's a great way to try out different dishes , especially since the hubby claims that he `` does n't like lamb '' this makes it possible for me to indulge in marys little friend without battling it out with him . i do however wish they would serve veggie korma during their lunch buffet more often , because once again , delicious . though when i 've called to ask if they had it in the past they did put some out , so i think they are pretty much the nicest people ever .		5		1
oh man , it 's time for the fried food festivities at the fair again ! now , on sundays , it 's 2 bucks before 2pm to get in -lrb- it use to be free before 11am -rrb- . and parking goes way up around 11am . we pulled into one of the side street lots and got parking for 5 bucks . as we were walking out , they changed the sign to 10 bucks , and then again to 15 bucks ! it was the same as last year ... hot , full of greasy food , and more tattoo 'd / booty short wearin/large panus people than you can shake a stick at ! which is why it 's so damn fun . we notice 4peaks was doing a beer exhibition and show , but that never materialized . we did buy the 35 dollar all you can ride wrist bands and made it onto about 5 rides , but then we got tired of standing in lines for over 30 minutes , so we spent the rest of the time wandering around and eating horribly . on that note , the deep fried watermelon was actually pretty darn good -lrb- it should be a 8.50 -rrb- . the deep fried nutella was gooey goodness as expected . i was n't impressed with the deep fried reese cup . what blew us a way was the deep fried lasagna . we read that it was super good and they were correct . the dough was thin , just on the outside layer of pasta , and it was super crispy and salty . the lasagna itself was very tasty ... thick marinara with plenty of spinach and mushrooms and cheese . our favorite food at the fair in many years . go early on the weekends and buy a 1 dollar water outside the gate , but do n't open it -lrb- you are allowed unopened beverages -rrb- because once inside , that same water will cost 3 bucks . otherwise ... enjoy the atrocity that is the az state fair !		5		1
durant 's is everything a steakhouse should be . dimly lit with a somewhat mafia like gangstery feeling warm atmosphere , professional and prompt no b.s. service with the best tasting 12 oz filet i have ever had . the walk through the kitchen is a nice touch , especially when leaving because you get a chance to thank the chefs that made that mouthwatering slab of perfection you just gorged on . i do n't mind paying a bit more for a meal like i had last night . and they do n't skimp on the pours , my martini was filled to the brim which is just how it should be . mastros can take their pretentious wait staff and long speeches about how their cows are hand fed grass by some old farmer and his wife in ohio and seasoned with blah blah blah , seared in a 1200 degree oven and served with bleh blipitty bloop and if i order it rare it will have a cool pink center etc -lrb- i think i know what rare is -rrb- ... just give me the gd steak and make it amazing like durant 's did and let me enjoy my company and my meal . i ca n't wait to go back ! p.s. . their bearnaise sauce was great too .		5		1
my people ... ... the vig uptown still rules but they now charge an extra dollar for that gluten free bun . just started . hey , monday still makes it a $ 6 burger and fries , so i 'm all good ! we get there a little after 5 now and take advantage of some half price appetizers ! then at 6 we put our burger order in . we are cheap but the food is not ! value , quality and great service . sometimes you wait when they 're packed but who cares ? best darn value on monday in town ! nicole is my favorite waitress !!! ask nice and they 'll sell you some dip for the sweet potato fries !! -lrb- i can not duplicate it at home but still want it when i fry them myself ! -rrb-		5		1
go to this place . tucked away in a little residential-esque building , angels trumpet ale house is the coolest new place in roro to grab some brews . i went here with my older brother on a friday after work and the place was popping . strolled through the door -lrb- whose handle is an entire broomstick , wicked cool looking -rrb- and grabbed a table by the big bay windows over looking the patio . not quite full yet but within 20 minutes the place was full and the patio was too . people really like this place . the beer was good , i got a cider and it was very tasty . we were n't that hungry so we split the meat treat pizza and it was bomb . the bacon was nice and crunchy and the veggies were n't slimy or overwhleming like they tend to be on flat bread pizza . i can not wait to go back here , especially this fall when the patio -lrb- which overlooks dowtown phx -rrb- is nice and cool and enjoy plenty o drinks .		5		1
my bf and i were in the area and looking for a place to eat on friday night . we were n't sure what to eat so of course we had to pull up yelp and of course yelp saves the day because this place was amazing ! i 've never heard of it and neither one of us has ever had caribbean food before so we wanted to try something new and i 'm so glad we did ! he ordered the rumbi beach burger combination which comes with fries and a drink while i ordered the island chicken jerk sandwich . we always try to order different things at new restaurants so we can both experience something new and see what we like . we 're both actually kind of competitive because we like seeing who ordered the better dish lol . and in this case apparently he won ! his burger was so amazingly mouth watering ! he said he almost did n't even want to give me his half of it ! haha . my sandwich was also good but not as good as his . everything was so good at this restaurant . even the fries and the special sauce that came with it was amazing ! not to mention the price is sooooo reasonable . i think the only negative thing i have to say is i wish the location was easier to find . we had to drive around for a while to find it , but it was definitely worth it in the end . = -rrb- the staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu . i 'm so glad we found this place on yelp because i will definitely be coming back . all this talk is making me want to ditch work and go get one right now ! trust me folks , you wo n't be disappointed . = -rrb-		5		1
jenny r and i popped in here this afternoon . i 've walked by a few times and noticed the long lines and crowds inside . i had to see what the fuss was about . i 'm very impressed . this is my new favorite burger spot . they have normal size burgers -lrb- i.e. huge -rrb- as well as mini versions . i got a mini because i 'm watching my figure and it was the perfect size burger for me . the burger comes naked as a jaybird . if you want something on it -lrb- and they have quite a list of toppings -rrb- you have to specify . the burger was one of the best i 've ever had in my life . perhaps it was the grilled onions and mushrooms . the cajun fries were smothered in spice and made my tongue sweat . i liked it ! -lrb- `` small '' must mean `` enormous . '' get a small and you can easily split it was a friend or two . -rrb- five guys was n't any more pricey than any other burger spot around town . the mini burger and small cajun fries came to $ 6.50 ish . -lrb- no drink for me . i only drink water , and that 's always free . -rrb- i 'm only going here for burgers from now on . i 'm very pleased to see this on mill ave.		5		1
i came here on the opening night when someone from gin blossoms played on a makeshift stage , the beers were 25 cents and there was no food -lrb- but you know me , we ordered a pizza from a neighborhood pizza place . -rrb- since then , they have added a full kitchen and the food is amazing -lrb- chicken strips that were designed for diners who appreciate tempura-like batter and are over the age of four -rrb- , the beer is astounding -lrb- one word : kolsch ... makes me swoon -rrb- and the people are great . it 's worth the walk wherever you end up finding a space to park -- even better , ride your bike over like we do ! the sunday brunch is great . all of my friends sit and wish they had a student loan that would enable them to spend at least half of the day drinking here daily . i do n't blame them .		5		1
holy $ @ * % ! i love this place ! after reading the weekly yelp for last week , i knew that i had to try this place . it was well worth the hour drive from the west valley . when we first got there for happy hour , the bar area was full . we found a corner to sit at at the bar and the couple next to us kindly moved over to give us more space . the bartender asked us what we wanted to drink and i went with a mango mule kick . it was delicious ! after that i ordered the bistro mojito . it 's a little on the sweet side , which i love . now for the food . we started with the steak tartare . i do n't pass up a chance to eat steak tartare . it 's my favorite ! it came in a jar with toast and a raw quail egg . yum ! next we tried the short rib sliders ; i would recommend to a friend . then we tried the calamari . it 's not breaded or deep fried , it 's grilled and delicious . after that we had the blt camelback burger . what a great burger ! i think what made the evening even better was the bill . i have paid more at yard house for happy hour . now , there is nothing wrong with the yard house , but it does n't come close to the quality of food from blt steak !		5		1
i came here by myself on a thursday during happy hour , since sadly none of my , `` friends '' had the time or desire to join me !! : -lrb- well , they missed out !!! this place is perky , colorful and clean . i had the chicken tacos from the hh menu as well as a prickly pear mojito and that was spectacular , and to top it all off i indulged myself with a milk chocolate tres leches cake . and that was just okay !!! i 've made and had way better ones ' !!! overall , great little place . and hopefully next time i will bring someone along !!! my server was great , she was very attentive and well knowledged on the menu items !!! great place !! *** you deserve an a + + : -rrb-		5		1
met some colleagues here for dinner one evening . located in the scottsdale quarter , this high end restaurant is a great place for dinner . if you 're price sensitive , this is not the place for you ... do n't even bother . our reservation was for 6:45 pm and it was jam packed , good thing we called ahead . we were promptly seated in the main dining room . after browsing the extensive menu , i decided to order : baby iceberg blt wedge - -lrb- bacon , maytag blue cheese , buttermilk-chive dressing -rrb- , $ 9 twin lobster tails - broiled , mkt price truffle mac 'n cheese , $ 6 -lrb- for small portion -rrb- godiva chocolate w/vanilla ice cream all of the food was excellent . the twin lobster tails were perfect and came with butter to dip them in . they were so good , i used very little butter . i enjoyed the broiled flavor on it 's own . the truffle mac 'n cheese was very rich & creamy , amazing . the blt wedge was very good too , but the portion was too large and i had to leave 1/2 of it because i did n't want to be full when my entree came out . at the urging of my colleagues , i ordered the godiva chocolate w/vanilla ice cream . it was awesome , but very rich . i had to split it with everyone because there was no way i could finish it after the big meal . the hot godiva chocolate oozed out of the center of the cake ... and the vanilla ice cream complimented it perfectly . the service here was impeccable . they have a great staff . ca n't wait for my next visit . return factor - 100 %		5		1
wow . i 'm embarassed i did n't know about this place earlier . and i call myself a phoenician ? i came here for dinner last night after reading the review by sabrina , who ought to be awarded the nobel prize for something for discovering this place . i almost do n't want to write this review because it 'll spoil the surprises you 're in store for when you visit . it begins when you pull into the parking lot and eye the shady looking exterior , but then step inside . the owner has gone to great lengths to decorate with a unique theme of mexican life on the sea . i was charmed the instant i opened the door . the menu is your next surprise . not one item on the first three pages is anything you 've ordered before at any other mexican restaurant . the dishes are all seafood based , including crab , octopus , and lots of shrimp . what says it all is the description on the last page of the menu that offers `` mexican food '' , where you can get the standard fare of cheese enchiladas etc. . what i say next i do not say lightly . as of right now , this place serves the best , # 1 , salsa in the state of arizona . this is based on a lifetime growing up in this state and sampling salsas hundreds upon hundreds of times at our best mexican restaurants from ajo to tucson to springerville . when my dinner companion told the owner how much she liked the salsa he remarked to us that it was a new recipe . there are actually two salsas that come with the chips , one a reddish green variety and the other being avocado-based . the avocado based one is also excellent , but it 's the reddish green one that simply blows me away with its combination of flavor and just the right amount of spiciness . we wolfed it down so quickly he brought us a second bowl within minutes of our sitting down . our next surprise came after we ordered our entrees . the owner walked up to our table and put down two small plates of what i can only describe as seafood tostadas . this is evidently yet another free appetizer that comes with all meals . picture a mini-tostada shell , on top of which is a well-marinated collection of what i think were tiny pieces of salmon , tomato , onion and green peppers . everything fresh and with just a bit of a kick to it . again , wow . my entree was good , though i 'll definitely order something new next time . the crab enchiladas come with a unique style of preparing the rice and beans , and a fresh salad as well . i was n't a huge fan of the crab filling to be honest , but not because of quality or preparation reasons , more so my own personal taste . i 'm going for a shrimp dish next time . the owner was serving customers himself when i was there and he 's an extremely friendly and polite mexican gentleman . he 's created a gem in this part of midtown phoenix which is n't particularly known for its restaurants .		5		1
there 's a cute little spot that is in the middle of the parking lot for the vig . because of the exterior facade it actually looks like it could be part of the the vig 's property , low and behold , its a remodeled taco bell with cool wood paneling , a small dedicated parking lot to the south side and some of the best offerings for a full service breakfast place this side of ... 1st street and scottsdale road , south of camelback ... i am doing my best to keep my loyalties and boundaries ! ... and , i think its important for me to note , i am an aaron may fan . i think what he has done is awesome . i appreciate the commitment to quality he consistently provides his guests , be it at sol y sombra or over easy . he might charge a higher price than most expect , but it is worth it ! on my last visit -lrb- i 've been several times -rrb- , we came in the middle of the week and had blueberry pancakes -lrb- 10-star-worthy -rrb- , toast with a side of apple butter -lrb- that was out of this world -rrb- and i had an egg-white/asparagus omelet -lrb- that was delicious , but much too healthy -rrb- . let it be noted : aaron 's menu does n't provide for many ` low carb ' options as sides . no fruit , tomatoes or cottage cheese . only toast , potatoes , hash browns . me and my waistline had to get over it quickly , i did , and i still come back again and again . our server was attentive , patient and aware that we were talking disproportionately to our eating , but gave us plenty of room to drink 15-cups of the freshly brewed coffee , time to try each other 's meals and , again , lament that i was being way too healthy for what the menu offers . all of it is delicious . the food , service and ambiance are great and the space heaters on the patio actually work . i would easily conduct anything from a business day breakfast meeting to anything similar to a hang-your-head-low-because-we-drank-too-much and need some good bacon grease to absorb the bourbon meeting here too , for an `` over easy '' -lrb- not that i 've ever done anything like it -rrb- . seriously though , aaron and his team have surrounded themselves with good people that provide friendly , hospitable service . when you return , you 'll find aaron 's friends are his most regular guests and his parents and/or his sister and his wife are usually stopping by on the weekends - it says a lot when your friends and family come around all the time , because no matter what , they 're going to love you - if they 're going to pay a tab , and love you , the food must be damn good .		5		1
i had intended to give this sandwich place four stars - because it seemed excessive to give any sandwich place five stars -- but hey , on reflection what could they do better to get that extra star ? nothing - so five stars it is . really big inventive menu . big thick sandwiches -lrb- breakfast and lunch -rrb- made on demand , but still fast . fresh healthy ingredients -lrb- mostly ! -rrb- with super polite service . and reasonably priced ! you 'll leave a buck or two richer compared to paradise cafe/bakery . i do n't work in an office , but understand they 're great for take-out -lrb- hence the name -rrb- when you 're ordering a large lunch group . plus they have my favorite thing in the world on the menu even though it 's not a sandwich : a heaping bowl of angel hair pasta with homemade marinara plus add-ins like two small meatballs for $ 1.50 or grilled onions/peppers/mushrooms for 50 cents each . i 'd give them 5 + stars if they added a `` pasta with the works '' option which gave you all four things i just mentioned for less than a $ 3 total add-on . but now i 'm being greedy - love this place .		5		1
dear revolving sushi inventor , i fell in love with you today , thank you for your contribution to our society . when my coworker invited me to check out this place with her i jumped at the chance . although i was a little nervous that it was so cheap , i was determined to replace my qualms with a sense of adventure . luckily , we arrived for lunch at 11:00 , i know it 's early but by 11:30 eager sushi eaters started coming out of the woodwork and had to wait for a seat . as we sat down the server took our drink orders and gave us our drinks rather quickly . that was the last time we saw her until the check came . i ca n't say enough good things about what it 's like to sit down at your table and already have the food in front of you . the first thing i tried was the salmon sashimi it was honestly one of the best pieces of salmon i 've ever had . next i tried the tuna sashimi , meh , not so much . everything after that was delicious . my coworker and i just kept grabbing and grabbing . the plates ranged from $ 1.00 - $ 2.00 . when our bill came it was $ 26 , for both of us ! stop what you 're doing and go eat there , you will not be disappointed .		5		1
it 's been almost 8 months since i 've said anything about scott 's here , so a little update is in order , eh ? dropped back in here for the severaleth time -lrb- i 've been listening to sarah palin ! -rrb- for lunch today , joined by some of my great yelp friends , arllin b , robyn n , & mike c ! this time i ordered a big bowl of their terrific kreplach soup & an -lrb- also big -rrb- half a hot pastrami sandwich on rye . everything was great , just as it has been every time i have been here , & our server jan was lovely ! my order was $ 11.95 , & it 's still a big 5 stars for scott 's generations ! : -- rrb - -rrb- ps : crown china super buffet in this same center is good too !		5		1
fox restaurants typically are delicious , but people like myself and other yelpers are weary of chain restaurants and although this is the only arrogant butcher and not a chain like sauce or true food its easy to lump it together into a `` chain restaurant motif '' being a fox restaurant . fact of the matter is that 's not fair , this unlike a quick in and out concept like sauce , its a sit down restaurant that turns out to be excellent . i 've read reviews where people were disappointed with the quality , i think those people just drove out of there way maybe living in the west valley or something and amp ` ed it up too highly , kinda like when you see a movie and it sucks then its better the next time . either way i 've been here 3 times and every time had a delicious meal every time . one thing that 's really cool about this restaurant is that they give you an `` antipasto '' menu that looks like a sushi bar menu -lrb- single sheet of papter you can mark on with a pencil -rrb- full of various cheeses , meats and extras -lrb- grilled asparagus , olives , elephant garlic , $ 1 mussels , etc. -rrb- this allows you to get your appetizers going right away . whats great about this is not only the concept but the meats and cheeses are high quality and come with bread and jam that 's honestly to die for , so delicious ! i could go for the antipasto menu alone . to eat i 've tried the turkey sloppy joe , which sounds dumb , in defense of the sandwich first off it was lunch and it came with a grilled poblano chili on top , it was amazing . i 've also for dinner tried the sweet baked potato tortellini -lrb- excellent -rrb- and my favorite thing so far which i will re order is the beef short rib stew with green chiles , fried egg , cornbread . the flavor with the egg is mindbogglingly awesome and the cornbread is fresh , moist and delicious . i 've never had a bad meal and/or experience here , after here -lrb- as far as other bars @ citiscape -rrb- is a different story because i have an alcohol problem : -rrb-		5		1
the first time i came here was with my husband on my birthday , during december 2010 . it was by accident . we were just going to go to postinos , but it was ridiculously crowded , so he said , `` why do n't we try that place over there instead ? '' we walked over to aiellos and checked out the menu , and immediately decided to give it a try . the host watched us and smiled and said , `` i knew you guys would come in ! '' and it was all over from there ! that night i had the veal parmigiana . it was really , really good ! my husband had one of their raviolis . the service was absolutely wonderful ! at the end of dinner , even joe stopped by to say , `` hi ! '' he usually has a surprise at the end of dinner too and makes it a point to greet everyone with this surprise game . if you guess correctly , your dinner is on them ! it 's true ! i know this because one of my best friends won a free dinner for her and her husband when they went there for new year 's ! ever since that night , whenever there is a special occasion , we go there , even if it 's a 40 minute drive away . the osso bucco was delicous and tender when we went there for my best friend 's birthday , and so is the veal marsala which my husband and i had for our 4th wedding anniversary this past september . i always try to order a different dish each time , but it 's hard when you already found dishes that you love . my guitar instructor , who grew up with his family in new jersey , loves this place after i recommended it to him . he , his wife , and his entire huge east coast originating family are regulars at aiellos now . i always ask him for recommendations on true italian dishes that aiellos makes , and they always turn out tasty and amazing ! this place feels so quaint and intimate ! it feels like a `` local '' restaurant which is refreshing compared to having to go to chain restaurants all the time ! i miss having places like these , where the owner recognizes you when you come in and treats you like family ! not many places have that feel anymore .		5		1
lunch : came here for a late lunch pre-dinner snack . even though it was prior to happy hour we were still offered to order from the tapas menu . we decided to share the blue prawn blt sandwich from the lunch menu and the fried calamari from the tapas menu -lrb- see pics -rrb- the sandwich was just delicious i loved every bite of the chewy ciabatta , the butter lettuce , pimento spread , the tender grilled prawns and the flavorful bacon ! the accompanying fries were hot , fresh and tasty crisp too ! the calamari was very fresh and tender , loved that as well ! the waiter was oblivious and had to be waved down just so we could pay and get out of there . we were one of 2 or 3 couples in the restaurant at this time and service was painfully slow , thank god for the generous bread basket , which by the way had several varieties of fresh bread with olive oil for dipping . dinner : the bar was packed with obvious locals dining on hh tapas and drinks . the restaurant itself was pretty full as well . we were seated right away and greeted by our server ashley who despite being very busy took very good care of us and was very knowledgeable about the menu . we started with a wild arugula salad and fried zucchini blossoms . -lrb- see pics -rrb- both were absolutely divine . the salad was lightly dressed and served atop this thin crisp bread/cracker then topped with tomato and spanish cheese i would liken to a more pungent parmesan . delicious ! the squash blossom were filled with ricotta , mozzarella and salami ... wow ! these were amazingly tasty i wish there were more of them ! for our entrees my husband chose the rigatoni with bacon and i chose the pork chop -lrb- see pics -rrb- ashley our server explained that this was carabuda pork , the finest pig in the world and let me tell you it did not disappoint ! served on top of brown rice with toasted pine nuts and figs drizzled with grape must , it was just unbelievably good , better than a steak . i highly recommend it , my husband loved it as well , i shared with him and he was just in awe of how good it was . his pasta was delicious as well with fresh tomato sauce , basil and bacon ! yum ! for we ordered the churros and a peach tart -lrb- see pics -rrb- if you 've never had a fresh churro you do n't know what your missing ! omg ! they were fabulous ! the peach tart was quite yummy too though i though it could have used more peaches ! breakfast buffet : on the weekend they serve the buffet with a couple menu items . it was just ok , their fresh fruit was good , the omelet bar was so-so , service again was slow , waiting for drink and salt and pepper , they were missing bowls for the oatmeal . not much to say here . wrap up : i would absolutely eat here again just not for breakfast . dinner was amazing and our lunch was delicious too despite waiting a bit too ling . i must give 5 stars for our food during dinner though !		5		1
i can not believe i have n't reviewed this place ! i love the lost leaf . it 's rare that my husband and i ever get out without the kiddos , but when we do , lost leaf is almost always on the agenda . it 's such a laid back vibe , we ca n't help but really enjoy ourselves . i love that the music is in a different area so you 're not so crowded when you sit down to have a drink . and for how small the place is , it 's surprisingly roomy once you get inside . love the art on the walls and the crowd is always great . i feel like the limited beer and wine menu keeps the frat boys out and the ` normals ' in . major perk . we usually have an ace pear , grab a table , and chit chat with all of our friends . i really love this place , i 'm happy to see it flourish .		5		1
love this place even though the parking is difficult and it has a tendency to have toothless crackheads from the neighborhood hangin in front sometimes ... so , you 're not going anywhere fancy . they make on the spot agua frescas which are fruit and ice whipped up and delivered to your table in a big goblet with an umbrella on it . i love the umbrella touch . the melon -lrb- cantaloupe -rrb- one i get every time has never let me down with it 's refreshing taste ... i feel so healthy drinking it ! ... . . and then the massive torta comes , and every healthy thing takes a backseat to these things . i '' ve never been able to finish one , and i do n't even order the real big ones . i always get the norteno with beef , and it is always awesome ! steak , onions , peppers , cheeses , like an entire avocado and this great sauce . . plus he grills the rolls to bring even more flavor . i hope to eat here again soon !		5		1
ah , in-n-out . it was september 6 , 1950 , & my dad scored a new powder blue '51 chevy convertible to surprise my mom with for her birthday . she put me & the big pink ribbon & bow inside , & we took off , hair in the wind , down baldwin ave. to highway 66 & east over to in-n-out , in nearby baldwin park . this was to be not only my first ride in a convertible & my first hamburger , but i think also my first meal ever at a restaurant ! -lrb- mom learned that 3-year-olds do n't like raw onions ! -rrb- this was not only the first in-n-out , but it might have been the only `` fast food '' drive-in restaurant anywhere at the time ! highway 66 is gone now , but amazingly , that in-n-out is still there , & the regular burgers & fries have n't changed a bit ! -lrb- `` old 66 '' here is now the service road for the 10 freeway . -rrb- hamburger -lrb- animal style -rrb- $ 1.75 , fries -lrb- well done -rrb- $ 1.35 , chocolate shake $ 1.95 = $ 5.05 yes , we have 5 guys & smashburger , & they 're both great , but they 're not the same thing . the magic is at in-n-out . special magic !! : -- rrb - -rrb-		5		1
wow . just wow . what liz said . what jared said . what nearly everyone else has said . this place is fantastic . it may be a little hard to find . a white building w / no traditional signage , we only found it because of the banner on one side that said `` chinese food '' on it . like liz said , no ambiance at all , except for the food . i had chicken fried rice and some spicy wontons , both fantastic . the wonton broth was super spicy , so good . and since we had such a big group , it was very much family style . every single thing i tried was great if not better than that . the flavors were amazing . several of the dishes had szechuan peppers -lrb- very spicy -rrb- but all used in different ways . the lamb -lrb- all 3 variations i tried -rrb- was tender and flavorful . the bitter melon is definitely an acquired taste . there is a bit of a language barrier between the wait staff and guests , im guessing thats the reason that every dish on the menu is written in english and chinese . have some patience and be prepared to have one of the best meals available in the valley .		5		1
love , love , love this place . i have been meaning to visit this place for a while . with restaurant week available , we decided to try it . i had a fabulous meal . i went with the restaurant week menu , while my hubby decided he wanted the enchiladas for an appetizer . my appetizer was awesome . i love beets , yes a lot of people do n't , but i have an obsession with them . this place knows what they are doing . they were perfect , unlike last weeks . delicious red and golden beets with a little goat cheese and pecans . my entree was the salmon , also cooked to perfection , moist and tender . and the piece de resistance was my dessert . i was nice enough to share it with my husband . the fig and pecan pie with a scoop of cream cheese lemon ice cream . i am still thinking about it . the crust of the pie was a piece of art . i am a crust girl , and this was delicious almost like shortbread . ca n't wait to come back .		5		1
i ran off into the night , hair flying , hands clutching both sides of the paper plate . i 'd ordered from pizza people before ; my date had not . ideally , i 'd never let him . the perfectly crisp gluten-free crust , vegan cheese that tasted like rich white cheddar & mozzarella -lrb- rather than vomit -rrb- , and the delicious smattering of mushrooms and basil adorning that personal pizza had won my heart long before he could , and that is how it was destined to stay . after giving up dairy and gluten , all that was left of a pizza was the tomato sauce . somehow , i was enjoying a pizza , sans tomato sauce , dietary restrictions in tact ! crouched behind a graffiti 'd wall , i ravaged that pizza with a passion reserved only for the glory that emerges from the pizza people truck .		5		1
if i keep having flashbacks about my lovely dinner here last night , then it must be worthy of 5 stars . husband and i went here for a late dinner last night on our anniverary-eve . it was a monday , and there were only two other couples there , so it was nice and quiet . the ambience is relaxed and warm , and our server was attentive and informative , but not smothering . we started with a three-cheese plate . they have a long list of cheese varieties from which to choose . we got the truffle tremor -lrb- goat -rrb- , abbaye -lrb- sheep -rrb- and three sisters of serena -lrb- cow -rrb- . it comes with baguette slices , pear slices , strawberries , grapes , dried cranberries , almonds , and a delicious candied-syruppy-dried-fruit-and-nut combination . i ordered the duck for my entree , and it was superb . the duck breast was excellent , but the best part was the blue-cheese-potato croquette and the diced mango and poblano relish . i could have licked my plate . we were too full for dessert , but they looked great . i loved that you can order half-glasses of wine . it gave me a chance to taste a couple of different kinds without a -rrb- breaking the bank , and b -rrb- getting so sloshed that i could n't drive home . i enjoyed everything about my experience here . the only drawback to the entire meal was that the server told us that the mac-and-cheese plate was big enough for a meal , but when it came , it was actually pretty small -lrb- perfect size for a starter -rrb- . husband insisted that it was just enough , but i would have preferred he have a bigger main course . but i digress . expect to pay upwards of $ 50/person if you go all out and order wine , starters , and entrees , but this could easily be an affordable dinner at happy hour or if you just get a few starter plates to share . the portions are adequate , but not really big enough to take home leftovers . i ca n't wait to go back to sample some more wine and cheese !		5		1
we were really happy with our first visit to pomegranate . we went in for sunday breakfast , and were very piqued by the menu and everything else this place has to offer . it 's almost too much to take in at first -- as you glance around , you see lots of interesting stuff that could take a while to explore . the unique menu aside , they have many types of tea and a great selection of coffee . the best part of the menu is that everything is fresh , and most things are configurable with different options depending on whether you 're vegan . i got the breakfast burrito , which is available with egg or tofu . i got tofu and the vegan cheese . i had a little moment with the cashier when i ordered coffee with cream . see , i 'm not a vegan but i was trying the whole vegan experience to see how everything tastes . as soon as i said i wanted cream in my coffee , i realized the paradox and my folly . he kindly offered me vegan options and i chose soy cream after putting his mind at ease and letting him know i was just a vegan poseur . my wife got the french toast . hey , at least i do n't claim to be vegan and go around sneaking bacon whenever it suits me . everything came out within a reasonable amount of time and was absolutely a home run . the burrito was so damned good that i considered eating the three beans i had dropped on the table . it came with fruit and a fresh pico de gallo type thing whose ingredients remain a mystery , but it was delicious . some criticisms i 've read in here are understandable , and in the end this place is n't for everyone . if it gets busy , i could see the food taking a while , but this is a place where everything is made from fresh ingredients . it would take me an hour at home to make the burrito i had this morning . all in all , i do n't give out 5-star ratings often , but this place is deserving . if you want a fresh , delicious meal , whether you are vegan or not , and like a friendly , casual , non-pretentious atmosphere , check it out .		5		1
i 'm adding a star to my original review for a couple of reasons . # 1 -rrb- i 'm totally falling for this place . the last few times i 've been in i 've recieved a lot less attitude from the bar staff . crappy attitudes do n't bother me too much to begin with . i figure that the person in question either has an overinflated ego -lrb- because it takes a pretty high skill level to open beer and poor wine -rrb- or they 're pms ` ing ... whatever . either way , one thing is for certain ... it 's not my problem . it is nice to be warmly received though ... and they are extremely knowledgeable when questioned about the different artists . i felt as though they genuinely gave a shit that words were coming out of my mouth ... how refreshing . ; -- rrb - bringing me to -- # 2 -rrb- the art -lrb- recently -rrb- - let 's just say that i have a couple of new favorite local artists and if things go the way i expect them too , i may not be able to pay my rent next month . the end		5		1
okay , this is the third time i 'm writing about this wonderful restaurant , but i need to talk about it , because if you were like me and only ordering the pho and the egg rolls -lrb- we call them spring rolls in hawaii -rrb- which are spot on , i 'm not saying to stop . but , next time you go , make sure to stray from the norm and order the won-ton egg noodle soup with shrimp balls and char siu . this was seriously the best single thing that i have eaten in the last year , since moving here from the land of asian soups , china town , honolulu . everything was cooked to perfection , and the percentage of noodle to won ton , and the beautiful broth was a flavor combination that in my mind is the king bowl of soup in az , asian or not ! thats all i really have to say . next time you find yourself near mekong market in mesa , if you want to change your week for the better , go in and order a bowl !		5		1
mostly agree with the other poster . it 's not so much a sketchy part of town as it is just plain old central phx . it 's the west side , but not the wessyde ! if you know what i mean . the best pho in town , hands down . pho is a vietnamese specialty - a noodle soup that comes with a large plate of fresh herbs that are torn up and put in the soup . the rice paper wrapped spring rolls and thin crispy egg rolls are great . the decor is plain but the food is fresh , inexpensive , and outstanding . do n't even bother with the chinese dishes - they 're plain and not the focus of the place , unless you 're going to order chinese broccoli in which case go ahead . the soups are delicious . great broth , either pork with egg noodle or beef with rice noodle . the duck soup is also superb . better than a lot of pho joints i 've been to in socal , and that 's saying a lot ! it 's family owned and run , they are very nice hardworking people , and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome . some of the beverages are great - pennyworth , young coconut , and of course the french press coffee with condensed milk , a viet staple . look on the menu for # 72 or # 78 , forget which , which is ground beef wrapped in grape leaf and grilled - it comes with a plate of herbs , rice noodle with sauce and peanut , some dipping sauce , and dry flat rice noodle type disks that you dip in hot water , put in your hand , and assemble the beef , herbs , rice noodle , etc , inside of .		5		1
like indian food ? like veggie ? i 've got a place for you ! if you 're one of the v people , you know that finding a good place for your eating preferences is not always easy . sometimes you 'll look through a menu dominated by meat dishes for one or two items that are all starch and grease . at udupi , you have an all-vegetarian menu with a ton of vegan options . delicious . if you order something with batura , you 're going to get a massive poof of bread brought to your table with your entree that will definitely leave you with leftovers . want another kind of bread ? that 's a naan issue -- they have many different flavors and varieties of naan to choose from . take your pick . at some point in the past , a number of yelp reviewers made complaints about the cleanliness of this place . those days are apparently quite long gone . everything was clean as a whistle and service with fast and smiling . you even get a special copy of the coffee news with your meal . this is another spot to put on your list of `` must go '' vegetarian joints in the valley . i 'm pretty sure you 're going to enjoy it .		5		1
i love me my juan 's ! i debated between 4 and 5 stars . i decided on 5 , and i will tell you why ! food gets the 5 stars - a rating for `` old school mexican food '' ; not for elements or kai . in the genre of budget-priced mexican food , it 's a 5 star . the food is soooo good ! it is that old school sonoran style type of mexican i remember from when i was a kid in phoenix -lrb- 60 's -70 's -rrb- . it is simple , generous servings but not monstrously so . the staff are long-term , get to know you types . they work hard , and are very easy going when it comes to just about anything ; even when you pay , they 'll take your group 's bill and allow you to pay one at a time , so no dealing with a split check a the table . this is good for groups going out for lunch from work . in the early 90 's there original location was on 16th st - tiny ... and they were renown for their burros . they are still a mainstay today and if you are n't certain of what to order , get a burrito . their tortas are also exceptional . i am partial to the basic combo plates . the drawbacks : and yes , there are some - time . i would go more often , but the amount of time you will wait can be very inconsistent . even when we arrive early -lrb- for lunch -rrb- , there can be delays . i should n't be gone for more than an hour for lunch , and have been 90 minutes twice when out at juan 's . for me , this is a problem . and even though i really like the wait-staff , i think that there are some organizational issues that cause the hold-ups . maybe understaffed ? i do n't know for sure , but it 's worth mentioning . chips . i like the chips and hot sauce , but do n't love them . they are the old school variety , which are ok but i do like me some really hot out of the fryer chips served with cold chunky salsa , and that 's not what you 'll get here . you will get the smooth red hot sauce and usually tepid thicker chips . if you have n't tried juan 's , and you do n't have an inflexible schedule , definitely give them a try . order an old favorite , and see if you like how they prepare it .		5		1
could have sworn we wrote a review for the rokerij a long time ago ... this is one of our favorites and a place we have been back to many times . have met lots of friends here and they end up loving it and bring other friends . our favorite thing to do is go for happy hour and smaple a bunch of the apps . have had a full dinner a few times and have comepletly enjoyed every meal . i do n't think we have had better seafood anywhere else in phx . still want to try the monstrous ribeye they offer . we usually head down into the cellar -lrb- where we promptly lose cell phone service . . if you are expecting a call , good luck ! -rrb- . upstairs is very nice , but the real people watching is downstairs . downstairs gets very busy . the only thing we have not done yet at the rokerij is the late night happy hour ... maybe this week !		5		1
i ate dinner at the bar and had a great time . i ordered the stuffed shrimp , a caesar salad , and a half order of sea bass . the food was really good the only thing i did n't care for was the salad . the dressing was awesome but there was n't enough for the whole salad . on top of that they serve the lettuce whole so you have to cut it yourself . i 'd rather not work to eat my food . the shrimp had a kick to it but that 's expected since it 's stuffed with horseradish mashed potatoes . my sea bass was delicious and the half portion was perfect after eating an appetizer and salad . the bartender was very friendly and i was very happy with his service . it seemed like there were a lot of regulars sitting at the bar and they were very friendly . i 've seen some pretty harsh reviews on here . i do n't see how anybody ca n't enjoy a meal here . the food is that good .		5		1
someone should have told me about this happy hour ! this really is the best value for happy hour that i have ever seen . you get food off their regular fantastic menu at a discounted price and they do n't skimp and give you tiny portions like many places do for happy hour . i shared the `` big ass burger '' and the green chili pork and they were both really good . the burger really is huge but really good and comes with fries . the green chili was good spicy and flavorful and i want to go back for more ! drinks , they have about 5 signature drinks for happy hour that are $ 5 and a few wines as well . great value . the guava mojito was amazing and i could have had several ! the margarita was a dissappointment , too much sour mix . stick with the mojitos ! they are great . this really did n't feel like happy hour with the full meal we had at such a great price for such a nice restaurant . service was good and not pushy or trying to rush you at all which is a nice change ! i will be back very soon !		5		1
boooooossssaaaaaaaaa donuts . bosa donuts ... this place is so good . i do n't know how it 's possible but , even late at night , when i inevitably decide i need donuts , the selections here are still fresh and tasty ! i love the regular glazed , blueberry cake and lemon-filled the best ... closely followed by all the others ! drive-thru is 24 hours and the dining area is open until 10:30 pm . also , the lady behind the counter is always so nice ... makes the visit even more enjoyable . do n't forget to grab a milk outta their cooler ... goes perfect with your sweet ! and now that i 've read other yelpers reviews , i have to try their savory selections and croissants too ! i 'll definitely be back ... soon ! see ya there !		5		1
this is a place i miss terribly ever since i moved away . i go at least three times during my week-long vacays back to scottsdale , and i always order the exact same thing : pablo picasso salad , hold the cilantro , and a pizzookie -lrb- chocolate chip , of course -rrb- . i 've tried the pizza , the sandwiches , all of the apps , but these are the only two things that have me coming back . the dressing on the picasso salad tastes like a delicious mexican party in your mouth , and the salad itself has so many wonderful ingredients , including a very delicious , slightly spicy fajita chicken . there are four different kinds of cheeses in here , and tomatoes , and chips . i. love . this . salad . however , i love pretty much nothing more in this universe -lrb- sorry , bf ! -rrb- than the amazingness that is the pizzookie . i often dream about it , and wish i could replicate it in my own kitchen . even other restaurants fail at making this dish perfect -lrb- i 'm looking at you , bj 's and boulders ! -rrb- . oregano 's excels and makes you want to eat this every day . i can never finish a whole one -lrb- and when i do , i feel sick but in the most satisfying way -rrb- , so i usually share . i get pretty greedy and territorial , though , so watch out . the service here is always very friendly and nice , and many of the male servers are very attractive -lrb- that 's a nice bonus ! -rrb- . prices are definitely on the cheaper side , and they have some new-ish options of making your salad a ` junior ' size for a few bucks less , and it 's still a ton of food . bottom line , you have to try the pizzookie . you may hate me later for the weight i made you gain from becoming addicted , but during those orgasmic moments when the warm , melty cookie is in your mouth , you 'll be thanking me .		5		1
everyone knows the spa is great , but what about the pool ? i 'm a bit biased because i do n't technically have to crash this pool , i have a key . my family has a home right next to the resort , so i 've had the ability to use their pool since i was born . personally , i think it 's worth it to spring for a spa treatment while your there and take advantage of the adults only pool . otherwise , the pools are not much to look at . the jackrabbit pool attracts more kids and poolside service ends at 8pm -lrb- sometimes 4pm in the summer -rrb- , but i believe the pool itself is open 24 hours . the other pool , the garden pool , usually has less kids and also has poolside service . basically , this is a valley establishment and that is why i like it . there are probably more exciting pools to crash , but this is an old standby . also , it is currently undergoing renovations . update : i guess you do n't need a key anymore - so , feel free to walk in like you own the place : -rrb-		5		1
have a hankering to eat meat from sticks and do n't want to visit the county fair ? thai rama is your place . of course i am speaking of the chicken satay . very good with some peanut sauce . i have n't had a whole lot of exposure to thai restaurants but the few times i have been here , i have n't been disappointed . the menu offers many interesting dishes including a soup served in a flaming bundt cake pan -lrb- ok so it is n't actually a bundt cake pan , but i like to imagine it is -rrb- . the soup is absolutely delicious , just do n't eat the wood floating in it . for seasoning only . you can eat it if you want , just do n't come crying to me when you have a mouth full of splinters . i tried a coconut curry stew with chicken and potatoes . i could n't stop eating it even after i was full . an incredible dish available in varying degrees of spiciness . might i also suggest you try an iced coffee ? i 'd have it with or for dessert though . it 's so sweet and strong and good that i swore i could almost see through walls when i finished it . the staff is very friendly and attentive and i would recommend thai rama to anyone . even you ... i guess .		5		1
had the best wine tasting experince in my life . -lrb- and i 've had quite a few -rrb- . this was experienced in their swanky bar area , in a sexy booth . oscar , you were beyond your beck and call . seriously , you were amazing , informative , helpful , professional , the whole package deal . your service was impecable . so , we had about 12 wines to choose from , 1/2 from napa , 1/2 from south africa . and we are not talking 1oz pours here , they were given in beautiful , large crystal goblets . -lrb- i so hate little wine glass which sell for 25 cents -rrb- . -lrb- and yes , we had them all : -- rrb - these were free poured , let me tell you ! and they gave a great little booklet of the wine , year , description to keep and log your tasting notes . hubby and i played hookie on this beautful thursday afternoon , and it was divine . i sure hope they have this even again , cuz i am so there . oh , i guess i should mention we did have some food - haha - the crispy roasted half chicky was yum , and so were the truffle fries - omg .		5		1
this is sprawling , brand new `` campus '' located right in downtown mesa . performing arts stages , galleries , classes , restaurants ... this city-run campus is a really , really nice venue to do anything . my architect friend said the campus was a little ... over the top ... there are lot of things going on , and it is a little overwhelming . but not a disjointing experience . every month they do their sound in the ground events , which are aimed at younger , hipper crowds . they feature music that relates to the new , featured exhibit . for example , february 's theme was salsa to coincide with an exhibition of la loteria -lrb- which was amazing -rrb- , and they had latin/retro/surfer rock band perform , and margaritas on special at their cash bar . the hold the events in this beautiful below ground courtyard with plenty of tables and chairs , or you can sit right on the graduated concrete step in front of the travertine flowing waterwall . you really have to see it to appreciate it . be sure to check out sound in the ground before it gets to hot to hang out and listen to music outside !		5		1
ok , so i had written a review of our yelp birthday party , but not of the museum itself . just got back from the `` selected shorts '' exhibit : short films . after having lunch in arcadia farms , a group of 12 of us headed to the film festival -lrb- no festival required -rrb- . seven shorts , all very different . and the exhibit was free !!! we did n't even have to pay to get into the museum , since we were having lunch . entering the theater was really cool ! stadium seating , which i had n't expected . when you 're a shorty like me , stadium seating is a must unless you want to deal with a crink in yer neck . there was a stage with the screen above it , so even the people in front would have a good view without said crink . no popcorn , but the seats were comfy . staff was really friendly and it started and ended when they said it would ! * gasp * definitely going to be back to the museum and most definitely going to catch screenings in the theater .		5		1
went to cafe bink for lunch on saturday , and it was one of the best lunches i have had in a long time ! we had a bottle of chanpagne and a sandwich each . my friend had the white cheddar grilled cheese and i had the corned beef sandwich . his grilled cheese was full of flavor and i can not tell you how great my corned beef was ... we also had the french fries which have to be the best french fries i have ever had ! they are cooked 3 times before arriving at your table and served with three dipping sauces . with our lunch we split a bottle of baumard which was perfect with both sandwiches . also , the service was great . highly recommend cafe bink !		5		1
i wish this place were more popular ! just got back from enjoying a late-ish bite here on a saturday night , and it was deserted . too bad ! my posse and i appreciated the music - some pretty random sirius station played at a dominating but not overly loud volume . i tried a new menu item , the chili , and was blown away . fantastic . i could n't decide if i liked the hearty chunks of steak , or the strips of turkey better . the beans and veggies were good , and the overall flavor was not too spicy or over-the-top , which is how i like it . a cup is a smoking deal at under three dollars . i tried the pepperoni , and as boring as it sounds , i think i have a new fave here . the flavors balance perfectly - tomato sauce , mozzarella , and the sausage itself , plus the amazing burnt crust . i noticed today for the first time that the crust includes a sourdough flavor - subtle , but it 's there . mmmmhmm . we finished the night out with a pizza cookie . solid , but i wo n't remember it later as particularly stand-out . i look forward to the revised dessert menu coming hopefully soon to see what varieties of pizza cookie they offer and what else they 're going to add back . allow me to note -lrb- again -rrb- their terrific happy hour : 3 to 6 , every day ! if anyone is ever in the area and looking to hit it up for hh , shoot me a text !		5		1
just got home from an evening with close friends at nobuo 's ... been wanting to go for awhile now because i am a big fan of asian fusion cooking . . especially japanese fusion . really , really good food and presented beautifully ! since there were four of us we shared the tasting menu -lrb- x2 -rrb- and some items off of the menu ... tasting menu featured a japanese antipasti -lrb- pickled daikon , snap peas in miso and house made kimchi -rrb- , asian spoons with kumamoto 's and uni and house cured salmon , himachi with avacado , grapefruit and truffle oil , braised oxtails and a dessert plate . all the flavors were fresh , blended well and left your palate excited and refreshed . artfully presented on really cool china ... highly recommend the tasting menu !! we also ordered the 25min poached egg with asparagus -lrb- awsomely silky texture , cooked sous vide style -rrb- , octopus fritters , pork belly buns , and the teeter tots ... all was great ! lovely food in a lovely atmosphere ! the service was very good also ! -lrb- thanks greg ! -rrb-		5		1
it 's an interesting mix of opinions posted about chino bandito . frankly on my first visit i was n't sure what to think . on my next visit i was hooked . whenever i find myself near the 17 and greenway i 'm thinking about stopping by for eat-in or take-out . chino bandido is definitely a funky place as everyone says . it 's in a not so fancy strip mall with not so fancy decor inside . but look past it and you 'll have some fun . even though it 's kind of funky i did find it to be clean - and i 'm extremely finicky about cleanliness . some of the menu winners include the # 13 pollo diablo , which delights with garlic and hot peppers . besides that the # 10 emerald chicken has a wonderful flavoring including ginger that is well-teamed with the jerk fried rice . enjoy the hot sauce and interesting mix of flavors . i also like the chocolate volcano which is only available on certain days . yes it is an odd mix of mexican , chinese and caribbean flavors , but it works . chino bandito is very inexpensive and highly recommended . just keep an open mind .		5		1
it 's true ! after several failed attempts to eat at butterfield 's due to the long wait time , i can finally say that i 've finally had the chance to actually eat here . so what did i think ? it was most definitely worth the wait ! there 's a reason butterfield 's has a two hour wait on the weekends . it 's because this is n't your average breakfast . they do n't just have basic omelets and pancakes on the menu . no , they have succulent skillets filled with cheese , hashbrowns , eggs and toppings galore . they have buttermilk pancakes with different flavors such as oreo cookie pancakes . they have bacon belgian waffles . they have oven baked pancakes ! the menu is large and in charge and this breakfast definitely leaves you full for the rest of the day ! during my first official visit here , i ate my heart out . i ordered the santa fe scrambler which comes with eggs -lrb- i opted for egg whites -rrb- , chorizo sausage , red jalapeño pepper , onion & cheddar cheese . all this sits atop freshly made crispy hashbrowns . as if that 's not enough , the scrambler comes with your choice of pancakes or toast . of course i ordered the homemade buttermilk pancakes ! the feast arrived relatively quickly and it was absolutely a feast ! there was no way i could finish the meal , but every bite i took was better then the next . the hashbrowns were the perfect amount of crispy and the chorizo had a nice kick to it . the avocado and peppers blended in quite nicely and there was plenty of cheese to go around ! i doused my buttermilk pancakes with butterfield 's homemade syrup and wow , they know how to make a carbtastic pancake ! i wish i could have consumed every last bite , but i ate until i was full and left happily full ! i 'm so happy that i 've finally had the chance to eat at butterfield 's . now that i know how delicious the food is , the wait time wo n't seem so bad anymore .		5		1
literally ... so many times i have thought ` should i drive all the way to chandler to eat this ? ' i found this place while playing third wheel to my best friend , meg , and her boyfriend , adam . we wanted chinese food so i got to searching for something cheap near their house . adam chimes in mocking yelp ` how many spoons does it have , sam ?! if it only has a 3 spoon rating we 're not going ! ' we arrived to see this tiny , upbeat asian man rocking the house . he seriously holds the fort down and he is funny . and adorable . we took our food to-go and started tasting all of the treats we brought home . holy smokes this food was the business . we got the noodles with the chicken as well as the chicken with the mushrooms . the old guy recommended both . i was expecting mediocre food considering the price and the hole in the wall-ness of it . but this is sooooooo goooooooddddd . i 'm pretty sure it 's horrible for you so thankfully it 's pretty far from me . but anytime i 'm over there , we eat here . make fun of yelp again , adam ! you 're going to start worshiping the yelp gods -lrb- and me ! -rrb- for finding you this delicacy .		5		1
i just simply love southwest airlines . a -rrb- the crew . i have never been on a southwest flight where the crew was n't positive and smiling -lrb- ever flown delta ? complete opposite -rrb- . b -rrb- the onboard snacks . they will give you as many as you want ! and they 're decent snacks ! c -rrb- no baggage fees . quite possibly the most desireable aspect of an airline -lrb- besides quality planes of course -rrb- . i had 2 giant checked bags and the no-fee came in super handy for that . the only thing i 'm still torn on is the free for all boarding . i have to make sure to call 24 hrs prior to boarding to get an a section boarding , and then i 'm always nervous that the late-comers will be a gigantic , spill into my seat passenger or a couple with a mess of screaming babies . i jest ... . southwest is by far the best airline out there !!!!!		5		1
since you probably do n't know what to expect ... here 's what to expect : vibes : the owners are exceptionally sweet and friendly -lrb- as in , free lemonade and halva cake ?! what the deuce ! -rrb- there 's no strong overwhelming arab or israeli influence , just a perfect , little mecca of all things authentically middle eastern , from labneh to imported pareve chocolate spread . location : a funky fresh exterior covered in graphic art , like world peace signs , baklava , camels and snakes ... and generally sparse parking . food : a surprisingly diverse and wonderful selection of food to please the meatless palate . we ordered the vegetarian sampler , which is a solid one-person sized lunch consisting of a pita , four falafel , a spinach pie , four little dolmas , baba ganoush , hummus , tabbouleh , and tzatziki . the falafelim were better than the ones i had in jerusalem . so blasphemous ... yet so crispy . other : they have sheep 's milk cheese . that is a big deal . also , their iced tea and lemonade are both delicious , meaning the potential for the perfect arnold palmer is right at your fingertips . in a word : unique . this is the most accommodating , authentic , friendly , and , dare i say , seemingly neutral middle eastern restaurant and market i have yet to encounter . if you 're not convinced of mebad 's worthiness by now ... dir balak . now go eat ! b ` tayavon !		5		1
digestif is the masterwork of valley restaurateur peter kasperski -lrb- cowboy ciao , kaz bar -rrb- , which he describes as farm-to-table rustic napa-italian with up-to-the-minute ingredients in a gorgeous brick basement setting . the mood is casual , loud-ish , and jovial . there is a wide age-range represented and there appeared to be celebrations from girls-night-out to date-night to family dinner . the overhead speakers set the mood -lrb- particularly for me -rrb- with indie music and the servers rock tees from their favorite bands . the service here is impeccable , as the waiters seem to share responsibilities of each table , led by a main server who takes your order and makes sure everything 's tip-top . pretty cool concept , i think . my gf and i started with a bottle of the chariot sangiovese -lrb- $ 27 -rrb- , which was probably the second best bottle of wine i 've ever had in a restaurant -lrb- behind the 2005 escorihuela gascon malbec shared with jason c and graham c in a buenos aires steakhouse , but i digress -rrb- . this was a magical compliment to our starter of the meatball/parma/stewed onion bruschettone -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- , which had such a surprisingly fantastic flavor , i actually smirked to myself in shock . next came the mixed greens salad -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- , which was an average salad with a red-wine vinaigrette along with a bacon & pinto soup in beef stock with a garlic baguette soaking inside . blown . the fuck . away . its fairly hearty for a starter , but i could n't stop scooping it up until the last slurp nonetheless . for our entrees , my gf order the seared sea scollops -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- , which came with 3 giant scallops with roasted and pureed cauliflower , pine nuts , raisins , and some other fancy things i did n't determine . she indicated that she loved her dish , and this coming from a master-scallop-binger . i tasted it ... twice it was so good ... and she was right . the scallops were perfectly seared and very fresh . i had the penne pasta -lrb- made fresh daily -rrb- with lamb meatballs -lrb- $ 17 -rrb- . amazing dish , especially for a lamb partisan , like myself . the portions were ` just right ' , so that we could sample quite a few things off their menu and not feel obscenely full . good thing , because that olive oil cake was staring me right in the face , daring me . and yet again , another amazing treat from pastry chef tracy dempsey -lrb- of cowboy ciao -rrb- . this was presented like a pound cake with a denser quality , warm berry black pepper sauce , roseberry sorbetto , and rose sabayon . now that put us over the top . we were absolutely satiated at this point , so much so , we did n't even get a chance to try a digestif -- and they have quite an impressive selection , -lrb- even gammel dansk , which i had n't seen in 12 years since i lived in denmark -- i did n't even know they imported it in the us ! -rrb- so , you would expect this dinner to come out to some outrageous sum , residing in its moddish space in the epicenter of high-crust scottsdale society in the most posh development on a saturday night at dinnertime , right ? nope . total , including a bottle of wine , an appetizer , soup , salad , two entrees , and dessert was just slightly above a hundo . i will be highly recommending this place to friends and visitors , particularly because the night does n't have to end once you leave this fantastic restaurant , as it is in the heart of the valley 's most walkable entertainment district .		5		1
found this place next door to my favorite coffee joint ; copper star . i walked in not really expecting much , but sometimes love is like belly button lint ... it just shows up out of nowhere ; unexpected ; and i fell in love with revolver records . i love vinyl and this place has an amazing selection as well as fair prices and an overall hip atmosphere . a dylan record played when i walked in and after that donovan setting the perfect mood as i shopped through all the records i could ever hope to shop through , looked over t-shirts -lrb- unexpectedly , genuinely hip compared to those i have seen in what i origionally thought to be similar stores in the past -rrb- , and picked out a few buttons to make myself feel in full force awesomeness like i was in high school . i also picked out an independantly produced dvd of some local bands that i am excited to check out . all in all this is my happy place . damn the man . save the empire .		5		1
pizzeria bianco is widely acknowledged as some of the best pizza -lrb- or the best to some reivewers -rrb- in the nation . not sure what i can add except to say it was terrific ! the princess and i went to his second location in the town and country shopping center -lrb- biltmore area -rrb- and walked right in at 5 pm . the location is wonderful , setting is nice looking out onto the courtyard and it appears there are tables you can use if the weather is not 110 as it was during our visit . we ordered a nice italian red wine for the p and i had a negroni , both were fantastic . the meal started with a small complimentary bowl of five small kalmata olives and a few slices of their in-house bread with a bowl of olive oil , nice touch . i ordered their famous wise guy and the p ordered the sonny boy . the wise guy is white sauced based with wonderful fennel sausage from shrieners -lrb- local meat co. -rrb- fennel , roasted onions . wood fired , the pizza was excellent . however , i actually enjoyed the sonny boy more . it was red sauce based with soppresseta and it was , imho , one of the best pizzas i 've ever had . we finished the meal with flourless chocolate cake , very good with a vanilla sauce . service was delightful , server was attentive without being in our face . loved the small touches such as real silverware -lrb- oneida -rrb- . attention to detail has made mr. bianco a success and i 'm humbled to be able to join the chorus of people who sing his and his restaurants praises ! slainte !		5		1
tomorrow i walk for my diploma and let me say ... this place got me through the late nights in architecture school . of course i changed majors , but when ron and i had to stay up till 5am working on models and drawing this place was a lifesaver . while they have a pricey menu , you have to take in account their outsourcing wieners ! i would say to eat what you get there , and do n't chance the meal getting cold before you get to your destination . plus the restaurant in itself is great ! on the walls there are funny little comics and newspaper clippings that give this place its true character . this place definitely needs more than 10 reviews . try this place asap cause you 'll be sorry if you do n't . then you too can be a witness to the deliciousness		5		1
`` but i do n't even like hotdogs ! '' i proclaimed as i devoured half of my bfs beer hot oliver style . that is what i thought until i had my first taste of short leash dogs at the downtown phx market a few sundays ago . i was shocked at how much i loved it ! the bread ! it 's so soft and compliments the dog and toppings perfectly . the dog , the endless variety of toppings ! so awesome , i ca n't imagine better street food , and i ca n't wait to try the one with cream cheese and fried pickles . in fact , i am planing my next visit as i type this , reminded of how instead of stealing my bfs - i have to have one of my very own asap .		5		1
d'lish is amazing on all levels : food , service , convenience ... they just have it all . i go here for a quick breakfast and they definitely have some healthful -lrb- and flavorful -rrb- options . the california club is my favorite ... turkey , avocado , bacon , 2 eggs , pesto and light cream cheese on a fresh ciabatta bun . it 's the perfect size for breakfast and hits all the right spots . my other fav . is the quinoa `` oatmeal '' . though a bit on the pricey side -lrb- $ 4.50 + tax -rrb- for this cup-o-d'liciousness , i far prefer it over standard , mushy oatmeal . they top it with steamed milk , fresh fruit and granola , making it the perfect hot cereal . add great coffee to the equation , and we have a winner . i also have to comment on the service . these guys definitely work hard when it 's busy , but at the same time are always friendly and inviting . great service goes a long way with me , and that 's probably what earned them 5 stars in my book .		5		1
i had no idea this park existed until a few weeks ago but it is the cutest park in town . even though i 'm not a 4-year old boy i really like trains . and even though i do n't have a kid to bring with me , the boyfriend and i still had a great time . overall the park is set up for kids . it would be an amazing place to have a kid 's birthday party . you can rent out one of the trains and have your party in there - how cool would that be ? there are four min attractions that cost money - the regular -lrb- well , not full sized -rrb- train , the carousel , the museum and the little steamer train . nothing is more than $ 2/person but we bought a book of tickets that gets you into everything for $ 10 . that 's $ 10 for both of us ! first we went on the `` big '' train . it 's a scaled down version of a regular steam engine train . it goes all around the park and is a fairly long ride . super fun . next we went into the museum . they have a room with some artifacts and then you get to go inside the cars of a train to see the kitchen , a dining room , a couple sleeping cars and a lounge . then we hit the carousel - standard but still fun . although i think we were the only adults riding it - ha ! but we saved the best for last - the little steamers . it 's a miniature train but it can carry passengers . -lrb- even adults ! -rrb- everything on the route is mini too and there are funny signs along the way . the park itself is so pretty - lots of huge shade trees and nice grassy areas to play or relax on and it 's very clean . i was very impressed at how nice it was . so even if you do n't have kids , this place is a fun and different way to spend an afternoon . it made for a perfect sunday activity . all aboard , i say !		5		1
to review or not to review , that 's the question i 've been struggling with . with 50 reviews already , what more could little ol' me possibly add ? absolutely nothing , i knew . but then , today turned out to be a special day ... i was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch . fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back . where was she going ? pasty !!! she just needed to know what i wanted , of course . so i checked the pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - i mean the wall of my cube , and to my surprise discovered that this was n't going to be just another pasty ... being the quasi-vegetarian i am , i 've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu -lrb- more than 10 delicious options , including my favorite eggplant parmesan -rrb- , and there was only one left - the veggie tikka masala . my 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion , do n't you think ? it was while i was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken , bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust , dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that i realized , 50 reviews be damned . something new to say or not , i 've got to say it . so for what 's it 's worth , this is it . so , in conclusion : if you have n't been to pasty yet , you need to go - soon . come on , man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating ? this place so obviously rocks ! one tip : if you go for lunch , go early -lrb- they open at 11 -rrb- . it gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets . going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more -lrb- otherwise you 'll be sittin ' at separate tables , or at the bar - oh , and should you find yourself headed for the bar , try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens , as those seats get pretty freakin ' warm -rrb- .		5		1
omg they have the best dolmades i have ever had . i 've searched high and low for them , including multiple greek restaurants and the greekfest . still no one can beat pj 's dolmades . i am also in love with the roasted bell pepper hummus . i went there for take-out yesterday . the dolmades were almost finished by the time i got home . i skipped the pitas that came with the hummus and instead brought out my own veggies , all of which went great with the dip . i want the recipe !! the restaurant itself is such a pleasant place to be , too . the inside is huge with high ceilings and lots of windows , and the patio is always hoppin ' . this was the second time i went and i have yet to eat a mediocre item there .		5		1
the thought of ever sitting in a sticky , stinky , over filled harkins again makes me want to cry . ipic has ruined all other theaters for me . first off , these seats are huge . sorry fly boys , that yawn move is n't going to work here . copping a feel would be serious work . and to the 10 year old in every r rated movie i go to way past their bed times , your parent 's poor decisions wont effect me tonight . unless your wearing stilts no way are you kicking the back of my seat . over priced soda . no thanks , i 'll take a glass of wine , or the complimentary sodas they offer . stale popcorn , uh none for me thanks , fresh popped and free ! but save room for the extensive menu they offer . was it pricey ? yes . is it worth it ? absolutely . oh , and there 's a soft fluffly blanket sitting on the seat for each guest . nice touch , ipic , very nice touch .		5		1
an absolutely impeccable 5-star evening with the husband celebrating valentine 's day a day late . it has been a while since i 've enjoyed a true 5-star evening and our dinner at the house was pure heaven . our server , karen , was an absolute pro . she made great suggestions , had intimate knowledge of the menu and the specials , she was interesting but not intrusive , and she was everything i want in a server . we sat outside in the garden and it was just lovely although as the evening stretched on , it did get a bit chilly despite the heat lamps and sitting next to the fireplace . the garden is beautiful though and even though the restaurant is right off of baseline rd. you do n't hear the noise of the road at all . now on to the food . oh my . the food . we enjoyed the cheese board and the fried arancini with tomato sauce which are fried risotto balls to start . we chose white cheddar , parmesan , and brie and it was wonderful accompanied with dried cherries , golden raisins and the candied figs were to die for over grilled toast points . the fried arancini was awesome . toasty and crunchy on the outside , but creamy and cheesy on the inside . our second course included the cauliflower soup and field green salad . the soup has a hint of serrano pepper to it which added a nice heat on the back of the throat . i had the mango and serrano mojito which really paired nicely with it . the field green salad had a delicious lemony dressing that really made the salad pop . my husband had the rib eye and i had the shrimp and grits for our main dishes . my husband prefers his steak well done and the house did not disappoint . the steak was well done but still juicy and delicious inside . the shrimp and grits were perfect . the shrimp was perfectly seasoned and just right in doneness . the grits were creamy and not grainy at all . the bacon and carrots in the grits added just the right amount of salty crunch that really made this a well rounded dish . for dessert , i had the cannolis . what made it that much more special was the strawberries that were garnishing the plate had the cannoli filling piped on top . o.m.g. . that should have been the dessert in and of themselves ! every facet of our dinner at the house at secret garden was just right . i can not wait to go back and i sure hope karen will be our server ! i will say this though ... do not plan to rush through this meal . this meal is meant to be savored , relished , and enjoyed . our reservation was at 6:30 and we did n't get out of there until 9:15 and we enjoyed every single second of our meal . if you are in a big rush , do n't come to the house because you will not get out of it what you are truly meant to get out of being there . it is a gastronomic experience , not some fast-food bing , bang , boom b.s. take your time , sit back , and truly enjoy the experience .		5		1
wonderful fit for mill ave considering there was no other breakfast option . tables were close together and could be easily pushed together in the event you have an encounter -lrb- get it ! -rrb- with a stranger and want to become better acquainted . the restaurant was well staffed with friendly people striking up conversations and answering questions . plus the food was terrific . -lrb- it reminded me a lot of local breeze : fresh , local , healthy . -rrb- the coffee is local and comes from press coffee . delicious and it comes with free refills . they also had a large assortment of baked goods and i 'm pretty sure i saw someone with a mimosa . i welcome ncounter to mill ave and wish them nothing but the best .		5		1
http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ikeanearyouview?storeid=12&catalogid=11001&langid=-1&storename=localfood i love the ikea restaurant . i love the meatballs and the gravy and the lingonberry sauce and the lingonberry drink and their coffee , both regular and decaf . i love their salmon and their shrimp and their pastries and their dill sauce and their little red potatoes and just everything ! i 've never had anything there that is n't delicious ! and i love that i can afford it all and even sometimes get two entrees so i can taste both if i have n't been there for awhile . and i love that not only is it all delicious there but it is all available to buy packaged and/or frozen to take home and enjoy even more ! i love the ikea cafeteria . sample menu : deluxe breakfast plate scrambled eggs , bacon , swedish pancakes with lingonberries , potatoes , and coffee . $ 1.99 open-face shrimp sandwich served open faced on wheat with cold-water shrimp , hard boiled egg , and mayonnaise . $ 2.49 famous swedish meatball plate for only $ 4.99 15 swedish meatballs with potatoes and sweet-tart lingonberries . big swede breakfast plate available for only $ 2.99 : scrambled eggs , bacon , swedish pancakes with lingonberries , potatoes , french toast sticks , sausage patty , and coffee .		5		1
i have never had a bad meal at ticoz . i go often and i love food ! the service is terrific ... very relaxed atmosphere but the food always rocks and the staff top notch . i 've had many things off the menu-but my favorite is the burgers . # 3 is to die for ! it has a lime mayo that makes it quite tasty . the criss cut spicy fries are a great accompaniment and i usually take the oriental coleslaw home for people to fight over ! i also got to see alison du bois eating lunch here , too ! the pineapple salsa is good but the chips are only so-so . but hey , that 's the worst thing and that 's ok with me ! ** update 08/14/09 : went for lunch and it was as good as ever ! we had an awesome server , pablo . he was very attentive and enhanced our meal ! he 's a terrific addition . in fact , the whole staff today seemed very , very efficient and good !		5		1
i 've been here 3 times now , and each time , i fall in love with this place a little more . today i had a slice of the bbq chicken pizza for the first time . wow . i 've had bbq chicken pizza one other time , many moons ago , and the taste almost sent me to the bathroom . but this ? this right here ? oh my . sweet and savory and spicy all at once . and of course i love their crust with the bit of garlic at the end . it really made my day . i also had the napoli for the second time . i think this might be my favorite ... wait no , the casablanca is my favorite ... no , the bbq chicken ... doh ! seriously , i 've never had this type of pizza , meaning thin crust gourmet . i 'm used to the big , pan crust pizza pies . this is a treat , though it will not replace my love for pies . it will be a new love affair . last thing , i 'm continually impressed with the freshness of their ingredients . i 've never had tomatos so sweet or mushrooms that i would eat by themselves . awesome stuff .		5		1
i do n't need to say anything other than grilled veggie lavosh wrap . jaw ... drop ... floor . and the spicy garlic potatoes ... can i please steal your recipe so i can make those every day of the week ? i 'm always amazed by pj . this location has `` the lake '' which has an amazing view and pj has wonderfully outfitted their patio so you can sit outside for all of the seasons . they have several heaters outside , plants , flowers - just beautiful . the inside has dark wood tables , a giant ornate mirror in the back and pictures/paintings on all of the walls . they had me by the first sentence but i also absolutely love their falafel platter , thousand bean pita - -lrb- de-lisious open faced pita -rrb- , and of course the hummus . their happy hour is seriously ridiculous ! hummus for a $ 1 ?! i know , i 'm getting carried away here but it 's true ! their food is fresh , bursting with flavor and priced for what you get . i never eat my whole meal and always take half of it home with me . and they even give you a to-go cup for your drinks -lrb- non-alcoholic that is -rrb- . this is a place i can go eat , not feel guilty , stuff myself and have a good time with friends and family .		5		1
i 've been meaning to go here for a long time . finally made it this week and i took along my little brother who is a keen aficionado of all that is new , hip , cool and whatever other term kids are saying now days . at 18 the world is his oyster and music is his thing . that said , stinkweeds was a big juicy slice of heaven . great for him , and extra `` cool big sister '' points for me . entry to the place is from the back - which gives a pleasantly different impression than the front . when we went it was a bit of a problem to get back there as the opening in the construction for `` business access '' had been blocked a bit more than it should have been . word to the wise - if you miss it , just park next door and walk on over . while you are walking , relish the fact that not too terribly long from now there will be a light rail stop across the street . my brother was quite excited by the prospect . entering stinkweeds i was immediately shocked by how small it was . really shocked . but then ya look around and realize they have almost an entire wall of listening stations . for a spot this small to invest in that is really a testament to how they value and know their customers . in the hour or so while we were there we saw several groups of people go right to them listen to several selections and then walk up to the register with their purchases . my brother and i meandered around the place . he went in alphabetical order , front to back . i went right for the paste station . stinkweeds in the only spot in phoenix with a paste station , and as i am a huge fan of paste magazine , i was really excited . -lrb- review within a review : paste is an awesome magazine about music , movies , pop culture , video games , books etc and in each edition they include a cd with new and cool music . the paste listening station allows you to hear more by the same artists that are covered in that month 's cd . and the cd 's always rock . stinkweeds also sells the magazines , including those cds , in the back . they even had some old editions which really helped me when looking for some cds . -rrb- i could n't find an artist i was looking for , went to the counter to ask about it and i was told how easy it was to get . she took down my name and number and said she 'd give me a call wednesday when it came in . presto . she was very nice . i left with 2 cd 's , and one on the way . my brother left with 4 - but he wanted even more . he was excited for some used spoon he found . used spoon . reminds me of an old korn joke . anyhow , i highly suggest the place . visit regularly , visit often . update : she called when the cd came in and left a message . i never returned her call because i got busy , or always forgot , or some other lame excuse . almost a week later i finally made it there . the cd was still behind the counter with my name on it . oh yea ...		5		1
how freaken awesome is this place !?!??! ladmo our shih tzu was in need of a bath . we usually tackle this task at home or take him to petsmart . our bathroom tub is draining slow -lrb- most likely due to washing him at home , and it was christmas eve , so there was no way of getting him a same day appointment at petsmart -rrb- enter wag n '' wash . . i remember seeing this place every time i would cruise the melrose district but never stopped in . boy am i so glad we went in ! it was crowded when we got there , we had to park about a block away and walk over . the store was packed , but we were greeted promptly . we told them it was our first time and we were here for a wash . they said it would be a bit of a wait , but no less then a minute went by and they called our name to go back to the washroom . we actually had fun washing our dog . we did the middle package -lrb- i think it was $ 15 , which included our choice of shampoo -lrb- we went with a whitening brightener since ladmo has a lot of white fur -rrb- , conditioner , leave in conditioner and doggie cologne ! one of the staff came over and gave us the run down . any time we had a question there was a staff member with in arms reach to ask . the blow drying also went reallllly well . usually at home , when we get to the blow drying part , ladmo losses his mind and turns into what closely resembles the tasmanian devil ... whipping about and biting us . at wag n wash he was calm , in fact i think he may have liked it . i will for sure give their grooming services a shot and see how that goes . the store itself has tons of great products for dogs and cats . our cats went nuts over the organic catnip toys ! ladmo loves the training treats from the bakery area . so thankful for a place like wag n ' wash !		5		1
today was my third visit to this pacific seafood buffet . they seemed to have it all together on october 28th , just four days after they first opened , but then eleven days later when i went back for a second visit , they were all disorganized with food not all out until way after opening , some items the wrong temperatures , & so on ! it was such a disappointment , & i cut them down to 4 stars in my update then , & they deserved worse . now , though , after a little over a month more , i 'm thrilled to report that they 've solved all the problems & everything was just terrific today ! to start with , this is the largest chinese buffet in arizona , based on the variety of food out . -lrb- the next largest is their other excellent location of the same name , over in chandler . -rrb- not only does pacific here in glendale have a lot of delicious things that i have never seen anywhere else at the hundreds of buffets in az , but they vary what they serve too !! to me , that 's just nothing short of amazing , & i can all but guarantee you will find food here that you 've never seen before anyplace else !! the flavors of each dish were tops too , everything was fixed just right , the temperatures were right , the service was great , the place is beautiful , & the prices reasonable . i say this one really has it all ! : -- rrb - -rrb- lunch buffet $ 8.38 / $ 7.54 sr. .		5		1
yay to another great yelp elite event folks ! after checking in , we got to do this activity that lindsey put together . what a great way to get to know your fellow yelpers as well as new yelpers ! it was so much fun trying to get bingo and getting to know my yelpers ! = -rrb- the food ! i tried to so many items but my favorite had to be the nachos and the mushrooms . the nachos were amazing ! i devoured that . lol . & the mushrooms had a kick to it at the end . as far as the drinks , the rum punch had to be the highlight of the night ! not only does it come in a mason jar for you but it tastes amazing ! i also got to try the apple martini as well as the merlot which was not too shabby . even though this was a bit of a drive for me it was well worth it to get to know my fellow yelpers , meet new yelpers and try out some amazing food and drinks ! thank you to lindsey and outback ! = -rrb-		5		1
we joined lifetime for the indoor and outdoor pools . yes , that equals year around pool access . and we seem to be remaining members because they have parents ' night out , which is four hours of babysitting on periodic saturday nights for a cool $ 15 . and there are also the kids camps when my daughter 's school has a holiday . we tried the swim lessons , but the instruction was lacking . as far as exercising there , my wife worked out there at one point and enjoyed the zumba class . now there 's even a zumba class for kids . and there 's the prospect that she will work out there again one day , but it looks doubtful as she keeps adding flamenco dance classes to her schedule . recently , she is up to three flamenco 's a week . i 'm about to get back into my work out routine . no , seriously , stop laughing . the cafe is great , and the spa looks really nice . the spa worked really well for me when i needed to pick up a last minute valentine 's gift , i mean , gift card . thanks , lt.		5		1
you 'll have to go to the blog for the full scoop - 27 courses is too many to capture here . with expectations tempered given the circumstances but certainly higher than with a traditional `` interview '' dinner my arrival at binkley 's was timely and finding the couple already present and waiting in the lobby we exchanged pleasantries before reservations were confirmed were quickly led through the spacious dining room to a table just out of view of the kitchen . with noise moderate and the front-of-house surprisingly smiley and professional yet whimsical and conversant from the moment we arrived i knew we would be in good hands -lrb- but little did i know how good . -rrb- seated at a comfortable four-top it would be mere moments after seating that our captain would greet us and after confirming water choices we were presented with a wine list and menus while the a la carte vs. 4/5/6 course tasting menu option was explained . with my co-diners having never experienced such a place and with many of the items on the menu rather novel to them we were left to decide and largely allowing them to dictate the pace we settled on the five course tasting ... or so we thought as what followed would actually be a twenty-seven `` course '' three hour and forty five minute rollercoaster ride through the imagination of chef binkley and his team . a few highlight dishes : brioche cinnamon doughnuts with bacon butter : piping hot and minimally greasy they were peerless , particularly when smeared with the umami-savory flavors of hickory smoked bacon . `` deep fried butter '' with lobster cream cheese and lobster roe powder , chef binkley 's take on lobster bisque created by dropping a butter cube into the fryer and subsequently injecting it with the cream cheese before dusting it with roe . sweet , creamy , intense and just like the sloppy joe a faithful recreation of the chef 's intention ... if this were served at the bar i 'd go and order a dozen . foie gras beignets with white truffle cream and foie gras vanilla milk shake with blackberry swirl and blackberry whipped cream . '' beginning first with the light balls of dough , each with a wispy crumb studded with whole cubes of duck liver torchon these bites were superlative on their own but even more so with the slightly sweet and ethereally aromatic cream . taking a bite and then moving to the shake ... yes , it was absolutely as good as it sounds - a smooth blend of blackberries and heavy cream with the gossamer of the liver always present yet slightly out of reach . entitled `` crispy seared foie gras with apple , raisins , pomegranate , spiced brazil nuts , popover , chervil '' and finished tableside with a spritz -lrb- literally from a spritzer -rrb- of cinnamon ice wine vinegar this preparation of duck liver would arrive as a linear stripe on a square plate and harkening the plating style of michael carlson the flavors would also compare favorably as the crackling exterior of the foie gave way to the melting interior and each bite lent itself to a new form of explanation with the accoutrements - most sweet , many smooth , and all interesting ; particularly the popover stuffed with a creamy puree of liver , nuts , and aromatic spices . for the next intermezzo all i can call it is a tease - a bit of dining refinement between novelty desserts that absolutely wowed - a two-bite peanut butter souffle with raspberry jam every bit as `` soufflé '' as the sloppy joe was its namesake and along with the foie gras beignet perhaps my favorite bites of a great meal . really - if this was offered on the menu i 'd have ordered a full sized one in a heartbeat . in the end binkley 's is a place that no matter where it was located would be special and a place that i 'll undoubtedly return to with frequency if my career path should indeed land me in the desert long term .		5		1
i just got married here and it was truly the most beautiful wedding i have ever been to . okay , i 'm a little bit biased , but sooo what !! honestly breathtaking , peaceful , serene . dianna at the park was a huge help ! i had access to the quaint little tea house to get dressed . my photographer got some beautiful photos in that house and all over the park - there are photo ops around every corner ! i also had access to a private little garden in the back so i was hidden from my guests before the ceremony began . my guests continue to gush how beautiful it was and how perfect the garden was for our wedding . i have had several guests tell me this is now their number one suggestion for family/friends looking for ceremony locations . the garden houses a large koi pond , 10-foot waterfall , grassy knolls , beautiful trees , bushes , flowers , tea house - all unique things that you would n't expect to see in or near downtown . things to note : the park offers fish food -lrb- for a cost -rrb- to feed the koi . the park offers brochures to give yourself or group a self-guided tour . the park offers tea ceremonies -lrb- for a cost -rrb- once a month . http://phoenixpd.org/parks/jfg.html		5		1
there 's nothing not to l-o-v-e about this place -lrb- well , maybe the bill but that 's out of the subject : -rrb- it has been hard for me to fall in love with a restaurant here in az , but city hall has never let me down . the shrimp cocktail is awesome . the size of the shrimp is kind of scary , i would n't want to cross paths with them while swimming in the sea ! the shrimps are super clean , meaty , tasteful and the sauce and horse radish is awesome . great starter . i had the argyle pinot noir which was pretty good . i also ordered the bone-in filet which was delicious , tender , cooked to perfection -lrb- which is hard to find -rrb- . if i had to criticize anything , i would like to have a little more of light -lrb- just a notch -rrb- .		5		1
how i live 1 block from this gorgeous shrine of booze , and have n't turned into a gutter drunk , is beyond me ! it 's sooo wonderful , and their prices are fantastic !!!! for the past several months , cases of fat tire -lrb- yes . . case . . 24 !!! twenty four beers -rrb- cold are sold for $ 11.99-14 .99 -lrb- depending on . . ???? i 'm not sure . . but still that 's sooooooooo low !! -rrb- and that 's just one little example of the amazingness cuz there 's so much moaaaarrr amazingness at sun devil liquors !!! they also have like . . everything that is alcoholic . sun devil 's makes those korporate hoars at bevmo look like an effing circle k. . : -rrb- the staff always knows the answers to any questions , too ! amazing ! :d and the basement bar is sooo cool :d and it 's probably quite apparrent from my typing that i rolled up in there tonight : d		5		1
wowzers , now this is an awesome gastropub . no ifs ands or buts about it , they have probably the best burger i have ever tasted here , ready for your enjoyment ... ~ fud/drink ~ `` the burger '' , as they call it on their menu , is one of the best burgers in the world ... its ranked . yep , i know . i am not a big burger person , especially in the latter part of my young life . i am much more content with a fish or chicken dish than a greasy burger . but i must say i will gladly cross the line drawn in the sand for this burger . upon picking up an already half eaten burger , i immediately noticed the weight and density . i was floored . it is impressively heavy , packed with yummy mixed greens , shaved red onion and the choice cheese tonight being provolone . the chipotle mayo is sublime , mixing the beef together along with the pretzel bun . overall , this definitely constitutes the afformentioned ranking ... its damn good . plus we enjoyed the burger and beer $ 10 special which they offer wednesdays . the entire tab including my lone beer i ordered on the side would have come out to over $ 28 , however the special shaved off $ 2 from the burger and an additional $ 6 + on our bill ... impressive ! this deal is on par with other nightly specials in the area ... i fail to mention the fact that the beer selection is very good , they offer enough lighter varieties for me to try , but they offer something for every beer drinker . ~ atmosphere/service ~ inside it may seem a bit cramped , but its not ... the layout is quaint and you are surrounded by fun sings and album covers of indy bands . they have a few tv 's with sports on , and the patio also provides a couple tv 's as well . it is darker inside than a normal food spot , which lends to the attics trademark chill vibe . waitress was average in speed of service , nothing to write home about . i had no real questions to ask ... next time i will pick their brains more . awesome hangout bar , really relaxed atmosphere , once again . ~ extras/rating ~ wednesday ... $ 10 ... beer ... burger ... special ... just do it ! they get 5 stars . why ? well , they have an amazing selection of crafts , an intimate setting and atmosphere , insanely tasty food , and heck , the best burger-beer deal in town . . i mean , its the best burger and some of the best beer ... in town , lol ! its a no-brainer . bank it ! shoo-wop !		5		1
based on the number of reviews , i 'm surprised how many people have been here and formed enough of an opinion on it to register their delight or disgust around the world wide tubes . in any event , this place is it . it suffices for any mood that you happen to be in -- chill , raucous , moody , bouncy , happy hour , just-passing-through , here-all-night , or last-call . day drinking is excellent here , as you have no awareness of the time or the brutal arizona heat . so is last call ... strong drinks and better-than-reasonable prices to send you on your way out to drunkenly find a nearby dunkin donuts . they have an interesting selection of beer , and supposedly a great bloody mary , though the time i wanted to order one , the bartender told me not to order it . i appreciated his capriciousness about the subject . it was late night on christmas eve 's eve , so he was right after all . the pool table is a nice fit without being insistent , and its pretty easy to get on despite some other reviewers objections . the only thing i would change is the jukebox , and not even necessarily change it , but add some more shit , cos i can really only hear the smiths `` half a person '' one time a night and i 'm tired of that jackass who insists on `` psycho killer '' for the millionth time .		5		1
i had waited to write a review for bianco because it had been so long since i had been last , i felt i needed a refresher course . last night i got one . i took a date there and we were quoted an hour forty-five to two hours and 15 minutes . seemed liked a lot for a thursday night , but was planning on waiting . i thought the stars were totally aligned though when i was able to find a spot in their tiny parking lot . i guess it ca n't all be perfect . so we ventured over to bar bianco -lrb- review to follow -rrb- for a few drinks to pass the time . we were pleasantly surprised that in about an hour and a half they were ready for us next door . we took the first available seating which was up at the bar . i have to say i forgot just how small this place is . the bar is nice , but we were both wishing the top of it came out a little more . it was a little awkward trying to sit on the stools straight . it does however make it more conducive to talking , almost like a table . the atmosphere was great and we even had a short conversation with a few of the other bar inhabitants . the bartender/server was very attentive and greeted us right away . took our drink order and he poured them right then and there . we decided to go with a sonny boy and the biancoverde . within 10 minutes , i think , they were both out and done to perfection . the salami on the sonny boy got nice a crispy on the edges and the olives were nice and salty . i was also pleasantly surprised by the biancoverde . it is a white pizza with ricotta and arugula . it was nice and creamy . we ate all but two pieces and left feeling satisfied . this is a great date place and i credit z for suggesting it . if someone has never been downtown before take them here if you can get a table . it will surely impress them .		5		1
oh i 'm totally crazy about zipps . its a great place to watch the game , grab some grub for happy hour , or day drink outside on sundays . for happy hour , they have different deals every day , inclduing both drink and food items . a personal favorite is the monaco foccacia -- a chicken , cheese and ranch foccacia wrap with a mild jalapeno sauce on the side . with fries and/or onion rings , this is the perfect hangover meal . we used to frequent zipps on sundays when you can get a bucket of beer for $ 10 -lrb- 5 bud lights , what a steal -rrb- , sit outside , watch football and play cards . fine , we 're nerds , but i 'm telling you , its the perfect ending to a weekend of debauchery . theres a ton of tvs -lrb- although not as big as some other bars -rrb- and service is good . on game day , arrive early to be able to seat your whole party -- or for those who want a more hands-on sports experience , try out the 2 shuffle board and pool tables . morning , afternoon or night , zipps is a great place .		5		1
south mountain is a great place for a nice hike within the phoenix metro limits . remember your location if you are disappointed by the fact that many hikes intersect with roads and that phoenix is almost always in view . this is one thing phoenix has done right . a 10-15 minute drive from my apartment and i can observe several types of cacti , and maybe even some desert creatures . there 's usually a nice breeze blowing from the peaks , and looking out away from the city gives one gorgeous views of the southern metro farmlands and beyond . although i like to take my time hiking , south mountain gives you the opportunity for a full hike including transit there and back in about two-and-a-half hours . it 's a really good introduction to the desert for anyone visiting town , and there are various types of trail suitable to both those in shape and those not so much .		5		1
absolutely delicious indian fare . can even get completely vegan . it 's small inside , but they turn tables quick so you should n't have to wait long . for our own food , we waited only a few minutes before we had piping hot , tasty curry on our table . we had the chickpea ceviche -lrb- recommended by our server -rrb- for an app and it was so fresh and cool and crisp tasting . then onto the bombay plate , 5 picks of entrees with lettuce wraps and each thing we had was sooooo good ... spinach and tofu , vegetable curry , eggplant curry , vegetable makki , and lentils . came with a little roti bread and we tore into it . for desert , we could only the sorbet since the other options had allergy inducing pistachios , but it was a nice cool , rich tasting treat . our server was severely genuine and sincere , and made us feel like valued customers . of course , she was from alabama so we would 've expected nothing less . a pleasure to have her taking care of us . a great place and i know we 'll be back here . 30 bucks for two with 2 large apps , a large entree , and desert .		5		1
sigh . i am in love . what can be better than brunch/lunch in a quaint historic home adorned with kitschy antiques ? nothing ! the answer is nothing . we went here for a late lunch one saturday , and it hit the spot . it was perfect . we all fell in love with the adorable house and its wooden floors , unique furniture and abundance of natural daylight . our server was quite friendly and pleasant , and she let us take our time while also suggesting menu options . we started with 3 sticky buns - a little rich for me , but very indulgent and sinful . yum . my husband then moved on to a cheeseburger , which was very tasty . my friend ordered the turkey sandwich , which was bigger than big . i ordered a cup of soup and a half chicken salad sandwich . all of it was very satisfying and super filling . of course , we could n't pass on dessert , so we tried the bread pudding . simply fabulous . i am dying to go back for brunch ... i 'd love to try an omelet and mimosa here . i 've heard the wait is bad , but we were seated immediately at 1:30 pm on a saturday . after living among the land of the strip mall in north scottsdale , coronado cafe was a much needed and welcome change ! any place that makes me feel like i am back in new orleans will win my heart , and coronado cafe did just that .		5		1
if you have n't been to lolo 's in a while you 'll be amazed at how it 's changed . at least i was . and do n't worry , the changes are good . the place is way bigger than it used to be . they even have valet parking now ! but it 's still as packed as ever and the food is as awesome as ever . i met up with some friends on sunday morning . we had to wait about 25 minutes but they have a nice seating area on their patio so it was fine . after we were seated the first thing we ordered was kool-aid . red . this is the sweetest kool-aid i 've ever had . they must use twice the sugar . but it is so good and it goes so well with the chicken and waffles . i always get the tre tre 's - 2 drumsticks and a waffle . they really do have the best fried chicken in town and when you get some of the maple syrup on the chicken , it 's just the best thing ever . my friends ordered a croquette to have as a side and it was disappointing . for $ 4 it was pretty small , and they only got one . it was not really worth it . go for the mac and cheese instead ! for a good soul food breakfast , nothing in town beats this place .		5		1
i practically live next door and have been eagerly awaiting for it to open . i came here today specifically as an end to my small business saturday . there are all ready so many great places in central and downtown phoenix , but they 're all either mexican , burgers and salads or pizza . this is such a welcome and refreshing change to that line-up . from the moment i entered to the moment i left , service was spot-on . it was friendly , personable , the staff was knowledgable , i could n't have asked for or expected better . the same with the food . it was seriously one of the best meals i have ever had . i started with a single steamed bun with duck . it was so good . i contemplated ordering 2-3 more and just making that my meal . since it was my first time there , i figured i 'd try something else for my entree though . i had the chicken katzu rice bowl . wow ! such a unique flavor . i can not wait to go back and drag everyone i know with me .		5		1
so , i had been here before , for all of about 10 minutes and was n't able to sample any food or beverage . on thursday last week i was able to get the full experience . i was taken here on a date . that 's right , someone took me here . that was a nice change of pace . we got there around 8 on a thursday night and the place was n't too busy . we sat inside right next to the roll up doors . the place used to be a firehouse . so there was perfect weather . we started the meal with drinks . she ordered a bottle of sauv white . i finally got to try an argentinian malbec , full bodied -lrb- well that is what the waiter told me -rrb- . the malbec was very good . i tried some of the sauv , it was very tasty also . i usually do n't like whites , but it was n't too dry . we shared a small bowl of marinated olives . kalamata and green olives , very good . i ate most of it . for the main course i had the salami & manchego panini with pesto . omg !!! this thing was awesome ! very toasty and buttery . i had half of it with a salad . the salad was simple greens with flaky tuna . now , this could have been canned tuna and anyone who knows me , knows i hate this with every ounce of my being . with that being said , the salad was excellent . the tuna was marinated in vinegar and capers and took away a lot of the nastiness . it had a simple balsamic vinaigrette on it . i was very impressed with the food and ate every bit on my plate . for dessert we split a flourless chocolate souffle . it had a very large , ripe strawberry on top and a huge dollop of fresh whip cream . if you like chocolate , get this and you wo n't be disappointed . we finished up the food and headed to the patio . the patio is cozy with several fire pits and lots of seating . this would be a great patio for a day drink or to unwind at night . i have always wanted to try mate , pronounced maw-tay -lrb- thanks z -rrb- , a traditional south american tea . it was very good , but on first taste reminded me of a cigar . ask them for honey and put it in . very good . they bring out a thermos type thing of hot water so you can just keep refilling . i highly recommend it . this is a little gem in the heart of sunnyslope . great patio , very warm interior , great service , and great food . the food menu is small , but i bet everything is done to perfection . large , interesting wine list for the wine aficionados out there . i love when little local places blow me away .		5		1
this may be my new favorite spot in phoenix ! i have been here about three times over the last two weeks and every time was all around peeerfect ! i had heard of this place a million times and had never made it in , so finally my sister was in town to visit from san fran -lrb- total foody might i add -rrb- and i paid fuego bistro a visit ! we were impressed ! first of all their specialty-the empanade , was excellent , which you would expect considering it is the specialty ... but seriously it was great right down to the house made salsa on top ! we happened to be there at a slow time between lunch and dinner and our waiter was also our bartender and he made one of the best mohitos i have ever had state side ! i was n't going to drink -lrb- driving -rrb- but , after seeing my sister 's , i had to try one ! the pork nachos are fabulous : the chips are made fresh , the pork was perfectly cooked and the salsa again was very tasty ! we both had salads and the veggies were fresh and i always love house made dressings ! last time i went to fuego on a date and we sat outside on the patio ; it was very romantic and i ended up with the same server i had before ... he is wonderful and he remembered me ! my date ordered the ribs and they looked amazing and my tuna steak was tasty with the mango salsa and balsamic reduction ! i highly recommend this place and the happy hour prices are wonderful considering the quality and quantity of the food ! one more thing , this place is a little hard to find tucked back off of palo verde rd. and buried within the middle of a courtyard ... but it is well worth the effort to find it !		5		1
yep , good ol' simple home cooking , and by ` home cooking ' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving . if you 've never gone , do n't be scared off by all the butter references , it 's not that bad . the place is teeny tiny , and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place , parties of more than four , you 'll probably have to get split up . the omelettes are wonderful , and the rosemary home fries are too good . the bacon is so good . . i ca n't even describe it . let me stress i am not a pork fan , and rarely eat it . i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i 'm so picky about it . everyone raved about it here , so i dived in and thought , ` what have i been missing my whole life ? ' ha ha , yeah , i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint ! seriously , it 's unbelievable . it 's worth the trek no matter where you 're coming from , especially on a sat morning . afterward we checked out a small famer 's market that was going on right up the street , and then popped in circles records and tapes , also within walking distance . *** update 3/8 i just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes . i was ok with it , but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food , which kind of put a damper on things . def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing .		5		1
i have been the token metal head to the original lolo 's for many years . i ventured out to the new location with my sister , brother and my niece and nephew . this place is about 4 sizes bigger than the original . we were quoted a 15 min wait on a saturday morning . we were sat in 5 . the menu is the same , the china is the same , the `` drank '' glasses are the same . feels just like a slightly more sterile original lolo 's . waffles were cinnamon-y delicious , chicken was hot and crispy . the catfish was also hot and crispy . everything except for location felt the same . which is comforting . i 'm still a fan of the charm of the original location and will dine there before i dine at the scottsdale location again .		5		1
i have to go a bit further out of my way to reach this total wine , but it 's worth it every time . bevmo says `` oh this summer beer is n't in season yet . '' total wine says `` of course , we even have it in the fridge . '' bevmo makes you carry a stupid rewards card that gives you 5 % off a purchase after spending $ 250 . total wine does n't believe in stupid crap like that , their prices are good up front . i really end up getting lost in the beer aisle , not knowing what to do . saying i look like a kid in a candy store is an understatement , i 'm like a kid who has discovered some cross between disneyworld and neverland . all my beverage snob dreams -lrb- er ... my liver 's worst nightmares -rrb- come true in total wine . would recommend for liquor , too . if you ca n't find it here , what you 're looking for probably sucks .		5		1
we were in scottsdale for a baseball tournament and were headed to our resort . our plan is always to go to the supermarket to pick up snacks and breakfast items so that we do not have to eat out every single meal . we had already been in az for a day and had a few baseball games when we drove by again . armed now with the need for many snacks for double headers and the convenience of the tjs to our resort , i decided to stop . the place was crowded , but did not feel that way . it is a pretty spacious store with a good layout . i ran in while sg stayed in the car resting . i felt like a kid in the candy store . i was hungry and tjs has the best stuff ! i grabbed fruit , yogurt and granola for breakfast . some ice cream bars for dessert . and several bags of trail mixes for out on the field . i am not a sunflower seed fan , but needed something nut like to fit in in the stands at the game , so i picked up some spicy pistachios , mmmmmm . the young man who rung up the order was very nice and asked me about the pre world series baseball game that would be on tv that night and made a little conversation . and then it was off with my treasure ! tj 's is the best ! and this one is in a good spot , good prices , open really early in the morning -lrb- before 8am -rrb- , and some super nice people work there !		5		1
not only does this place have an amazing selection of beer , wine , and liquor it also has one of the comfiest , friendliest , fantastic bars down stairs . let 's start with the upstairs : basically if you want to drink , they have it . i have found random and unknown beers here at reasonable prices . their wine selection is ginormous but the staff has created personal reviews that they display which really does help . normally i go by which bottle has the prettiest label but that does n't always result in success . they also have over 100 different kegs available at prices lower than bevmo . people that work here are really friendly and knowledgeable and provide great recommendations on stuff to try . downstairs : its like rolling into your friends living room and having a drink . i have missed my local bar ever since i moved to arizona and had really never been able to find a place like it until i walked downstairs . its kind of a two parter . . theres the main area when you first walk down . it also serves as a wine cellar . there 's a larger room off to the side where you can listen to live music and have a little more space to stretch out . i prefer the cellar area since its close to the bar and i like staring at a ton of wine in one place . you can order anything thats on tap or walk up stairs and grab something out of the freezers -lrb- like you 're at a friends place ... except you have to pay -rrb- and bring it back down . normally there is only one guy on duty so you have to be patient when it comes to ordering from the bar or getting your tab but they are so damn friendly that it does n't bother you . have i found my local bar ? yes . am i slightly concerned about becoming an alcoholic ? hell no , i dont go to meetings : -rrb- .		5		1
i have no idea what most people want when they go to farmers markets . i came here on a wednesday night with my mom , a dude from canada , and a dude from paris , france . all 3 of them , plus me , loved it . live music was playing in the background . i got some fresh-made pasta for my deprived kitchen . mom bought the sweetest carrots i 've tasted in the decades since my family used to grow our own carrots in our canadian backyard . we looked at jewelry and other locally made knick knacks . people were just milling around , which is an experience that 's hard to come by in the valley . so , while i 'm no farmers market expert , i ca n't think of a reason to deprive the experience of even a single star .		5		1
the pluses : - amazing happy hour . seriously . the flatbread for a whopping $ 6 is enough for me for 2 entire meals - wine pours are $ 1 an ounce -lrb- $ 6 or $ 9 glasses -rrb- during happy hour . yesssss ! - staff : male = hot + friendly , female = probably also attractive -lrb- i do n't swing thataway -rrb- + friendly the minuses : - tons of people -lrb- a good sign , but not particularly helpful for me -rrb- - parking side note : the last time i was here , lots of people were trying to use gift cards , probably received from the holidays , during happy hour . they do not take promotional gift cards -lrb- like those purchased at costco at a discount ... -rrb- for happy hours or other promotions , so beware . i do n't have a gift card 'cause the happy hour deals are so smoking , i can totally afford them like a baller !		5		1
recently , i have been to several major us cities , and in each one , i made it a point to find the best sushi i could , with varying degrees of success . one of my friends asked me , `` why have n't you found the best sushi in phoenix ? '' lack of urgency ? needless to say , we began a quest to find the best sushi in phoenix . it will be an expensive quest . and i think we started at the right place . we started with the miso soup with clams . if you want to imagine what miso soup with clam tastes like , imagine taking miso soup , and just adding clams . i ca n't really think of any other way to describe it . it 's really that simple . when the waitress took our order , we basically just went to town . and everything was brought out , for the most part , one at a time . this gave us time to enjoy each dish , and have a few minutes to think about it before the next item arrived . the first dish we had was the ankimo , or steamed monkfish liver . this delicacy is something i had in denver , san diego , and san francisco . here , it was served without ponzu jelly , but otherwise similar . the others in my party , who had n't had ankimo before , liked it . next , we had hamachi carpaccio , which was a hit . these perfectly garnished strips of yellowtail were one of the highlights of the night . after that , we had yellowtail tartare . this got mixed reactions ; i 'm not sure what they used in the flavoring , but i did like the spicy note that slowly builds up after you eat it . we then had the amaebi sushi -lrb- shrimp -rrb- , which was served in two stages : first , the main part of the body , peeled and raw ; and finally , the head , deep-fried . i had deep fried shrimp heads before , but it was a first for my two dining companions . really , the head is the most interesting part , and i would highly recommend anybody eating shrimp sushi to go ahead and ask for the fried head . next was brought out a whole fried european sea bass . this was one of the most passable items for me ; i usually prefer my fish to be served raw . it was a nice change from everything else , but i probably wo n't order that one again ... or maybe i 'm just bitter because the fish only had two eyeballs , and i did n't get one of them . we then started on a rainbow roll , which the others ordered because they wanted to ensure we had something `` safe . '' i ate a few pieces , but i never really get excited about rainbow rolls , or really any rolls . next they brought out the sushi : we had ocean trout , young yellowtail , and red snapper . the waitress made sure to mention that they were served with garnishes and sauces , and were not meant to be dipped in additional sauce . i liked that they were so serious about how the dishes are intended to be eaten ; it really highlights the care they take in making the cuisine an actual art form , and not just something to stuff your face with . my favorite of the three fish was the young yellowtail , but all were good -lrb- and fresh -rrb- . afterwards , we had one more sushi item : the foie gras sushi . it 's really difficult to describe the taste of foie gras ; it is distinct , but not overwhelming . it was delicious , and making sushi out of it is an interesting concept . for our last dish , we had the cook make us something of his choice . he personally brought it to the table , and explained what it was . he made us avocado tempura wrapped in see eel , with foie gras on top . as if the meal was n't already awesome enough , this totally elevated it to a new level . it may make me a snob , but there 's nothing i like more than having a piece of art made just for me , and having the artist personally unravel it . if you have any appreciation of cuisine as an art form , this is clearly the place for you . we finished our meal with the ufo dessert , which is a disc-shaped pastry stuffed with red bean and battered in tempura , and topped with ice cream . it was pretty good . now , i have had some pretty good meals in my life , but if i were look back and consider which one was the very best , this one would definitely merit consideration . it may not appeal to the fan of generic sushi rolls , but if you like trying new and interesting things , you 're sure to find some potential here . the quality of the food and of the menu is second to none , as far as sushi restaurants are concerned .		5		1
i had to `` update '' my favorite review of my favorite restaurant based on `` recent developments . '' chicken fried turkey : any doubts/misgivings you might have about this dish -lrb- ie : how can one `` chicken fry '' turkey ? -rrb- will be dissolved upon your first bite . i , as a rule , hate turkey , but i would eat this dish all the live-long day . cinnamon & sugar-sprinkled fried yams -- will make you sob with delight . be still my beating heart -- this will now be added as the ongoing monday dinner special . pity that i live so far away ... because the wife and i would be here every monday night from now on if we lived in the neighborhood . chicken fried chicken : at the risk of sounding blasphemous , i did not think that anything could top the cfs -- but the cfc knocks it out of the park . i will never eat fried chicken anywhere else ever again . bread pudding : well , another item i normally would n't touch with a 10-foot pole ... but here i would devour until i depleted restaurant inventory . i guess they call it bread pudding because that 's what the recipe says , but it would be better described as a mortal sin on a plate . so good and sweet and addicting that i ca n't find words in any of the languages at my disposal to properly do it justice . chicken alabama : creamed chicken and other goodies over cornbread muffins . it is definitely on the top-5 dishes of my life . if you have n't tasted it ... you do not know what you are missing . chicken & dumplings : see above -- to those southern folks who recall mom and grandma brewing these up for a saturday pm treat ... you will think mom and grandma caught a flight to phoenix to make these for you again . sos : always kind of a treat in the army mess hall ... but here they make it with prime rib . yes , it 's true . i take mine over biscuits instead of texas toast . will honestly make you think you died and went to heaven . again , another delicacy you have to taste ... because words do n't do it justice . presidio pulled pork : uh , well , yet another item which , if given the chance , would lead me to exhaust restaurant inventory . normally comes as a sandwich -- i just get it on a plate . usually disappears within 60 seconds . soups : steve could create an entire menu of soups alone . the variety is such that i ca n't name them all . but i have had most of them , and have not been disappointed at all . in the day and age of can openers and `` instant '' packages , to find a location where delicious soups are daily crafted by hand ... enough said . sorry to gush ... but you got ta get in here and run the menu 's gamut . to all those naysayer reviews ... sorry , but i just do n't see what you 're complaining about .		5		1
who does n't love four peaks ? this is a great place that 's good for happy hour drinks and appetizers or just dinner . the food is delicious every time and the beer is always cold and yummy ! the parking can sometimes be a pain with the tiny gravel lot in the back so it tends to be easier if you just park on the street . in my giant suv i find it 's easier to park on the street , personally . their spinach dip is to die for ... literally ... i 'd die . the patio is decent , not phenomenal ... the inside though is really laid back , cool , industrial feel to it . service is always great whether at the bar or table . i think at this point everyone in the phoenix are have been here ... if you have n't - now ya know !		5		1
the first thing i have to mention about this place is the chips and dips they serve . wow ! i mean woooowww !! they bring out hearty chips along with 4 , count 'em 4 , different dips : red salsa , green salsa , hot bean , and some sort of spicy sour cream dip . when you go to another mexican restaurant after eating at si senior 's , you will be pretty disappointed that they only served you one or two choices of dip with your chips . i 've been here more than a handful of 10 in a span of ten years . every single time , the food was excellent , the place is clean , the atmosphere is cool , and the service is good . i usually order either the chili relleno plate -lrb- green chiles -rrb- or the green chile plate . both are well made with top notch ingredients . they even get their chiles from hatch valley . to top it all off , after your main course , they serve you with a choice of regular or cinnamon sopapillas . i usually have to give mine up , since my daughters just ca n't get enough of those . their house-brewed flavored iced tea is very refreshing . it 's the perfect beverage to compliment the dishes they serve , other than margaritas . as you have read from pretty much all of the reviews about si senior , you just ca n't miss trying the chips and dips . all of those people just ca n't be wrong .		5		1
it is not your vegas buffet , but you can find a tour of asia in this west side strip mall sampling cuisine from japan , thai , chinese , and korean . we had a party of 13 which took up 1/2 of the restaurant . i had ordered the cha jang myun -lrb- black bean sauce with noodles -rrb- and sweet and sour pork . it is not the typical chinese version of sweet and sour pork . the rest of party had ordered kalbi , sul lung tang -lrb- a hearty , luxuriant beef broth made from ox bones -rrb- , and champong -lrb- hot spicy noodle -rrb- . the dishes were huge . i think i over ate , but it was just so good . our server was great and she thought of everything before we thought of requesting extra plates for our birthday cake . they were very accommodating for a large group . it 's a great place i will definitely go back .		5		1
the food is bomb . atomic style . ok , it 's not spicy at all , but it is freaking delicious . i had one hell of a goose chase trying to find some chinese food on this weeknight . it 's past 9pm on a monday , and i ca n't find anything decent . it 's scottsdale , so my only choices are : panda express in mesa , jimmy woo 's -lrb- no thanks , eww -rrb- , or go hungry . i settled , and drove to kfc thinking that if i was going to settle for something other than chinese , i could get a double down , and try and go all suicidal . then kfc let me down by forcing me to wait 10 minutes because all their filets were frozen . eff that noise . i drove around aimlessly and somehow stumbled upon pita house . it was like a sight for sore eyes . i 've lived in scottsdale for just over a year . i 've been out and about in the area quite a bit , but for some reason i 've never actually been to the pita house . probably because it does look a little weird . i guess i should n't judge a book by it 's cover , because this place was awesome . tonight , i ordered the chicken shawarma with an extra chicken skewer . it came with a side salad . i was pleasantly surprised to find a very thick garlic sauce -lrb- very similar to the one at zankou chicken in la , see my review -rrb- . amazing . so garlicky , citrusy , and perfect . the chicken was moist and juicy . the kind that makes you want to put your mouth all up in it . mmm hmm . yeah . it 's very nice . my meal was about 10 bucks . i devoured everything set in front of me . if you are into hookah , they have hookah specials from 4-9 , and also , some sort of lunch special for gyros . if i was n't moving away , i 'd be here more often . next time i am in scottsdale , i will eat here , and grab some falafel . seems like people like it . lastly , the staff seems very nice . the guy who helped me -lrb- i think he was the owner -rrb- was super cool and friendly .		5		1
so far the best vietnamese i 've found in the states . thats saying a lot - even though i still need to hit up some more places in la . . i was questionable of this place at first because the atmosphere is a little trendy and hip and our waiter was white . when i find a really good vietnamese its usually in a sketchy place with waiters who barely speak english . we got the spider spring rolls as suggested by the server which were awesome . then we both got pho - one chicken one beef . the pho was some of the best i 've ever had . the broth had amazing flavor . they had a special spicy `` grandmas '' sauce -lrb- which resembled the red pepper flake oil stuff you usually get a vietnamese places -rrb- but this spicy stuff was extra special and sooooo good . i love spicy . its a little pricier than the typical vietnamese spot , but worth it . everything still tasted authentic regardless of the atmosphere . cant wait to go again !		5		1
my wife and i visited today for lunch solely because of it 's yelp rating and because it 's fairly close by but mainly because of yelp . from the outside , the place has absolutely no curb appeal . still though we went in , trusting in 105 yelp reviewers and walking inside was like walking into another world ... very , very nice . very nicely decorated . service was fast and efficient . we were well looked after by the wait staff . i had an old favorite , pad thai . that 's usually the bench mark i use for measuring how good food is . the pad thai was excellent . had it with chicken but there were some shrimp thrown in . got the medium heat and it was delicous !! wife had one of the currys . ordered medium heat but she said that , while absolutely delicious , it was n't as hot as she 'd like it although she , too , had ordered medium . could be a mistake in the kitchen . anyway she said it was delicious . as well . we also got some egg rolls . there were two of them and they were wonderful as well . they come with a fruit sauce which was ever so delicate . very lightly pink but we could n't tell from which fruit it came . the whole entire meal exceeded our expectations well beyond what we even hoped for . we both decided that this restaurant will go on our absolutely - must - revisit list .		5		1
you 'll come to cph for the cocktails ... you 'll stay for the food ! citizen 's public house is my go-to destination for craft cocktails in the valley . these guys mix all the standards exceedingly well , but take it to a new level with their barrel-aged concoctions . i often order a sazerac -lrb- being a home-sick new orleanian -rrb- and these guys make the best one you can find outside of new orleans . the happy hour is a scorching hot deal , half price beer , wines and bar snacks -lrb- and they always have a great selection of all 3 ! -rrb- . the food is pretty amazing too ... the pork belly pastrami is phenomenal . the chopped salad is iconic -lrb- has it 's own facebook page ?! -rrb- my favorite entrees are the scallops , amaro meatloaf and lamb burger , but i 've never had a bad dish here . ever -lrb- and i work 2 blocks away and come here at least 1-2 times a month -rrb- .		5		1
wine on tap ? i think that 's an automatic 5 stars . went to evo for a mid-week happy hour and was not in the least disappointed . we sat at the bar for drinks and snacks and could not have been more content with the experience . the happy hour menu is slightly short on the edible choices for a vegetarian , but they happily made the arancini with marinara instead of meat sauce and were totally cool with splitting a pizza half meat/half veg . our bartender was so sweet and accommodating , we even got 2 rounds of pretty addicting ciabatta and olive oil as we wrapped up our second glass of beverages . i love that the red wine is served lightly chilled , just the way i like it ! though in a rather inconspicuous location that has been somewhat of a revolving door for restaurants in the past year or so , i truly hope evo breaks the streak and stays for good . the low-lighting , speakeasy atmosphere is romantic and laid back at the same time . the crowd is energizing without being invasive . and being only 2 miles away , i hope to become more of a regular before evo becomes too trendy in old town : -rrb-		5		1
i ca n't begin to tell you how awesome this place is ! the servers are friendly and the food is to die for ! i went with my friends for my birthday and i was kind of nervous with there being 16 of us . often times , splitting checks , ordering etc can be a bear with a large party . not at hula 's . water and drinks were kept full and she was always checking on us . i even got a bowl of the most amazing ice cream with macadamia nuts in it ... with a candle ! ; -- rrb - it 's not often that everyone at the table enjoys their food ... but it happened last night ! i ordered the calamari sandwich which was delicious . the calamari steak was sliced and on a sandwich topped with some really good slaw . i asked the waitress which of the fries were better and she suggested that i just mix them which i did . the regular fries were good , but man oh man ... the sweet potato fries were fantastic ! we started with some spicy edamame ... take my advice and order some of it next time ! you wo n't be sorry ! as far as cocktails go , i am not a fan of super sweet drinks so i asked our server what she suggested . i went with her suggestion and ordered the blood orange martini and ended up have 2 of them . all in all , hula 's made my birthday celebration very special and everyone enjoyed their time there ! we 'll definitely be going back !!!		5		1
if i want good pizza , i stay home and make pizza because honestly , no human hands can make pizza as good as me . i was classically trained by generations of my italian family to make the best pizza ever . its true . i 'm a pizza god of sorts . and then there 's grimaldi 's . grimaldi 's pizza is the closest thing to new york pizza as you can get . thin crust , coal fired oven , minimal sauce ... in short , the pizza that ny is famous for . grimaldi 's , i hate to say , is so good , it makes my pizza look and taste like it was made by a 6-year old in one of those easy bake ovens . so if my pizza is off the hook and grimaldi 's makes mine taste like shark chum , well , that 's the highest possible endorsement i can give a pizza place . unless they have pole dancers , which they do n't .		5		1
i do n't look for food now based on what sounds good . i ask myself what have n't i yelped ? for lunch , the answer was brio . while sitting in the car outside the restaurant i consult my yelp application on iphone and noticed matt s. had been there and reviewed the restaurant just last week . one thing i have learned , if matt says its good , its good . the first impression i had walking in was `` wow ! '' the deco was awesome - the fabric covered chairs reminded me of the hotel monaco , the style and detail was something i would n't expect to find in gilbert . service was excellent - tom , our waiter , arrived quickly and asked if this was our first visit . he offered to bring some water while we familiarized ourselves with the menu and upon his return , he went over the specials as well as introduced some of the more popular plates . the bread and tortilla was excellent - nice herbs and flavor . following matt 's review , i ordered the spicy eggplant and shrimp appetizer . tom said it was the best app on the menu . the eggplant was fried , topped with a shrimp and bedded in an excellent spicy sauce . yum!at $ 9 it sounds a little pricey for an app , but it was great size . even if we had a party of 4 , there would still be enough for a couple per person . as it was with two of us , there was plenty . my friend ordered the mezza lasagna & insalata - the salad was a smaller version of one of three standard salads -lrb- she chose the chopped salad -rrb- . the lasagna was good , not very thick , but definitely rich . it was n't outstanding , but had a good flavor and was very cheesy . the price was $ 12.95 , which was n't bad considering a side salad alone is $ 4 . good value with the combo . i wanted something a little different . i went with one of tom 's suggestions - the eggs oscar . many , this dish was loaded with flavor ! two poached eggs , a small crab & shrimp cake , potatoes , asparagus , artichokes , spinach , red peppers and topped with lemon butter & hollandaise sauce . the size of the portion was huge and worth the $ 13.95 . the reviews for dessert were good , and i do have my happy finish list to work on , so as tough as it was , i had to push forward . it is for research after all . i am not doing this for me , but for all of the yelp readers ... tom brought out a plate of 8 mini desserts and a cake . there were 3 types of crème brulee on the tray , tiramisu , cheesecake , cobbler and apple nut bread pudding . it should be mentioned that this mini desserts are only $ 2.45 - you can order the crème brulee trio for $ 6.50 or the dessert sample featuring the other 5 items for $ 10.95 . good deal if you have trouble deciding . we chose the cake and wow ! save room for dessert !! this was a chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream , chocolate ganache , what they called vanilla whipped cream , but it was more of a vanilla sauce -lrb- excellent -rrb- and a dusting of chocolate powder . topped with pirouette cookie . the total bill was about $ 45 , which is a little high for brunch , but the service was great , atmosphere excellent and food incredible . definite happy finish with the dessert . as others have said , this is definitely worth the price .		5		1
i think i love pizza more than the teenage mutant ninja turtles -- cowabunga ! is it worth the wait is what everyone will ask ? well let 's just say it makes it more worthwhile . yum -- indeed ! first off , if you do n't know , i 'm what scientists call a carnivore -- meat ! however , to my surprise my favorite slice of heaven was topped with arugula & ricotta cheese - biancoverde is a must -- oh yeah ! -lrb- think i 'm having a pizzagasim here ! -rrb- the bitterness of the arugula along with the sweetness of the ricotta was amazing . like dude ... it was awesome . our service was kind , fast , and speedy . ambience was cute , quaint , and homey ... with a rustic feel . i wish it snowed in phx it would 've added that extra flair of love and tenderness : -rrb- - enjoy !		5		1
what !? there has to be \ o ther reviwews + out there ... -lrb- corrected by 3 yelpers later , thanks -rrb- ok first it used to be a bank ! for phx its extra charcter for any building to have history more then 2 years ... but to be on a coputer in the frikin vault is cool ! piano ... if your really lucky ull catch one of my `` live shows here '' ... lots of options ... sugar free english toffee ! open late ! free wi fi ! great stuff ... i have never been wronged by the robot service here ... and half the time it was amazing service . . or at least cute girls that i thought where beter at serviceing . . -lrb- insert foot in mouth -rrb- ... no really been 5 times never wronged ...		5		1
it all started when i was at the new sinclair gas station on the nw corner of 40th and camelback that i knew i had to write this review . it was a saturday morning and i was driving on fumes and had to stop for gas . while sitting there , a stranger approached me with an `` excuse me , can you tell me where i might find a decent breakfast place ? '' i looked at him and said `` welcome to phoenix , today is your lucky day and you 're in the perfect spot . '' we are on the corner of all corners - and it 's saturday - which means abundant options ! so , i go through my favorite three options : vincent 's farmer 's market , lgo and over easy . i gave him a brief description of each and when it came time to give my rant about lgo , it went a little something like this ... `` la grande orange ! oh my gosh , you 'll never see anything like it ... look for all the cars and the full staff of parking attendants . look for the line going out the door . even more fun , go through the back door and say hi to the kitchen staff -lrb- very durant-ish -rrb- . have the french pancakes , the commuter sandwich , a croissant , or an english muffin . go look for great cheeses , fig spread , or affordable , small production wine options , buy your next birthday card or something you do n't need there . look at all the cute families , dogs and have a double cappuccino . '' he looked at me realizing that i 've probably already had one too many double-capps that day and as i said goodbye , and we both pulled out of the gas station , i could n't help but wonder which of the options he and his family would choose . the parking attendant gave them the spot underneath the 19-minute sign out front ...		5		1
went there after the movie on a friday night . this was part of a group and they actually let us reserve the entire patio ! what a concept someone who wanted to work with a group of folks . the food was amazing . the bacon wrapped scallops were awesome , the chicken wings excellent with a little kick , the batter idami yummy ... the pizza also very good . the drinks were very generous in portions , you got to mix your own . they brought a glass of crown and ice each time , i got add how much pepsi to add . saw that with others ... so if you ended up thinking `` straight up '' there was that option . the servers were plentiful , and the drinks came quickly . i wandered inside at one point to watch the end of the hockey game and observed the bartender and how it was all run . what an art form , these folks were moving but at no time was there a hiccup , and the food that passed by us from the kitchen area was also amazing . i will be coming back here and would highly recommend this place to any group where you want to just sit back an relax and be pampered ... and leave with a tummy full of yummy .		5		1
i had a really hard time deciding between 4 and 5 and i decided to go with 5 because for the first time in my life , i ate my leftovers : -rrb- first of all , this place is completely unexpected . being next to a ghetto circle k in a not-so-good part of town , i was not expecting the high quality of food and service that we received . needless to say , i was really impressed . we started with the margharita pizza and i must say , i have not had better . that is surprising because i ate pizza twice in new york in august . for my entree i had the spaghetti pomodoro . normally i prefer a capellini pasta with this type of sauce , but i was really impressed . honestly , i wanted to just sit and smell it all night long ! we were so stuffed after the pizza/entree , but michael insisted -lrb- heavily -rrb- that we try the tiramisu . it was divine ! normally i would be angry at a server for forcing me to order something i did n't want , but i will excuse him this time . i really like how proud they are that they make everything from scratch , fresh . even the desserts . i am also excited that they are opening up an additional location in scottsdale ! on a side note , they have really cute plates and bowls !! : -rrb- i can not believe it took me this long to get to pizza a metro , especially since it is the first place i ever bookmarked on yelp ! i will be back . many , many times !		5		1
if you live out here in phoenix there are a number of good bbq places , many of which have a strongly southern focus on bbq pork , specifically ribs and pulled pork with the meat served already mixed with or covered in sauce . texas bbq , at least from my own personal experience -lrb- born in texas and raised there till i was twelve and moved to hawaii , which has a very different type of bbq -rrb- , is generally dry rubbed and smoked and any sauce is put on after you get your meal , at your discretion , and of course , thanks to the bountiful supply of cattle in the early years of the state there is a strong focus on beef bbq and in addition , thanks to the many german settlers , it is also known for some great smoked sausage -lrb- in fact , if you find yourself in corpus christie take a drive out and go to orange grove , a small town , at least when i was there 20 years ago that is very german and wow , the sausage , but that is another story -rrb- . well , this place , based on the bbq brisket -lrb- always my ultimate test of texas bbq -rrb- makes some great bbq and even better , it has the bare bones approach to cost that is standard in many little texas bbq joints and many great food hole in the wall places in general . it 's not in , to say the least , the fancy part of town , all transactions are done in cash so leave your credit card at home , and the meal is provided on an empty soda crate bottom sort of thing with a piece of butcher paper on it and then the sliced meat of your choice is on another piece of butcher paper and when they ask how many slices of bread you want , and you reply , they reach into the drawer below the cash register , rip open a loaf of sliced wonder bread -lrb- or the equivalent -rrb- and give you that to make the traditional folded sandwich of sliced meat and bbq sauce on bread . you can also get a sandwich special but i 'm a traditionalist , i 'll make my own . in addition , i have an obsession with potato salad at bbq places -lrb- once again , an offshoot of the german influence , i would think , on texas bbq cuisine and boy , the potato salad here is classic potato salad . oh , and to drink , if you are off work , they do have shiner bock , in the bottle , along with a number of other beers and if you look up the shiner brewery website , you will once again , see the strong german influence and one thing that i do n't think is german , but definitely texas , country music on the sound track . now , for those looking for a luxury experience , you may need to go to joe 's bbq , which two of my 3 dining companions said they liked better -lrb- the whole slices of wonder bread did not excite them , but one of the people , along with me , was sold on this place ... it is very authentic texas hole-in-the-wall bbq and it does that well and if you are looking for something other than the no-frills approach to the bbq experience , then some other place may be more to your liking .		5		1
wow . this place is a meat lovers dream ! the meat is a bit pricey , but , everything looks so clean and fresh ! great color on all their meats ... tons of bratworsts and links , bacon , jerky , beef and elk sticks , shish-ka-bobs , whole turkeys -lrb- anytime of year -rrb- , and a lot of scandinavian foods . we met the owner gene , so nice ! he explained how he has 28 shops in minisota , and only one out this way -lrb- this one -rrb- . not only do they sell their own meats -lrb- and prepare them -rrb- but they have a whole line of bbq sauces and rubs created by him . he will let you sample any of the sauces or spice rubs , just ask ! he even gave us a free jerky sample , -lrb- btw , the turkey jerky is insane !!! -rrb- we ended up buying three pounds -lrb- buy two , get one free ... -rrb- i bought one of his spice rubs -lrb- special rub -rrb- and used it on my husbands steak this evening , he said it was super good ... ca n't wait to come back to get some wood for grilling -lrb- he sells tons ! apple wood , peach wood , mesquite , and i ca n't remember what else , but a bunch of others ... -rrb- this is just a great shop with great people to make the experience that much better !		5		1
you know the soup nazi , now meet joe , the pizza nazi . dude , it was your choice to open a pizza joint in the middle of the second most pretentious city known to man and keep it open til the wee hours of the night , not mine . learn some tolerance . get drunk enough to ignore joe before you get in there -lrb- which most people do without realizing it anyway -rrb- and stumble into joe 's after the bar . its open late and has the best pizza in town . thin , huge slices with all the regular fixin 's ... oh and garlic bread knots with ranch and marinara . its all ready to go so theres not a wait once you actually get in there ... and what line there is outside usually moves pretty fast . i have no idea what the prices are because i 'm either too drunk to notice or the chach in front of me didnt realize that he just paid for mine . you taking notes here ? just remember to keep your orders to the point and be polite when you get to the front of the line ... they may not let you use the bathroom -lrb- and you know you 'll have to go -rrb- if you dont . : -rrb-		5		1
firstly , hat 's off to jenn h. who had the cojones to give this place a lousy review without also coming off as insensitive . the story of the various native american tribes is an incredibly solemn one that is all too often glazed over in your average grade school american history course . i was blissfully unaware of it until my wife decided to dedicate the rest of her life to studying indigenous cultures and schooled me on the following - for 200 years , native americans were seen as uncivilized beasts in need of strict re-education to meet the white man 's version of civility . not until the 1960 's -lrb- and as recently as 1990 with the passage of several federal laws including the native american languages act -rrb- has the united states finally reversed course and decided to protect the various native american cultures . sad , but true , and something your average american probably does n't know and likely does n't want to know or care to know . thankfully there are places like the heard museum which does a brilliant job of telling the story of many of the tribes that were located in the southwest . i feel it is unduly categorized as an `` art museum '' by many instead of an `` american history '' museum . yes , you get the art - in the form of pottery and jewelry and kachina - but you also get the traditional clothing , the traditional cooking , the language component , and most importantly the history lesson . if you leave here thinking , `` that was just a bunch of pottery and dolls '' then you 've totally missed the point . the first floor of the museum has a great flow to it with each section dedicated to a different tribe . obviously there are many similarities , but the most interesting things are the subtle differences between the tribes . it also has changing exhibits on the second floor - when i was there it featured a wonderful exhibit on modern native american art -lrb- sculpture and paintings and jewelry -rrb- . there is also a heart-wrenching exhibit on the horrific boarding schools the children were forced to attend , often far from their homes and at extremely young ages , to strip them of their cultural heritage . my favorite part has to be the hands-on exhibit , likely meant for children but i could n't keep away from it . so what if i 'm pushing over a 5 year old to get a pipe cleaner and tissue paper to make a flower ? there is even a section of the museum dedicated to other non-american indigenous art and garb . what an excellent excellent museum . you leave much more informed and with a necessary touch of white guilt .		5		1
i had a very nice experience at my first suns game recently . sadly i have lived in phoenix since 1975 , you 'd think i 'd have been to a game sooner than 2013 . i am dissapoint too ... the action was face paced , the facility was clean and welcoming and the employees we encountered were all very friendly and accomodating . the game and cheerleaders were very entertaining and overall i had a very nice time ! my only complaint was the high prices and long wait for drinks in the mezzanine level bar . in fact the waitress forgot my drink , and i had to walk up to the bar and place the order myself . -lrb- oh well , that truly is a first world problem ! -rrb- ps : anyone else ever notice the the word suns on the basketball court floor is an ambigram and can be read from either side of the court ? me neither ! you 're welcome .		5		1
the westin kierland is a beautiful resort located in phoenix , not scottsdale . some close friends of mine from canada stayed in this phoenix resort for a few days , so i 've hung out in its rooms and generally lounged about the property . the rooms were impressive , beautifully decorated , and spacious . we especially enjoyed taking the kids out to small fire pits maintained on the grounds , where guests to our fine city of phoenix can roast marshmallows . the kierland has some tough competition , considering that the city of phoenix has every one of the most famous resorts in the valley , from the biltmore , to the phoenician to the royal palms . it does pretty well in a tough line-up . no offense to scottsdale , which also has some great resorts such as the four seasons . it 's just that the most famous ones are in phoenix . -lsb- for further information , please visit : http://phoenix.gov/bndmaps/index.html]		5		1
i really love this restaurant ! i discovered it here on yelp when i was looking for somewhere for my boyfriend and i to go for breakfast/brunch . the first thing i like is that it 's hard to find : i do n't think i 'd have ever found it if i was n't looking . depending on if you exit through the front or back , it 's like two different neighborhoods . the second thing i like is the atmosphere . the square the building sits in is very `` quaint '' ... that 's the best word for it . it 's a few old houses turned in to business , including a stamp shop . there 's a ton of cool landscaping happening in the middle , complete with an enclosure of birds ! everyone is really friendly , there is awesome outside seating , and just good service . lastly , of course , is the food . it 's nothing extravagant , it 's your usual breakfast food and combos , but it tastes like it just came out of my grandma 's kitchen . the pancakes are really good ... and that says a lot because i usually wo n't eat pancakes . one small touch i appreciate is that they provide flavored creamers , not just original half-and-half . the coffee is good on its own , but i like a little flavor . there 's no doubt we 'll continue to frequent this hidden gem !		5		1
not often does any place get the full 5 star treatment , but after our trip this weekend to four peaks , , , i had to fold ... beer - kiltlifter awesome , awesome awesome ... appetizer - panko crusted calamari - best calamri i have ever had . . this isnt the kind of calamari that you taste only the batter , but nice strips of squid that isnt over cooked or chewy , but delicate n the batter is delish as well , but can definitely taste the squid also , and the spicy marinara was ok , but the jalepeno ioli or aioli stuff was wonderful as well . the lunch - swiss mushroom burger cooked to order / med rare - done just right , even asked for extra mushrooms on side -lrb- no extra charge -rrb- . we have been here a few times for their sunday brunch as well , and everything we have tried has been very good . . my fave is the breakfast beer bread enjoy , n post your findings as well !!! cheers !		5		1
this was one of my stops tonight for first friday . i did n't even notice the place , when dottsy shouted out `` omg tammie coe ! '' i instantly creamed because i had been wanting to try a treat from here forever ! it cracked me up that i walked in , the only patron , and had to give my name and order to a boy standing near the door , then give the order to the cashier to fill . i could see if it were busy , but we were the only ones here . i got the gooey cupcake - dark chocolate -lrb- like my men ! ha ! -rrb- with a creamy frosting . how many ways are there to say divine ????? the first bite was moist and the frosting was just right - not too sweet or soft . it did n't get stuck all over my lip . they have pellegrino in a bottle , so i got that too . there 's even a bottle opener on the wall ! how cool is that ? dottsy got a brownie and i had a bite . whoa . a brownie that was still mushy-gushy and melting in your mouth . just the way i like 'em ! i ca n't wait to get a cake ! i may -lrb- if i ever choose to breed -rrb- name my first-born -lrb- boy or girl -rrb- tammie coe .		5		1
this is so much more than a store , it 's an experience ! i had some errands to run and the munchkin was so over it , until she saw we were heading to cabela 's : -rrb- turns out she loves the place ! i 've been a few times , but i had never had the full tour as provided by my know-it-all-8-year-old-superstar guide ; -rrb- here 's the lay of the land ; aquarium - when you walk in , to the right , in the fishing area there is a small aquarium with different kinds of fish . if you get lucky you will see an employee all dressed in their scuba gear cleaning the tanks ... believe it or not , it 's very entertaining to watch , lol . my niece and i also really enjoyed looking for sea turtles . mountain animals are along the entire back , between the stairs . they might be stuffed , they might be fake , who knows ! all i know is that it 's a great pic opportunity :d museum - back of the store in the far left corner -lrb- 1st floor -rrb- there is a small deer museum that has different kinds of deer and other critters -lrb- bear , porcupine , etc -rrb- . it 's informative and interesting . big animal exhibit - front left corner , just past the cash registers . there is a little open room that has an elephant , a gazelle and some others . very cool ! there 's a restaurant and game upstairs in the back . seriously , great place to spend a few hours ! : -rrb-		5		1
i am definitely pro flo 's . every lunch is accompanied by a generous helping of won ton chips , sweet and sour sauce and a fresh salad with miso dressing . my favorite dish is their -lsb- insert any meat here -rsb- low mein . it 's exploding with flavor and they let you customize your order if you want chicken and beef . the service is always great . the servers and staff are ninjas , -lrb- yes , very appropriate -rrb- -- glasses of water appear before you look up from your menu and empty dishes disappear . everyone who works there is always smiling and looking to help , even when they are serving half the city . best of all , this weekend , we discovered the $ 5 lunch special on saturdays . the line was out the door , but it was so so worth the wait . every lunch special highlighted in red is just five dollars until 3:00 . i was reunited with my de-lish lowmein for less than what i 'd spend at subway . now that 's something to smile about .		5		1
wow , what a great sandwich ! i did n't expect it to be that good , simpliy because i did n't know exactly what is was . it 's basically a super thin but mega crisp pita like pressed sandwich packed to the gills with great ingredients . i went with the number 20 : turkey with avocado , bacon , cheddar , tomato and honey mustard . what can i say but very good ! they had quite a few other `` sandwiches '' there that looked good as well . my sandwich came with this little corn , black bean salad that was dressed perfectly . i also got to sample this oatmeal cake , that was super good . all in all , great little place to pick up a unique sandwich for under $ 7 . my only drawback would be the limited hours they 're open , but i get it for the area . luckily i was home sick today so i was able to get there for lunch .		5		1
dude . i love this place . it 's walking distance from my house , that is baaaad news for my thighs . i 've driven past it multiple times and it never caught my eye . finally , i did notice their large statue thingy outside of the establishment . it was all lit up as i drove by during the evening . when i realized it was a gourmet taco shop , i knew i had to go asap . i went with my boyfriend and we both went to town on their chips and assorted salsas . my favorite was the pecan salsa . sweet and spicy ! for our meals , he ordered 3 tacos and i ordered 2 . the pork tacos were slightly bland and made me worry at first that i was going to be let down , but then came the chicken mole taco - oh my ! delicious ! sweet and savory , it was perfect . i know that sauce is difficult to make too , so , well done . most of the tacos actually do n't come with cheese - you know why ? because the tacos are so bomb you do n't even need the cheese really . their flavors are very carefully picked to taste a certain way . save the cheese and salsa for the chips ! you 'll enjoy the tacos just as they are . yum !		5		1
in a city full of chain coffee shops it 's nice to find this gem tucked away inside a dull strip mall . it 's a small place but laid out in such a way that allows for a good numbers of tables and a couch area . the atmosphere is laid-back and comfortable and the people working behind the counter are friendly . i ca n't speak to the coffee section but they have a decent loose-leaf tea selection and they will make it iced or hot . the only thing i found lacking was a selection of snacks . sometimes it 's nice to grab a muffin or a cookie when you 're hanging out . if you 're looking for a good alternative to starbucks or just want a place to hang out and read or study , solo cafe is an excellent option .		5		1
two more trips since my last review and i still stand at 5 stars . both times were with groups of friends . on one of my ventures here i was with a group who decided to try the family style . we had 2 fish dinners -lrb- amok & the mango -rrb- both were very , very delicious . loved the flavorings . we also had a couple of the chicken dishes and a cold sliced beef with vegetables . i suggested to the 2nd group since they were not familiar with cambodian foods to order family style . since i know pretty much what i like i wanted to order my own . i ordered the fish mango again . had my standard mango bo bo and ended up taking about half my fish home for a late night snack . will be returning next week again with another group of eaters . lol never tasted anything here that i did n't like . i guess that the fish is my favorite . it is a hard choice though . service is excellent , but just be prepared , especially with groups , that the food is prepared fresh and it may take some time before you get your dish . they do not bring all dishes at once as that would involve them sitting in the kitchen while they prepare the other dishes . nobody wants food that has stood and is not hot . what else can i say except that i just love eating here and will keep recommending it to my groups of friends . i just keep coming back !!!!		5		1
carolina 's mexican food is both authentic and delicious !! somewhat sketchy location , but if you carry out , the location does n't make much of a difference . my favorites are the bean and cheese burrito and the green corn tamale -lrb- i 'm a vegetarian , so i ca n't provide feedback on the meat , but i 'm sure it 's just as delicious -rrb- . the tortilla 's are handmade pieces of heaven , which you can purchase in bags for your own home-made delights . today , i put my order in around 11:30 , and the place was practically empty . but within five minutes , it completely filled up , so get there early if you do n't want to wait ! it took about 15 minutes for my food to come up -lrb- 2 bean and cheese burritos and a tamale -rrb- which was n't bad . the people watching is interesting enough to keep you entertained until your food is ready . if you 're looking for some cheap , tasty mexican food , and you 're in the downtown area , i would definitely recommend carolina 's .		5		1
mmmm , i love me some daily dose . i 've never received poor service here , always smiling , friendly girls . plus i feel like there 's always someone around to refill waters or remove a dirty plate . today our server was a doll . we stopped in around 2pm for a late hangover lunch . when i jokingly asked for 8 waters for my two thirsty girlfriends and myself -lrb- to convey our state of hangover -rrb- she did n't give any attitude about us not ordering alcoholic beverages or even a coke . she was very patient with the one in my party with lots of questions whose brain was n't quite functioning normally yet . when i dine at dd i 'm typically in the mood for breakfast , so most of my recommendations come from that portion of the menu . do n't miss out on their bacon bloody mary , chorizo eggs benedict , or peanut butter and jelly waffles . their burgers are really good too , and today i had the old town stack -lrb- a prime rib sandwich with an onion slaw , horseradish mayo on a pretzel bun -rrb- that was pretty tasty . a few parting comments : i hear they have happy hour from 4-9 monday through friday . that 's insane -lrb- in a good way ! -rrb- and , yes this place packs the house on the weekends , so be prepared to wait . but it 's worth it .		5		1
this is the kinda place you drive 30 + mins to go to . was that a good opener ? i thought so . anyway , i made a new friend in gilbert and i live in uptown phx but wanted to go to her hood to hang out and save her the drive . so i looked up some good places to eat via mouth by southwest and low and behold i found this gem and knew i had to go . we both got fontina burgers , which were amazing . she had the tasty onion rings as a side and i got myself some asian slaw , both were awesome . i loved my strawberry lemonade more than most people should like any beverage . i 've been trying to get my friend to move up to phx , where all the action is , but there 's one thing she 's got that we do n't : joe 's farm grill . that should be her claim to fame down there . i will be visiting her more often and ca n't wait to try more things on the menu . next up , bbq chicken pizza ?		5		1
i meet a friend here for saturday brunch . i never had heard of local breeze but the second i got here i could n't believe i had n't been here before . it is so cute !!! the patio and outside eating area is one of the best patio areas in phoenix . to start with , we split a carafe of white wine sangria and it was perfect for a lazy saturday on the patio . i had the fire island eggs with the country potatoes . the country potatoes were really good . they were cooked perfect and had red and green peppers and just the right amount of purple onion . the fire island eggs had chicken with cream cheese and green chilis on top of there homemade pizza crust and then eggs on to of that ! so decadent but very delicious . as if that was n't enough deliciousness , they bring you a homemade cookie with your check at the end . this place is great and i ca n't wait to go back for lunch or dinner .		5		1
i have been wanting to go to the one and only `` cambodian '' restaurant in the valley for quite a few months and we finally made it and loved it from the moment we entered . an aura of love , peace and harmony welcomed us in . loved the food !!!!!! it was my husband 's 1st adventure into cambodian cuisine . he is an adventurous spirit and loves most cuisines so i knew he would treasure the unique flavors of cambodia . it was cooked by mom who used to work for intel . served by son and daughter . even though it was busy he found time to converse with us . it was one of those lingering , thought provoking , conversation provoking experiences that stays with you until your next visit .		5		1
this cute little restaurant definitely has some bragging rights . even in scottsdale where the restaurant competition is fierce . you name the type of food , scottsdale has several places fighting for those customers wallets . with that said i feel that this place wo n't fail like so many others have . it 's hard to find a better patio ambiance in scottsdale while the weather is great in az . . enclosed by plants and flowers you 'll forget about anything beyond the entryway . even the hummingbirds notice how great the landscaping is and frequently will grace you with their presence . the nice acoustics with french music also lets you forget about the outside world . the creativity in the food coincides with everything else this place has to offer . fresh ingredients and well put together dishes definitely makes this restaurant a place for foodies as well as anyone who just wants a good meal . the prices are n't to extravagant for the dishes which are on the small side . this is a place to splurge a little and enjoy some vino while you 're at it . the wines are neatly chosen and i do n't think they are to expensive . overall i think petite maison has created itself as a restuarant that executes well on all levels .		5		1
buca di beppo will fill you up ! i have always been a huge fan of bucca . the atmosphere in these restaurants are very fun and support the theme they are trying to represent . i really love how they tour you through the kitchen on your first visit . very classy and old school italian vibe . i can here with a friend for dinner . i remember i was starving when i arrived here , and could n't wait to eat ! the service here was outstanding ! our waiter samantha took very great care of us , making sure we had full beverages and if we needed anything additional . the menu has a fine selection of pastas , entrees , and great dessert dishes . i ordered a pasta dish a la carte , i did the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp . also ordered the cheese bread with it . the alfredo sauce was very delicious with a sweat flavor to it . next time i visit this place i am going to try their spaghetti dish , and also try a glass of their wines . such a great experience coming here , and i truly do recommend it !		5		1
came her on a date night that included a nauseous tummy ... and i left with a satisfied belly and resolution to return ! we ate family-style , and i had the privilege to enjoy the tom ka gai , green papaya salad , and chicken panang . the waitress was accommodating , funny , and seemingly sincere with her candor . once the tom ka gai came out , and the delicious broth filled my mouth , i am pretty sure my body went into some kind of shock - there was nothing else going on in the world , except the flavor explosion in my mouth ! it was spicy , yet creamy , and flavorful ! i still frequently fantasize about this soup . the chicken was n't sparse , and i am actually drooling , just thinking about it . the panang and green papaya were equally delicious . not to the tom ka gai -lrb- the obsession is truly an unhealthy one -rrb- , but to each other . it depends on what you 're in the mood for ... but the panang sauce combined with chicken and rice made for a delicious meal , and even a not-so-guilt-free breakfast the next day . the green papaya salad was served with grilled chicken and sticky rice . the cool salad was crispy and combined well with the chargrilled chicken . i ca n't wait to try more , and hope you enjoy it , if you try -lrb- tom ka gai -rrb- anything on the menu ! i am positive you 'll find anything there enjoyable . there is a wide variety of pan asian cuisine to delight your tastebuds .		5		1
i ca n't believe i have n't reviewed this place yet . i work nearby and frequent jolta java at least 4 times a week . mostly for just iced tea -lrb- which is delicious ! -rrb- . i love supporting locally owned places and the staff at jolta java is why . they always remember who you are and what you like . when i eat lunch there they always ask how it is and for any feedback . my only suggestion would be more veggie friendly menu options ! even their caprese salad has buffalo chicken on it ?? their soups however , are fantastic . i wish they served them on more of a regular schedule because i love the jalapeno creamed corn soup but never know when it is being offered .		5		1
i found the food excellent , but keep in mind this is n't typically mexican food this is tex-mex which is a whole different variety . our waitress was fantastic , and talked me into getting the melted cheese on the side . it was quite tasty , indeed it has a bit of skin but generally if you cook cheese or milk included products into a liquid quickly it does get one . . and personally i did n't have n't issue about it . the menu is n't extensive , it would be nice to have a bigger menu but with how accommodating the are , you could probably something off the wall and they 'd be willing to do it . i ordered the bean and cheese burrito , which is delicious , and large . its a fatty , and i loved it . when asked if they cook with lard the hostess had an immediate answer and listed what they used to cook everything with . i was so happy . most have no idea , and are n't very polite if you ask . she was very friendly like everyone else we encountered there . i was told that the steak was perfect , and mr.hard-to-please was filled up -lrb- had left overs -rrb- and stayed that way the rest of the night . which was great . the salsa has an interesting flavor , and i must i dig it . i `` m not a big fan of mexican rice so i did n't partake in eating it , however the fan of mexican rice at the table liked it , -lrb- but not as much as the fajitas -rrb- conclusion - excellent staff , great food -lrb- its tex-mex . . not just mex so bare that in mind . there is a difference ! -rrb- atmosphere reminds me of some place that would be placed in a tarantino film . price is average sit down if not a little high . expect 2 people = over 30 dollars .		5		1
this is a family favorite , and my 5 stars represents that as such . if you are looking for an old-school sonoran style mexican restaurant , with a good assortment of foods on the menu , this is the place . you will get the good old fashioned , better not be on a diet , combo plates , fried goodies with cheese , and likely leave with a to-go box . you will certainly be able to find lighter fare , but we go for that margarita , cheese crisp , and whatever else is looking good that day . the chips and salsa are amazing . incredible happy hour specials - 1/2 price on most appetizers in the bar . and the bar is very relaxed , sports on tv 's , etc. . food is very reliable , service is familiar , friendly and efficient . frequently a wait on friday nights , so plan your time accordingly .		5		1
i 'd heard about paletas betty around the time they opened on mill . i remember suggesting to a coworker we head there for dessert next time we 're in tempe for dinner . and then forgot . in february , at the yelp treasure hunt for local love , betty was one of the participating businesses . yay ! a chance to check them out ! oh , and extra points in the game for a receipt from a participating business ? perfect ! now i * have * to get a paleta ! and i have been back several times since . sadly , dairy is not my friend - so i have n't been able to check out the majority of what 's available . but - omg - pineapple con chili ! non dairy , amazing pineapple and just enough chili powder mixed in to give off some happy heat . i could eat this daily ! everyone i have brought in has tried something different - and everyone has loved whatever flavor they 've gotten . fantastic !		5		1
thank you , thank you , thank you for bringing such a charming restaurant to old town ! i am giving the house a solid five stars and it 's because they have the perfect ambiance and delicious food to accompany it . the ambiance is what really sets this restaurant apart from any other restaurant in old town . when i go out out to eat , i like to experience the complete package : experience + delicious cuisine . many times , restaurants focus so much on their culinary creations that they forget about working on the environment . this is not the case for the house . the house is ` housed ' within the second oldest house in scottsdale . during my visit , i learned about the delightful woman who grew up in the house and how she loved her rose bushes . she was a member of one of the first families in scottsdale and during one of the wars , she would deliver fallen soldier notices and then lend a helping hand to the families while they went through their time of loss . the history alone of this house defines the charm . hidden in a quiet street that 's often missed -lrb- luckily -rrb- by the bar/club scene , the house is like a place you wish you could call home . twinkle lights light up the spacious patio and large and luscious trees surround the perimeter . the interior of the house is just as charming as the exterior . at night , the intimate indoor glows with romantic candlelight while the warmth from the wood fired oven heats up the environment . it 's the perfect environment for a date night or if you 're looking for a nice setting for out of town guests , etc. . now that i 've gushed about the environment , i will move on to the food . the food here is nothing less than spectacular , but i am not surprised because this is matt carter 's brain child and he also runs the mission down the street . i came here with a group of 15 and they did an excellent job serving us a variety of delicious food . the menu allowed us to sample the following : wood grilled crab legs with aji amarillo lime butter - this is buttery goodness at it 's best . the crab is fresh , completely buttered and delicious . house brisket & biscuit - this is a nice option for a hearty appetizer . the brisket is tender and well seasoned . peel and eat shrimp - spicy alert ! this dish as a serious kick and if you can handle the spice , this is definitely worth ordering . kale sale with miso peppercorn dressing - i 'm not a huge fan of kale , but i will say that for kale , they did a good job flavoring it and making it eatable for even the non-kale eaters . italian farro salad duck confit meatballs - i had no idea i was eating duck ! however , it 's tasty and just the right size to pop in your mouth . berkshire pork country ribs - the meat falls off the bones out of tenderness and it 's seasoned with a spice that has a kick . chateau briand , marinated jidori chicken , lobster friend rice , broccoli carbonarra -- all these dishes were good . none of them stood out in my mind , but they were still incredibly tasty . caramel apple upside down cake & crumb cake & sacher torte - pure sugary bliss !! i 've already written a lengthy review , but before i say goodbye , i will also mention their hand crafted cocktails . they are superb ! the drinks are made with freshly squeezed fruit , etc. . they are a must if you enjoy craft cocktails !		5		1
some places i wish i could give more then 5 stars because they really deserve it - this is one of them . the service was outstanding and the food was even better . for starters : i had the shrimp and eggplant -lrb- forgot the exact name -rrb- appetizer , and my wife had a salad , but this was not just any ordinary salad , the presentation was amazing and it tasted even better . the bread they give you free along with some kind of tortilla with spices on it - amazing . can 's say it enough , this place is amazing and it is now going to be a regular spot for my wife and i. for the main course : i had the 14 oz . strip with potatoes and veggies . my steak had such flavor and was in the top 3 of steaks that i have ever eaten . my wife had some kind of chicken dish that i snuck a few bites off of , and it was very tasty as well . they served her two huge pieces of chicken , and she could only make her way through 1/2 of one -lrb- which was fine for me - because i went above and beyond my call of duty as a man , and helped her out by finishing it . dessert : i wish , we were to stuffed to even move . final notes : we stayed and talked for about an hour after our meal was done and they kept our drinks filled and made sure we were ok . they were not put off by us staying either . this is a great place and if you have not gone yet - go ! it is a bit on the pricey side , but well worth every cent spent ! enjoy !		5		1
what can i say , except i love district ! the street-side dining is great , especially right now when the weather is amazing . the theme american kitchen & wine bar runs deep and you will find wonderful , delicious comfort food , carefully crafted by chef nathan . my personal favorites are the golden calamari , az sweet shrimp po ' boy sliders & the scallops , seared to perfection . wash it all down with a $ 3.75 -lrb- seriously -rrb- microbrew & do n't forget to save room for dessert . the pumpkin whoopie pies served with a mini bourbon malt shake will make you greedy & not want to share , but you will because you get 3 . they also have some of the most attentive & friendly servers i 've ever encountered . do n't worry about parking , district validates for up to 3 hours in the garage . stop by the sheraton & give the newest addition to downtown dining a try , you wo n't regret it !		5		1
the pupusas , yes , the pupusas are great . the loroco with cheese has become our favorite , but this past week , i strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad . all i can say is , `` what the hell ? where has this been my whole life ? '' the soup is magical . huge chunks of carrot , potato , and zucchini , with some thin noodles , and a savory broth with some mint leaves . i quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic . it was the best soup i 've had since coming to phoenix 13 years ago . good thing hubby got sick this weekend - it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more . being magical , you know it has serious healing properties . here 's where i learned that the sopa de gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the sopa de pollo is the same thing but with the meat . two huge styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $ 6.00 . i was stunned . the owner said it costs more with meat . believe me , you wo n't miss it . who knew that magic was so cheap ? hubby 's fever is already down and he 's feeling much better .		5		1
bookman 's is the ultimate sanctuary for add-addled adults with an uncanny ability to justify purchasing magazine back-issues in bulk . no joke - this place caters to my easily-overwhelmed sensibilities and makes me feel like i need to own tattered joycean hardbacks just to lend my apartment the smell of ancient books . it 's like park and swap jr. - there is pretty much the grandest selection of old junk , mixed with new junk , mixed with questionably-useless junk . all of this proverbial junk , though , seems completely necessary . the staff rules , and the credit there never expires so you can trade in your unwanted garbage for some in-store points and maybe buy yourself a gamecube or some elementary teach yourself japanese texts . in any case , if you leave bookman 's without a claw full of relics , you have way too much self-control .		5		1
i like to be a little stingy when it comes to five stars , but it is easy to create the perfect meal here . our group of five had a fantastic evening . it is also always nice when someone else is picking up the tab . we had to wait a bit in the bar before our reservation was ready but the bar is quaint with live music . the surroundings and restaurant are gorgeous . i wish we would have sat outside , but inside is nice . our group started with a sampler of appetizers . we shared the antipasto platter with locally made cheeses , and in house cured meats and pickled vegetables . the restaurant is making a very good farm to table effort . we also had crab cakes and the super amazing carbonara for an appetizer . needless to say we were stuffed before the food even came . i had the bisque which was good not as great as i expected given the reviews . everyone was very pleased with the food . the only dessert we had was a complimentary birthday carmel cheesecake creme brulee . amazing , i watched my husband devour it and he does n't like cheese . i was shocked and a bit jealous that i only had one bite , but it was his birthday . i would go back just to get another shot at the desert menu . service by bill excellent , he never had to ask what we needed it just appeared .		5		1
amazing . perfect for a romantic dinner . booked through open table and mentioned it was our anniversary ; everyone who greeted us congratulated us . asked us if we were interested in dining in the wine cellar room ; quieter and more private . beautiful there , but really cold -- they have blankets if you like . meal was impeccable . wife loved her heirloom tomato salad and halibut entree . my tortilla soup starter was perfect . the three little pigs entree -lrb- barbecued loin , crisped pork belly , and braised -lsb- ? -rsb- cheeks -rrb- . whimsical , fun , delicious and perfectly cooked . when i asked the server to sub something in for the polenta , he said , `` of course , what would you like '' ? terrific wine list and beer menu . service was right on point -- attentive , friendly , accommodating . our peaches & cream beignets dessert arrived with `` happy anniversary written in chocolate on the bowl , and was comped . literally nothing i would change about the meal or the experience . well done !		5		1
it 's date night and you 're headed to the movies . now the dilemma . eat a small mountain of hot , faux-buttered popcorn at the movies , or a little popcorn and a decent meal afterward . i go with both . only i 'm usually too full to eat anything of decent substance after all that popcorn so i typically come here . tea lite cafe . it 's cheap and filling and , its under ten bucks . i 've tried both the chicken based pho and the beef , go with the beef ... it has a ton more flavor . another bonus is how the meat in the soup is all very recognizable , putting that whole dog and cat meat thing to rest . a large bowl will feed two . i weasel most of the meat out of it when my date goes to the bathroom . and she wonders why i fart so much .		5		1
`` ordinary food done extraordinarily well '' or something like that , is their motto , and you can take that to the bank . joe 's farm grill is pretty inconveniently located for me -lrb- i am in north phoenix , joe 's is in southeast gilbert -rrb- but every so often ... it 's worth the trip . joe 's angle is that it literally is a farm , and much of what they serve is apparently raised on that farm . this translates into basic diner faire of outstanding quality . their burgers and fries are out of this world , and their onion rings are possibly the best i have ever had . homemade cheesecake , lemonade , pizza , all kinds of things on their menu that you would see anywhere but much better than everywhere else . the location is very clean , and if the weather is nice , their outdoor seating is gorgeous . even their bathrooms are something to admire -lrb- you 'll see what i mean -rrb- i do n't get out in that area much , but when i do , i always try to get out to joe 's . highly recommended .		5		1
the g-spot offers a smorgasbord of different flavors ... more than 20 flavors for sure ! a cup of gelato offered single scoop , double , and triple melts away all the trouble clouding your mind or for a brief period enjoying this sweet concoction of deliciousness and all things yum and creamy you put your troubles aside and enter the happy zone of gelato world . like any good gelato establishment samples are encouraged especially since there are too many flavors and the combinations are endless , like a scoop of the rum raisin with the roche . i tend to go for the gelato 's with liqueurs since there 's nothing wrong with some yummy alcohol mixed in with cream . at g-spot they explain the positives of why gelato is better than ice cream , it 's a spin but heck explain all you want and in the end i 'll look at it and be like ... `` of course gelato is better than ice cream with 32 % less butterfat , my body should thank me that i chose this healthier option ! oh another cup you say ? ok ... -lrb- tell myself , reassure myself ... it 's healthy -rrb- one more please = -rrb- '' . gelato mi amigos is worth the calories !! yum !!! this location is at the corner of 3rd ave and scottsdale , so it 's outside seating makes a good place to people watch , and the layout of the store has couches , and numerous tables to sit with large windows , and free wi-fi . it 's an awesome place and the prices are inexpensive . so if i 'm not feeling a froyo run , my next option is gelato and this is the place that i frequent ! oh and this is an awesome place for an after dinner date !		5		1
um wow i was a bit nervous trying this place for lunch since everyone says it 's so slow but we took a risk and we told our waitress we were on a lunch break . she was so awesome about it ! we were in and out of there in an hour , with to-go iced teas to boot . seriously awesome ! like , so awesome we went twice in a row . this is a frequenter . i had the roasted chicken with tomatoes , spinach and artichoke with a side salad . it was delicious . my friend had the mushroom and chicken crepes which she said were insane . and our other friend had the shrimp salad , also good . but from my eyes i would say my meal and the crepe meal looked the most delicious . i wish my backyard looked like their patio . im going to spend the rest of my afternoon pretending i 'm still out there relaxing .		5		1
camelback mountain is where my parent 's got engaged ahhh ! every once in awhile , in any season but summer , i come and attempt to hike camelback . i feel i am in decent shape , but this hike is n't a piece of cake . i prefer to stick to the easier trail on the mountain -lrb- i ca n't remember the name -rrb- or just explore . not just because it is more flat , but also it is way less packed . so you wo n't get run over my half naked joggers or bombarded with families trying to stick together . it 's a much better trail to be able to enjoy nature and still has beautiful views . parking is a you know what , and do n't think you will be the only one who thought it was a good idea to come early . beautiful mountain with awesome views !		5		1
oh how i love this chain . here 's the trick though ... put just enough spinach to hide the bottom of the plate , because there are tons of toppings . that way , you 're not filling up on lettuce/spinach and can enjoy all the other fresh veggies . then hit half-bowl full of 2-3 soups , then a couple of half-bowl full desserts and voila ! you leave satiated and not waddling out with the bloat ! and you get to enjoy a little of everything . everytime we 've gone there , the food is extremely fresh and crisp . the hot area is never stale . and the fro-yo is always a delicious topper to any meal . it 's deceiving though ... a salad is useless if you drown it in dressing and croutons . so skip that part and have a chocolate muffin with ice cream instead !		5		1
by definition , i am not a fan of chain restaurants . i would much rather support the independently owned ones - but capital grille was the exception to the norm . i just went there for drinks with a friend and was blown away by the service . to begin with , if you sit at the bar ... you are cordially poured complimentary fiji water - which i thought was a really nice touch . the interior is splendid with a combination of tables and booth and cozy lighting . they also have several private rooms and a chef 's table . they even have private wine lockers for which you pay an annual fee and the restaurant then keeps tab of your preferences . i just ordered a glass of mumm napa champagne and i could n't believe that they kept refilling my glass ! that was the best $ 11.00 glass of champagne i ever drank . matt and gregorio were our bartenders and were super friendly and professional . matt even extended his business card telling us he would be happy to take care of us on our next visit . considering all the steakhouses in the valley , the capital grille made a very positive first impression on me and i did not even eat there . their menu is quite comprehensive and their wine list is unbelievable . we even got a little tour of the restaurant before leaving ... nice ! i look forward to my next visit and actually having dinner there ! hmmmm ... just do n't tell them you know of someone who got free refills on their champagne ... that could spell disaster ... ah ah !		5		1
`` do you like middle eastern food ? '' this question started my impromptu tour of cool places i did n't know existed in phoenix . uh , wait ... where are we ? a grocery store ? i like it ! al-hana is located within baiz market - if you did n't know that , you would probably never find it . walking inside , i was immediately taken with the scent of exotic spices , and the interesting combination of hookahs and religious artwork for sale . i could have spent way longer lingering in the aisles - they have items that i have n't seen elsewhere , and at very reasonable prices . the dining area is a simple order-at-the-counter setup , with a small collection of tables and chairs . it is easy to see that everything is made fresh on-site , since the brick oven is right behind the counter and you can watch the goodness happen . ooohhh ... the food ... babaghannuj with fresh pita , chicken shawarma , and adorable meat pies . oh yes ! the more i ate , the happier i was . by the end , i was smiling and waving at the guys working the brick oven . you are awesome ! oh , and the whole table full of delights was only $ 12 ... too bad i ran out of stomach real estate -lrb- and was actually stuffed for the rest of the day -rrb- - so many other things i want to try and buy ... little pies that look like pizza ... baklava -lrb- ok , actually the entire dessert case in the back of the store -rrb- ... and the cheese , glorious cheese ! this makes me wonder , what other hidden gems are out there , waiting to be found ?		5		1
i 've been to taylor 's cafe on several occasions ... both for breakfast and for lunch . breakfast is served all day , and there is plenty to choose from . as shannon wrote , there is a variety of healthy options including several veggie omelettes and design-your-own as well . servers are consistently friendly and even when the restaurant is crowded , i 've never had to wait too long on my food ... taylor 's is good for groups but it works for solo diners as well ... guys may think it is a little bit ` fru-fru ' but they will not complain when their food arrives - indoor and outdoor seating available . my next visit will be one night for dinner - i think they have live music from time-to-time .		5		1
oh my god . was this a win or what ? i enjoy spice and indian food a lot , but i 'm always nervous about cleanliness and getting an explosive asshole later in the evening . however , my experience at tandoori times 2 left me with no worries , a belly full of lamb boti masala and flying horse beer . as soon as we walked in i was addicted to the smell , curry permeated my clothes as i began to salivate . the waitress was knowledgeable about the dishes and helped in my selection process . the side of rice for $ 2.50 was huge . it disappointed me that they did n't serve the rice with the dish , but it was worth the $ 2.50 we had a free cup of chai tea to top of our meal ! i will definitely be coming back . i 'm addicted .		5		1
have never had a bad meal here . full wine list that covers a large variety of wines . regardless if you choose to have the full experience in the back room or to just relax at the bar , you are treated like family . christopher himself will walk by and chat with you to ensure that you are having a good time . reliable and delicious ! pizzas are all good -lrb- although i will admit i 'm not a huge fan of blood sausage -rrb- . the tempura battered bacon served with fois gras is to die for . truffled fried or duck fat fries make you forget the day . and i 've never had scallops quite as decadent as ones dusted in vanilla powder . never a bad meal !		5		1
this place has been on the list for years , and finally after getting our act together , we met another couple for a dinner at olive and ivy . the decor , in traditional fox style , is perfect . from the lights to the tile to the bathroom ... even the servers are perfect looking . speaking of service , our waitress had this very laid back , comfortable air about her , but with confidence . she made some suggestions as we were ordering which were helpful . we had to ask a few times for water glass refills though . the drinks were splendid . i had a rum honey martini and it went down way too easily . the sorbet in the drink was fantastic . for dinner , i had the sweet potato cannelloni . the pasta was soft , the sweet potato just a tad softer ... it was seasoned perfectly and the sauce drizzled was a mix of sweet and savory . my wife had the mushroom tortelli and i tasted a bite and i love that earthy smell/taste of well done mushroom dishes . i could n't bare desert but they all sounded delicious . the only other dish tried was the salmon and i thought it might have come from a picture cutout is was so beautiful . a great evening out with some great food !		5		1
the whole experience was perfect !!! was here last sunday morning for brunch and was so thrilled with the choice in location for our get together . the staff was great ! our server was very friendly and patient with our party of 15 . the server decided to split up the order which was a fantastic idea . the food for the other side came out right after she had even finished taking our order . love when food is quick but not at the burden of the quality of food . this was not at all the case . the restaurant was pretty empty but we did not have to wait long for our food . typically it 's a waiting game when you have a large group . i ordered the breakfast panini which was delicious ! i 've actually been craving it ever since i was there . the panini had egg , mozzarella , tomato and spinach on it . the bread was fresh and the potato wedges were to die for !!! i was told to try their pesto sauce and fell in love . dipping my sandwich was exactly what i needed ! the mimosas were tasty ! wished that the bellini would have been on special also but that was n't a problem ! mimosas did the job ! they had a live band playing at brunch . he was very talented and the level of sound was not too loud for us girls to chat ! i will be coming back to this restaurant because there are so many delicious looking options , or maybe i 'm just ready for another mimosa !!!		5		1
my friend first took me here soon after it opened . since then i 've been hooked . i looooooove the food . my husband and i frequented often during the cooler months -lrb- pasties are definitely a winter meal ! -rrb- . i 'm a big fan of `` the pilgrim '' and `` shepard 's pie '' . the crowd is low-key and casual and the staff are friendly and accommodating . the only gripe i have is that sometimes the wait can be extremely long . i 'm sure a part of it is prep and cook time , but sometimes i feel as though i 've been forgotten about . ordering out takes care of this and it also keeps you from having to wait for a seat during the lunch rush . so glad to see local businesses like this introduce new food and culture to the mix .		5		1
i absolutely love this museum . to put it simply , the curators did an amazing job . the museum is well organized , neat , high-tech , fun and constantly engaging . as a musician , i found it particularly interesting , but even for the everyday music lover , there 's a display for everyone to enjoy . we thought two hours would be enough , but it was n't even close ! sure you can whizz through , but my buddy and i watched , listened to and read every single display . we only got through maybe 1/3 of the whole museum ! we are definitely going back to finish it all . as a strange and frustrating side note , i thought it was interesting that they displayed a violin made in germany on the israel wall . they could n't find an israeli made violin ? i find that hard to believe .		5		1
first of all , many thanks to the awesome deb l. and her fun-loving hubby michael , for hosting tonight 's uye at this elegant restaurant ! -lrb- it 's definitely `` date night '' material -- and not only for romantic couples ; i spotted a father and daughter , dressed to the nines , and they looked like they were having a great time ! -rrb- nine of us were in attendance , and i 'd say that the dinner was a huge success ! this was my first visit , and while i had to leave shortly after the food came out , i felt sad leaving this very lively group -- it was great to have caught up w / deb , mike , and heather c. , and so nice to have made new acquaintances ! i had n't even left the building yet , and i already knew i was coming back ! -lrb- heather , we 're definitely doing breakfast soon ! -rrb- while waiting for other yelpers to arrive , i 'd inquired about whether hb only served wines , since that was the only drink menu that was presented to us , but no , our friendly and very helpful server chelsea said that hb had a full bar , and that she would return to let us know what specialty cocktails they had to serve that evening . besides their house red sangria -lrb- $ 9 ? -rrb- , hb was also offering a blackberry mojito -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- and a st. germain elderflower margarita -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- . while both sounded delicious , i decided to go w / the mojito since i have a large bottle of the elderflower liquor -lrb- $ 32 ! -rrb- sitting in my fridge back home -lrb- i was inspired to buy after having some elderflower champagne flutes at chandler 's cork ! -rrb- oh . my . god ! if you like berries , you must try this mojito ! it was so full of muddled whole blackberries , you 'd think it was puree , and it was n't overly sweet -- i felt like i was having quite a nutritious beverage ! i hardly tasted the alcohol ... i very much wanted to order another one , but i knew i had to leave early . i can not wait to come back for happy hour ! :d by the time everyone showed up and had a chance to make introductions and make really interesting chit-chat -lrb- again , deb and mike were great hosts ! -rrb- , we were ready to order and eat ! i kid you not , everyone 's selections looked amazing ! i 'm sure we 'll be reading about their selections soon enough , so let me tell you about mine ... i was curious about the gouda mac 'n cheese from the very moment i read about it on deb 's prior review , so i knew to order these . how fortunate to see that the thai bbq baby back ribs came w / a side of it , as well as a green apple slaw . i concede that the mac 'n cheese was good , but i think it would 've been better w / more cheese and slightly more crunchy breadcrumbs . the sour apple slaw provided a nice crunch and just enough sweet-sour to counteract the spiciness of the baby back ribs . ohhh ... those tender ribs ! the bbq sauce was thick , sticky , sweet , yet had a great kick ! -lrb- i did n't find it too spicy , but others might ... you 've been warned ! -rrb- it was very fortunate for mom that i had to leave the party so soon , or else she would not have had the chance to try the leftovers ; there would n't have been any to take home ! -lrb- and yes , she 's already eaten the rest of the meal ! -rrb- afterwards , i stopped at the adjoining market to take home a slice of chocolate-peanut butter banana bread cake -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , a strawberry-blackberry handpie -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , and a goat cheese-chive potato cake -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- . -lrb- so many of the others had a potato cake as a side to their entree , and i was so envious -- they looked great on the plates , and everyone said they were delicious , and i completely agree w / them ! -rrb- loved the potato cake 's great textures - the caramelized outer crust had enough crunch , but quickly yielded to reveal the buttery potato delight , w / goat cheese crumbles all-throughout inside -- not at all greasy , and i loved the rich and creamy consistency that the goat cheese gave to the potato cake ! i will have to buy some of these to take home on every visit from now on ! fyi , the desserts were perfect , as well ! the crust on the handpie tasted almost like shortbread , the sugared top of the crust was exquisitely crisped , and the fresh berry filling also incorporated a citrus-y element -- my guess is orange peel/bergarmot oil essence . the banana bread cake was so moist , had beautiful texture -lrb- see pics -rrb- , not too sweet , and packed full of banana goodness ... loved the peanut butter layer under the chocolate ganache `` icing '' -lrb- no powdered sugar used in their icings here ! -rrb- . the cake also had peanut butter drizzle all over the top . it 's a pretty cake , and i would n't hesitate to order a whole one to-go ... hey , heather -- you free this weekend ??		5		1
i 've never been disappointed at any mellow mushroom that i have visited and this still holds true ! of all the mellow mushrooms that i have visited , the ambiance of this one is my favorite ! it has an urban contemporary look and typical of most mellow mushrooms , a vivid color scheme that is inviting . me and my boyfriend ordered a mighty meaty , which is a must try for any one . the cheese was perfect and all the toppings were crisp and their crust is to die for . the crust is what ties in all their pies . if you 've only had fast food pizzas or you have n't been to mellow mushroom you are definitely missing out on pizza nirvana . so do yourself a favor and do n't delay any further to partake in pizza pie heaven !		5		1
what can i say ? this is my favorite place in the world to eat or drink . i do n't know where to begin . at both locations whether it 's busy as all hell or dead , we are always seated pretty promptly . the beer is top notch . kiltlifter is my # 1 favorite beer of all time . i 've tried them all and they are all very competitive but kiltlifter takes the cake . onto the foodies . without a doubt , any burger on the menu is going to be monstrous and delightful . mushroom and swiss is my backup but i 've recently fallen in love with the jalapeno burger . it 's cream cheese , roasted jalapenos -lrb- not spicy -rrb- and onion straws . for $ 9 you ca n't beat it . i really have n't strayed away from my favorites -lrb- i tend to stick with what i love -rrb- but anything anyone has ordered on the menu , there has never been a complaint . without a doubt , if you are just visiting for a day or two in tempe or scottsdale , this is the place you want to go for lunch or dinner . it will save you on the pocketbook and you 'll leave with a smile on your face . they also play wonderful music and have lots and lots of television . i have also never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to sit at a table .		5		1
i love julia baker !!! i told her that i 'm going to move into her shop and eat chocolate forever ... well maybe not because i would miss my husband , but this is the place for all things chocolate in the valley . and julia baker is so incredibly welcoming on top of that . she hosted a group of yelp elites for the dine around the biltmore event and the things she let us sample were to . die . for . on top of that she sent us home with a little box of chocolates . i ca n't wait to bring my husband back here ! thank you julia baker for your wonderful hospitiality and your love of chocolate . it shows in everything you touch and i know you have even bigger things ahead ! let me know if you ever need a taste tester . i will gladly volunteer my services for free , teehee . : -rrb-		5		1
with award shows and ceremonies , there are categories and nominees . best actor in a drama . best comedy or musical . best director . well , if `` best local brewery '' were a category , i think four peaks would win , hands down . of course , i have n't been to every single brewery here in phoenix , but i have been to enough bars to know that there 's something endearing and cool about four peaks . perhaps as a stand-alone bar , it would be mediocre . the fact that it 's a local brew house makes it even cooler . it 's like the average guy getting a thousand dollar make over . he just looks fabulous , does n't he ? got ta love the exposed brick walls , the open yet enclosed feeling of the layout with tables surrounding the bar area , which is in the center . the ceilings are high . the tvs are dedicated to sports . the huge chalk board boasts a diverse menu . there 's also a pretty big patio out front . the doorman was nice - even humorous . i was instantly `` in like '' with this place . four peaks has quite the crowd of fans , too . be weary if you plan to hit this place up on a friday around 8 . you 'll bump head-first into the `` happy hour meets dinner crowd . '' no bueno if you 're looking for a seat at the bar . good luck finding a table , too . you might as well just order yourself a beer and find somewhere to stand out of the way of the bus boys and friend clans . interestingly enough , as dinner time expires , the crowd thins . finding a seat at the bar around 9 and 9:30 at night becomes less of a challenge . did you take note of that ? you should . i 'm sayin ' this : do n't be afraid to mosey up to four peaks around 10 o'clock . it 's less crowded than if you came two hours earlier . trust me on this one . also , bring all the good karma you can find . you 'll need it to find a parking spot on the street that 's a short walk to the front door . otherwise , you may have to put your peds to good work . not that it 's a big deal , unless it 's a frosty january night or muggy/bright/furiously hot summer day . beer 's are cheap , too . under $ 3 for their oatmeal stout , which is my brew of choice . sure , i bet the others are worth their weight , but once i find what works for me , i stick with it . so , if you go and you find something worth drinking , let me know . note : not the brightest bulbs behind the bar . our 2nd round was free by default . we got served . we just did n't get charged . bonus !		5		1
finally a raw food cafe that is n't in tempe . love their drinks and raw food menu . just wish their prices would come down bit . this is the type of place i could eat at everyday . i know it is good because the afternoon lull does n't happen to me when i eat here . i do not go daily , due to pricing , but i would like too , because i would simply live longer eating here . your body buzzes with clean energy -lrb- non-caffeine -rrb- after eating here . if you are a person who wants to be nice to your body . splurge and give your body what it craves ... enzymes . who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee ... . . ?		5		1
the suspense and build up by food media was no joking matter as i can finally attest to one of the most acclaimed pizza joints on american soil ! as the great bobby flay had once announced to a crowd of phoenicians that bianco 's pie can very well stack up against some of the best in new york , if not the best in the nation . regardless of who said what , i truly enjoyed what i consider a good pizza ! wait , i meant a phenomenal pizza ! the one trait that i dearly focus on is the crust ! i love a crunchy , thin , light airy dough ! it even had a delicious taste to it , which i thought took it to another level ! the sauce did not overtake the dough as it was light tasting and just enough to cover all areas of the pie . the cheese had the right amount of cheesiness ! overall , it was very well balance ! the portion was just right . just about any grown adult could finish this in one sitting ! when it comes to pizza , i typically order something really simple . what i just described was their margherita , simply cheese and sauce ! with that said , i could not be more pleased and satisfied ! i came here on a friday lunch hour and there was no line , although it was still busy ! no hype ! bianco is worth the trek no matter what part of the country you are from !		5		1
i 'm a realtor and i had recently finished showing a buyer townhomes and condos in downtown phoenix . i was looking for a good healthy place for lunch , and i of course pulled out my phone and turned to yelp for their recommendations . coronado cafe came up as one of the highest ranked in the area and they did not disappoint . located within a 1920 's built house this charming cafe served up some of the best lunch time fare that i 've had in sometime . not only that but they have wonderful bloody marys that were only $ 3 . i went with a half sandwich and side salad . my sandwich was the pest chicken and it was delicious as was the salad . my business partner is from baltimore and when he heard the waiter state that they have the best crab cakes in town he naturally ordered them . he , being an expert on crab , was immediately transported back home with his first bite . after speaking with the owner we discovered that he too is from baltimore and has the crabs flown in special for his crab cakes . so if you 're a crab cake lover or simply a lover of good food coronado cafe is a must stop for you .		5		1
oh my nom . this place is amazing . we go to talking stick a lot but it was n't until i read in the best of phoenix last year that this was voted `` best seafood '' that we even thought to check it out . i thought that was kind of funny/interesting/odd that the best seafood in phoenix was in the casino and therefore was very intrigued . the combo gumbo is soooooooooooooo good . sausage , shrimp , okra , chicken , crawfish , oysters , etc. . get it with dirty rice . one order of this is more than enough for two people to share and still have leftovers . but it 's so good you may consider getting your own order . we like to order it pretty spicy but you can get it really mild too . best thing to get to drink with it is a drifter beer . yum . writing this review is making me want to go there right now . also , do not go expecting some fancy pants atmosphere . you will be 10 feet away from gamblers ... and slot machines ... you are at a casino .		5		1

i love this place ! i would come here every night they have flamenco dances if i could cause i love flamenco ! the food here is pricy for tapas , but i 'm not going to complain cause i thought overall it 's pretty good . i did n't know what my friend ordered , but it was music to my palate while i savor the moment as i watched the flamenco dancer sway , move , and stomp with a passion ! must need strong thighs and calves i gather . we ordered some finger potatoes with a creamy cilantro aioli , escargot in a red marinara , and some cherry tomatoes salad -- yum yum and yum ! the service was pretty good overall , but both host looks like they were hit mans ! no disrespect , but tone it down . suits are great , but i would go with all black with black tie to give that 5 star service flare . ambience was great ! what can i say play some flamenco music and yes you had me at hello ! - enjoy !		5		1
this is probably my top restaurant , mexican and non-mexican . originally i wanted to go there to try the churros with goat 's milk dessert . but naive me realized the entrees and guacamole are where it 's at . any time i have guests willing to shell out a bit more for a meal , i always stop here . there 's usually a wait of about an hour , in that tiny restaurant , but it 's worth it . their homemade pomegranate seed guacamole -lrb- cranberries when pomengranate is off season -rrb- is a must . and i love how instead of chips and salsa on the tables , staff bring pieces of bread with this oiive tapenade . i have never had a bad thing here , from the tortas to their duck . if i could afford it , i 'd eat there once a week 'til i conquered the entire menu . on weekends , they have live music which adds to the already casual , urban atmosphere . i once went to a cooking demo with chef/owner silvana . that lady knows her stuff !		5		1
what 's not to love about this charming house turned eatery ? the patio is awesome and usually full but even if that 's the case and you 're stuck sitting inside , it 's inviting and cozy especially at night with the lights turned down and the candles lit . mac & cheese ... my arch nemesis and one food that 's been my fav from when i was 5 . tmi nails it . so yummy and with the cracker/bread on top of it , adds a nice texture and taste . the blt with avocado is delicious . . so simple but the ingredients are fresh and you ca n't go wrong with chips and a pickle slice . tmi 's beer list is solid and i 've yet to try the wine but when it 's basically down the street , i do n't have to think of too many excuses to get back for the service and the atmosphere . by far one of my favorite places !		5		1
i was so excited when dd opened up since i love me some liquor with my breakfast -lrb- sorry breakfast club -rrb- . it became our new go to breakfast spot and never disappointed . i am a huge fan of their benedicts especially their crab cake bene . my friends are healthy eaters and always raved about their egg white wrap or the turkey and sausage white out . servers were always helpful and courteous , even when my hung over friend had random requests like 2 medium poached eggs and wheat toast no butter . mimosas are great here too so make sure you are n't hung over to get one . the owners often stop by tables to see how things are going and are very friendly . one time one of our friends was a little green from the night before and the owner brought her over an herb remedy to help settle her stomach . the place can get busy but service is always great as is the food . i have n't made it there for dinner yet but it is def on the agenda . great work dd !!		5		1
i really loved eating here and plan on coming back soon ! i came here with two friends . service was a little slow at first but was acknowledged and apologized for immediately . -lrb- to apologize our server brought us a piece of this cake at the end of our meal . it 's not on the menu , i 'm not sure what it was . it was topped with phyllo dough and honey and the cake part was kinda like a cheesecake but not , it was a different texture , lemony with lemon rind in it and not very sweet but it was very good . i quite enjoyed it . perfect way to end the meal . now to rewind and go back to the start , we had a couple appetizers . we started with the bruschetta - $ 3.95 and the veggie combo - $ 10.95 the bruschetta was incredible ! i could have made that my meal . the veggie combo was also just as good , but i have to say this : for those who do n't know , spanakopita is phyllo dough filled with spinach , onion and feta cheese . `` spanaki '' in greek means spinach . there was no spinach or onion on this . just phyllo and cheese . it was still so , so good , i mean you ca n't go wrong with cheese and dough right ? but i wanted spinach and onion ! the falafel looked like a hush puppy from long john silvers , but was a hundred times better . for my entree i had the lamb souvlaki dinner - $ 12.95 . so tasty , perfectly cooked and seasoned . mmmmmmmmmmmmmm . oh note to the staff . when it 's night and people are sitting on the patio , light a candle and turn on your decorative outdoor lights . some of us like to see what we eat ! . still 5 stars !		5		1
i ca n't believe i did n't have a review up for ikea ... almost everything in my house is from there -lrb- & no , teasing friends , none of it is particle board ! -rrb- . : -- rrb - a lot of ikea furniture items come kdf -lrb- knocked down flat -rrb- & as things from hasbro , `` you put it together '' . however , let me tell you ... ! when i moved over here from l.a. in january ' 09 , rather than having to pay bekins thousands of dollars , i just kdf 'd my houseful of furniture & almost everything fit in my ram 3500 van for the move ! when i was a kid , sears was where you bought everything from a horse to a house & everything in it . while ikea does n't sell horses -lrb- whole ! -rrb- or houses -lrb- or power tools -rrb- , they do have almost everything else , and always at great prices . : -- rrb - another ikea feature is their very wide range of prices for individual items so you can spend whatever you want . today , for instance , i was shopping for a living room rug . i found a big collection of them , priced from $ 20 to $ 800 ! i also needed a new door mat & they had lots of them too ! i found just what i wanted in a sindal , for only $ 5 ! -lrb- everything here has a name ! -rrb- another thing about ikea is that they rearrange the whole huge store all the time to keep your shopping interesting and fun for every visit . there 's an inexpensive restaurant too , with delicious food , and last but not least , the employees are great ! i love ikea ! : -- rrb - -rrb- = = = = = = 6/25/13 mini update rave : the main store opens at 10 , but the restaurant at 8 am . i stopped in here a little before 10 this morning & enjoyed breakfast for 99 cents ! this was scrambled eggs , home style potatoes , bacon , plus all you want of their delicious coffee . what a treat for the price ! want more ? it 's all free on mondays ! : -- rrb - -rrb-		5		1
i 've been wanting to try deseo for awhile now , as the westin is where my husband and i stayed on our wedding night . we finally had the opportunity to eat here while my husband 's uncle was staying at the westin for a business trip . the restaurant itself as a really nice atmosphere and has an entrance downstairs from the hotel lobby . because you go downstairs , it does n't really feel like a hotel restaurant , which was really nice . the restaurant is bid and very well decorated and has a nice view to the grounds outside . the food we partook in was awesome . we were all watching our carbs , so we did n't try the bread , which was served before the meal , but it looked great . i opted for the flat iron steak and the hubs go the chimicurri steak . my oh my we were both in seventh heaven . my steak was juicy and full of flavor . even the asparagus on the side was amazing . i ate every bite of my meal as did everyone else at the table . i 'm still thinking about that steak months later . though the meal was expensive -lrb- due to drinks and entrees -rrb- we had a localdines coupon , which offset it a bit . in my opinion , it was worth every penny !		5		1
we had high expectations and were not disappointed . we brought our own wine , made reservations and everything went smoothly . we were greeted at the door by the owner who introduced himself and seemed very pleasant which was refreshing . we were seated promptly and the server was right there to start us off . we selected the onion tart appetizer . it was good ... really good ... we devoured it . our main course was lamb for her and filet for me . the lamb literally fell off the bone . it was served with a medley of other treats including figs which were very tasty . my filet was cooked just right and served with a generous side of asparagus and some of the best risotto i have had in a very long time . there was this blend of cheese and sweet moroccan spices in the risotto that was to die for ... i think i might have actually blacked out for a moment while eating it . hell , i am getting light-headed remembering the flavors as i write this review . we finished by sharing the four berry tart for dessert which was good . it was n't too sweet and it let berries do most of the talkin ' . our server was a lovely gal who was pregnant . i only mention this fact because i ca n't remember her name but she was terrific and did a great job . the dining area is small and intimate but we knew this before we went so it was not a problem at all . in fact looking back i rather enjoyed our small corner table next to the widow . i do n't dole out 5 stars very often but this place really got it right .		5		1
i was king for a day . while staying a the royal palms i felt like the world was my oyster , every wish was my command and everything i desired seemed to be thought of before i desired it . in short , customer service here is phenomenal . astounding even . the resort has beautiful grounds , a nice bar area , the basic room is fairly roomie and has a big ole bathtub in it , the pool is open twenty four hours ... this is seriously huge for me because i work graveyard and honestly want to take a dip at 3am , i truly walked away unable to think of something that could have been better ... and while i think i got my room for a steal , knowing how amazing this place is , i will have no problem paying full price the next time a staycation comes up . you just have to visit , look for a deal or whatever you need to do , but if the opportunity to stay here comes up , take it . you will love it .		5		1
this place is awesome . there 's plenty of parking and i park my car far enough away to avoid all the bad drivers , after all , this is primarily an asian superstore . but there 's also a melting pot of all types of shapes , sizes and nationalities shopping for a taste called home of their native foods . they have their aisles clearly marked by nationality whether it be from japan , argentina , brazil , africa , philippines , vietnam , etc. . i 've been here a few times and the best time to avoid the frenzied crowd is late afternoons or evening -lrb- especially on the weekend -rrb- . you do n't want to go toe to toe with one of those mama-sans that 's on a mission . lee lee sells just about anything you can imagine . my wife even bought an ice shaver along with the sweet beans to make her halo halo -lrb- filipino style -rrb- . the workers at the store are always happy to help you find things as was the case of the ice shaver . my kids bought their favorite korean treats ; correction , i bought their favorite korean treats . we bought a pound of ground pork , for way less than your average grocery store , to make some egg rolls -lrb- boy were they good -rrb- . their selection of meats and fish is ginormous ! but the main mission this past weekend was to snag those large manila mangoes for our weekly smoothie requirements . 12 mangoes with each about the size of my foot for $ 12 , woo-hoo ! i 've become addicted to this place and will be back this weekend .		5		1
tried this place out for drinks and dinner . my moscow mule came in its own moscow mule cup ! it was super delicious and hard to resist a second one , so i did n't ! dinner menu is n't extensive however the burger i ordered -lrb- minus onions -rrb- was unbelievably awesome . it bursted with flavor and made it difficult to resist a second one , which this time i did resist : -rrb- our servers were very gracious and accommodating . i purchased a blonde brownie on the way out . it was pretty tasty but would have been better if i had waited til i got home to eat it . i needed a glass of milk and it needed about 20 seconds in the micro !		5		1
okay , you caught me . i f 'n love this place . it 's the place i want to go when i want to somewhere - so forgive me friends if i pester you with going out , for i often have a hankering from what the lost leaf is selling . it 's an art bar , with incredible beers to pick from and music to listen to . i ca n't get enough of this place . if it tells you anything , i chose to hang out here to celebrate my birthday this past february . it 's the one and only place i wanted to go , and i am so thrilled my friends either a -rrb- already loved this place or b -rrb- heard such great things about the lost leaf , they could n't wait to check it out . at the end of the night , everyone in my party were lost leaf believers . amen ! * * * my first review of the lost leaf : i absolutely love this place ! hardwood floors . exposed brick walls and columns . a high ceiling . low lighting . art on the walls . fun coasters on the table . hues of red wafting through the interior . plenty of tables and seats , even in different `` sections '' of the place . a cozy bar with an impressive beer menu . i love love love the lost leaf . after watching lars and the real girl -lrb- an outstanding movie , btw -rrb- , my comrade and i ventured to find a beer . not just any beer . i told him the roosevelt had a great hazelnut brown -lrb- from rogue -rrb- . i was itchin ' for that . well , i texted google to find the address to the roosevelt , but nothing came back . -lrb- it 's true , you can text google for just about anything now ! -rrb- having realized the lost leaf was in the same area , i texted google again . success ! so , we headed toward that area and stumbled upon the lost leaf . -lrb- i know it 's hard to stumble upon anything when you have the direct address , but humor me . -rrb- for a sunday night around 8 , this place was semi-busy . about 5 people at the bar and a couple tables occupied . of course , the bartender was quick to tell us that last sunday was a bit heavier with traffic , and if we stuck around , we 'd get to hear one of the best local jazz bands . too bad we really had n't planned to stay out that late , for i do love jazz . the bartender went on to tell me two things i did n't know . 1 . there 's a third friday that 's supposedly better than first friday because it 's not over-run by band-wagoners . awesome . 2 . if you peddle your bike to the bar , your first beer is a buck . yep , just one dollar . you ca n't beat that ! -lrb- you do n't actually peddle to the bar . you can park your bike outside . -rrb- i felt right at home at this place . i ca n't put my finger on just one thing . i think it 's the entire experience , from decor and service to even the music , for whatever xm or satellite station they had on , it played black rebel motorcycle club 's `` weapon of choice . '' % & * # $ !!! there 's nothing like a favorite song by a favorite band to trigger great memories and jump-start really good conversations . but , enough about that . let 's talk beer . i knew right away what i wanted when i saw they offered the rogue hazelnut brown . 22 oz . yes ! -lrb- and for $ 7 . -rrb- my friend got the monk madness , also from rogue , and enjoyed it very much . we sampled each other 's and concurred : we each made the right choice . 22 oz is alot to swallow , so i took my time , enjoying how the 13 ingredient beer hit the spot . ahhh ... ! i definitely will be back to the lost leaf . i feel like it 's my kind of place . i guess if i had to pick any place in phoenix that reflected my personality , i 'd pick this one . i think it has character , a unique and clear vibe , catering to artistic expression and `` mood '' lighting . plus , there 's also wine available for the nights i 'm feeling like slipping into a happy , relaxed state of mind . definitely , this place is where i can get lost from the everyday hum-drum and just be myself .		5		1
awesome pizza ! you want more details ? yesterday -lrb- my first time at pizzeria bianco -rrb- i arrived at 5 minutes to 3 - i was second in the line . as time passed , and more people arrived , we began chatting . just wandering from conversation to conversation - very relaxed - very laidback - casual - fun . the family in 3rd place turned out to be regulars . they 're italian . they chatted amongst themselves in italian . they chatted with the rest of us in english - with a noticeable italian accent . the hostess -lrb- who is a knockout ! -rrb- was charming . i have no idea about the reviews claiming that she 's rude . get some people skills people ! being solo , i sat at the bar . a glass of dos cabesas & a margherita with red onions & garlic . those of us at the bar - all strangers to each other - chatted like we were at party at our next door neighbors ' . the ambience of this former machine shop - with the wood-burning brick pizza oven - is charming & romantic . i will have to return with my gf . the wine was smooth and delicious . the pizza -- now yuh got ta understand - i worked at gino 's pizza on east mcdowell before you were born -- was amazing ! but , that 's exactly what i expected . my mouth told me that it 's so very happy i took it to bianco , and i like to make my mouth happy . so , go . expect to wait . relax . chat with people . have fun . your mouth will . awesome pizza ! any questions ?		5		1
best tacos i 've ever had , hands down . also the smallest , but that 's okay because they were so damn good . they were perfect . the mission does a wonderful job of combining various latin cultures ' cuisine into a dish to make it their own . i got the chicken tacos , which sounds boring , but they were extraordinary . they are served with an aji amarillo sauce . aji is a common peruvian pepper , which has a wonderful and unique flavor , but i 've never seen it on tacos before , since tacos are n't part of peru 's cuisine . that 's what i love about this place -- they married the mexican and peruvian cultures and made something delightful out of the union . i ca n't wait for an opportunity to go back and try their arepas . the pabellon has my mouth watering already !		5		1
easley 's really is the best you can get in town . i have been to a number of shops , and you are wasting a ton of time at those places ... really you are ~ what to do ~ anytime year round you can stroll in here looking for any combination of costume-wear ... like wigs , accessories , actual costumes and rentals . ~ the good ~ this place is designed to be a one-stop shop , and believe me when i say they are just that . plus its local , how can you beat a well-run local retailer ? they have everything . i mean ... everything . i went as brick this year for h-ween , and great odens raven , they had a trident ! the hair product to change my hair black worked like a charm , and in previous years each time i needed a small item , they had exactly what i needed . its a treasure trove of awesomeness peeps . do not go to a cookie-cutter shop when you can find the costume you are looking for , and in many cases numerous versions of said costume . ~ the bad ~ because its so popular , things rarely run out ... but it will happen , this place is popular . so being popular , you have to come during non-peak times of the year to get what you want ... just come prepared and early for h-ween !! the parking lot is small , so that 's another negative come h-ween time . the staff are running everywhere during peak season , so do not expect amazing availability of reps. they also at times can be a bit short ... its not ultra-alarming , i 'll gauge this as i continue to shop here . i 'll update if it becomes a continuous issue . ~ the down low ~ this is the best shop in town , so no need to explain their rating , they get 5 stars across the board . no costume shop in the valley is year round and stocked as full as easley 's . come down for virtually anything and they 'll have it ... bank on it .		5		1
the salsa bar is `` all that and a bag of chips ! '' `` since when do you go to a salsa bar , where the salsas are actually really full of flavor , thick -lrb- not watered down -rrb- , and unique ?! '' as my friends put it so well ! it 's sounds strange , but the pecan salsa was delicious ! the peanut salsa was still spicy but had a hint of peanut in it , so it was n't overwhelmingly `` peanuty . '' there was a strawberry rhubarb pepper type of salsa . this may sound a little too strange for most , but it was almost like a spicy dessert type sauce . do n't forget to order some margaritas to wash those salsa and chips down . i would say you could get filled up on salsa , chips and margaritas alone here and be more than satisfied , but i 'm not sure the owners would be too happy about that ! the salsa variety was nothing less than astounding ! and do n't worry your precious little heart . there are traditional ones too : green tomatillo , chipotle red pepper , jicama , and cilantro ... just to name a few ! slow roasted cochinitas pibil -lrb- pork -rrb- tacos , slow cooked chicken mole tacos , beer battered dogfish shark tacos , battered shrimp tacos , el gaucho steak in chimchurri sauce tacos with guacamole . oh gawd , yes ! and affirmative ... these were all eaten in one sitting ... well , with a little help from bryan too . he 's so thoughtful for that too . i might have died from eating too much . we live so far from here that i just wanted to `` stock up , '' and i came oh so close to having to be rolled out of the place like that `` blueberry girl '' from charlie and the chocolate factory !		5		1
i do n't do sexy well . all of my attempts at seduction end in horrible awkwardness . drunk on sake from nobuo , i attempted to give my boyfriend the ol' bedroom eyes . he told me later that i acted like a mid-range call girl the entire evening . my bac was partially due to my empty stomach and patially due to previous alcohol consumption . we had already been waiting an hour and a half for pizzeria bianco and a bottle of wine later we decided to get some sustenance to help us through the next hour and a half of the wait . while i was n't making a spectacle of myself , we enjoyed the teeter tots and steamed pork buns . our waiter was an expert in the field of sake and helped us pair these two dishes with a great bottle of the stuff . the teeter tots , panko crusted tofu with a dipping sauce , were so good . i always look for a similar menu option at every japanese place we go to now , but nothing has come close . now , i admit i do not normally like steamed pork buns . but i was drunk and in the mood for adventure , so i gave these guys a shot ! second best outcome of an intoxicated decision ever ! get frisky at nubuo if you have the chance !		5		1
after a gracious gift of 2 free tickets from ipic after the tanzy yelp event , the wife and i are totally spoiled . we reserved our seats online and when we arrived to pick up our tickets , we knew this was n't your average movie theater . in a sense i feel guilty knowing i should be at the regular theater in my income bracket , but at the same time ... wow ... this must be how first class passengers feel on the plane ! we had 2 seats with no one on either side of us . the chairs were overstuffed and plush . they reclined . they had pillows . and a blanket ! a blanket ! popcorn came with our tickets and we did order food and drinks . the sweet potato fries were a huge hit with the wife and i. our server was so quiet and stealthy , we never saw him unless we got thirsty and magically he appeared ! we wanted to stay longer and watch the movie again in our comfy spots , but it was time to go back to reality . what a really cool movie experience .		5		1
this is my favorite restaurant in the metro phoenix area , a spot that has been operating for nearly three decades , and a friendly neighborhood bar where i love to take new faces . i rarely sit in the dining area of the restaurant . the tables that crowd the tiny space make the environment seem too cramped , and an intimate night out might be shared with the couple at the table next to you . sit at the bar , where you are always waited on promptly , the bar tenders are quite knowledgeable , have time to discuss the art of being alive , and can whip up some delectable treats before you receive your fare . my personal favorite beverage is the thai iced tea . though non-alcohlic , it is delicious and complements any of the foods well . ask the bartenders or servers about the wine list , often they carry imported beer from italy as well . i will start by saying i have not tasted everything on the menu , but i do know what i will order again and again . if you are new to thai food , an absolute must is the `` tom ka gai '' soup . a serving ideal for a party of three , it is a divine hot and sour interpretation with coconut milk , mushrooms , cilantro , lemongrass , galangal root , and kaffir lime . it can be ordered with any meats , tofu , or just plain . i recommend it with all white chicken , and at a number 2 . if you are unsure about how spicy you want your thai food , remember that 1 is not spicy , and 5 -lrb- the highest -rrb- will probably burn offyour taste buds . perhaps you like spicy , but also note that too much spice will overpower the complexity of your foods . if you want an assortment of various appetizers , try the combination plate which includes spring rolls , satay , -lrb- marinated chicken tenders with cucumber and peanut sauces , and my favorite ! -rrb- thai toast , -lrb- flash fried toast points filled with garlic and chicken , not my favorite -rrb- crab rangoon , -lrb- delicious flash-fried puffs of crab and cream cheese served with thai sauces -rrb- siamese kisses , -lrb- chicken and shrimp in steamed shumai wraps topped with scallions and crispy garlic -rrb- and potstickers . all come with an assortment of sauces , and if your eyes are larger than your belly , then you will likely have no room left for the divine main courses . quite frankly , i have never tried any of the house favorites , except the pad thai . and if pad thai is all you know , i recommend you venture out this time and wrap your lips around some of the sweetest , most delicious curries this side of the west i am not a fan of vegetables , which is something one finds an overabundance of in thai dishes ... but not if you order the `` burma gai . '' flat noodles and chicken in a yellow curry with coconut milk with titillate and tantalize . you can substitute , add , or remove anything in any one of the entrees , so you can basically customize your entrees . if you like something with a little more pizazz , do the `` drunken dragon noodles '' or `` the evil jungle princess . '' another curry dish , the dragon , has rice noodles smothered with a wild green curry sauce , topped with chicken , basil , and onion . again , if you are not a fan of the spicy , go very easy on this one . better yet is the princess , which has a lovely coconut sauce with hints of mint , and two simple additions of chicken and straw mushrooms . though i prefer chicken or nothing at all , the green basil curry with pork is another incredible curry with coconut and various veggies . you will also have a selection of seafood dishes , as well as specialty sushi rolls and vegetarian preparations . remember that the sauces here are the key , all dishes are served with rice , all ingredients can be removed or substituted , and if you really want to taste the diverse flavors , do n't make your dish too spicy . do n't be shy to ask , as all the waitstaff here is very knowledgable , and even if you are new to thai , or a veteran , they can assist you in making the perfect choice . should you have room for dessert at the end of your robust meal , a must is the traditional thai favorite , sticky coconut rice with fresh mangos . not heavy enough to warrant a wheelbarrow for the ride home , but sticky and sweet enough to make you feel like a kid again . in short , i love this place ! and i have to come here at least once a month just for the soup and the great conversation with the bartenders .		5		1
i have to say i 'm rather disappointed after my half hour + trek to chandler only to be served cold chinese food in a cavernous -lrb- and empty -rrb- retail location . i 'd read all the rave reviews about jade red chicken and was amped for some kick ass grub . three different people i know personally all told me i needed to check out cb as well and one of my buds , whose culinary curiosity is on par with mine , says he literally craves this stuff . i was pretty stoked to try something new tonite for dinner as we tend to get bogged down in central phoenix and eat at the same places over & over again . it 's friday nite , i 'd had a few beers after work and had a pretty light lunch , so i was beyond peckish and downright ready for the taste sensation i expected chino bandido to be . my better half and i drove from cenpho down to the culturally devoid center of the universe -lrb- aka chandler -rrb- , hungry and excited . we 'd read the reviews , used the interactive menu tool on the cb website and we were pumped for an excellent , if not quirky dinging experience . not . ; -lrb- the restaurant itself is in a bizarre , gravelly strip mall , oddly wedged between a nail salon and a store called simply `` wide shoes '' . we walked in to what felt like a vacant student union during spring break - - when everyone else is in ft. lauderdale , rocky point or the caribbean and you 're the only kid broke enough to stay on campus and work at your library job . there were maybe 25-30 other diners in the place but it is so huge inside that it felt empty and barren . we were greeted by a nice-enough counter lady who took our orders and punched them into the register . i felt somewhat robbed of the paper-menu ordering experience i 'd heard so much about -- no challenge , nothing unique . we grabbed our drinks , utensils and straws and settled in at the end of a loooong vacant rubbermaid folding table . jason asked why they had church buffet tables set up . i thought maybe there was something cool about them ... but nope ... just cheap tables . we looked around a bit while we waited for our food to come over and raised our eyebrows questioningly at one another . i kept waiting to `` get it '' -- which i figured we would when the food arrived . there were some screaming kids running around while their parents ignored them , chatted with one another and texted . -lrb- brats ! brats !! brats !!! get outta my yard !! ... i yelled inside my head like that mean old lady from down the block when i was a kid -rrb- . my annoyance with bad parenting aside -- i could n't figure out why everyone loved this place . it has all the ambiance of a med-clinic . i felt like at any minute a middle-aged woman in chili-pepper-embellished scrubs would shuffle over , hand me a clipboard with a flower-shaped pen , ask me to sign a release form and pay my co-pay . there was n't even muzak playing -- there was no music playing which made the place seem even more devoid of life . the food soon arrived and we dug in eagerly . everything was a smidge above room temp -- if that , and pretty boring to be frank . the jade red chicken is pretty comparable to panda express ' orange chicken . the bbq 'd pork did n't seem to have any asian bbq flavor -- more like roasted pork soaked in sugar and the cold , thick refried beans could have come from taco bell or a can . nothing unordinary or even interesting here . the only thing that was in the least bit interesting was the pork fried rice which tasted oddly like it 'd been cooked with cheap white sherry and shallots -- which i 've not experienced before with fried rice . that was `` atypical '' but certainly not interesting or enchanting . the only redeeming thing about the meal was the snickerdoodle which seemed oddly out of place for either mexican or asian food . it was pretty good though . even though i was physically full after the meal i felt very emotionally empty , oddly depressed about chandler , its environs and its residents . everyone else in the joint seemed oddly devoid of emotion as -- certainloy not like people who go out to dinner on a friday evening . i 'm thinking we should have aimed the car towards the original chino bandido in the aves . i am a fan of asian and latin foods and admittedly have an odd penchant for cheap asian buffets -- so i 'm usually pretty tolerant of cheap bad fried foods . i 'm thinking that the original divey joint did n't translate well to chandler , so i 'm willing to give cb another try -- just never again in the east valley . please someone explain to me what i 'm missing here .		2		0
scale of 1-10 -lrb- multiple visits -rrb- : 6 food 5 * drinks * 5 service 8 atmosphere 5 value it 's not bad , but it 's also not good . the drinks are severely underwhelming and the food does n't taste nearly as good as the high prices & small portion sizes would suggest . the service is consistently stiff and/or poorly timed . about all i particularly like is the awesome patio . there are just too many other awesome options downtown to spend your $ and calories here .		2		0
chino bandido , you robbed me of a good lunch ! this place came highly recommended by some of my peers before i moved down here . the concept is very cool , but i think the execution just is n't there . the idea of combining mexican and chinese foods intrigued me , but when my food arrived , it came in a aluminum to go container , looking like food i had n't finished from the night before that i reheated . it was also unceremoniously dropped off in front of us , they seemed it bit unorganized . as for the taste , i give it a big meh . not bad , not good . the fried rice was n't very good , but the gringo chicken was tasty . the carnitas was a bit too shredded , it lacked texture and was similar to ground pork . i might think about giving it another shot , but my coworkers have deemed this place `` off the list ... ''		2		0
had high expectations for the lounge of the hotel san marcos , stopped by out of curiosity on urban wine walk . while initially was happy to stumble upon a rather throwback gem , impression quickly waned both with the bar 's ill-planned choice of serving out of plastic cups , jarringly incongruent with the hotel 's monaco feel , and the wines being barely drinkable . took us all but 10 minutes to make our exit .		2		0
ever go to one of those places where the service is so bad it puts a damper on the whole experience ? after we were seated we were informed they were out of pork belly . that was a bummer because i love pork belly . i do n't have a problem with a place running out of an item , as i like stuff that 's fresh . we were then informed of the specials , and immediately tako dumplings made me forget about the pork belly . the waitress gave us some time to look over the menu and mentioned it 's family style . a few minutes later the waitress returned and said `` okay we have your items ordered and let me know if you want anything else '' . when i explained that we actually never ordered yet she left and came back a couple minutes later . `` that 's right you have n't ordered '' . we proceeded to order the tako dumplings and a few other items . we explained that we 've never been here before so we 'd like to order a couple of things now and then see how the portions go . the waitress explained that people usually order 4 dishes per person and if i did n't order them all at once they could n't control the timing of the dishes . so we picked the rest of our items . a few minutes later the waitress returns to say `` we are out of tako '' . i asked how they could be out of the dinner special when dinner rush has just started . `` well it 's been on the board all day but when i ordered it they said we did n't have any '' . yep this is a finely tuned restaurant where they ca n't be bothered to remove an item from `` the board '' . one of the dishes we ordered was a shiromi carpaccio which came with focaccia . the dish had a nicely heated sesame seed oil with garlic - very tasty and perfect for dipping . if we actually had the focaccia it would have been great for dipping . 10 minutes later out comes the focaccia . nice controlled timing of the dishes . the food here is pretty good . some items such as the kimchi with dried shrimp are very tasty . others such as the soft shell crab salad are nice ingredients but seem thrown together in a disjointed fashion . overall it 's a quaint little place with pretty good dishes but you can go elsewhere and easily have a better dining experience .		2		0
over priced and kinda `` i do n't care for you '' service . ordered the specials which was `` banh canh '' and it was okay . broth was good , good portion but just a few pieces of meat . i gave this place a second try for another dish and probably would not come back . i have experieced better authentic food at other places .		2		0
service 4 food 2 cleanliness 3 atmosphere 3 value 3 pros : great beans fresh tasting guacamole large drinks cons : parking lot exit dangerous to large vehicles health slowish service less then stellar food dishes worth the calories : salsa red/green beans guacamole full review : this is one of those times when `` meh . i 've experienced better '' fits perfectly . i was so excited to come eat here : -lrb- like los compadres it had been on the list for a long time . a 4 star mexican place with very few bad reviews seemed like a safe bet . this place also showed up on chow bella a few days ago . i was prepared for another kick ass meal but figured i was in for meh service based on what i read . seems like i received the complete 180 of an experience . got there about 7:30 saturday night . the place was 65 % capacity at most . this surprised the heck out of me considering the time/reviews and recent writeup . figured i was doomed for a night of waiting . we were at out table within 2 minutes and the waitress was there to take our drink order and drop off salsa in less then 5 . she quickly returned with some huge glasses of water an a basket of chips . i was ready for these amazing hot from the fryer chips i had read so much about . what i got instead was room temp chips of which 1/2 had a nice freshly dipped in grease then cooled coat on them . i 'm a good sport so i tried one of the greasy ones and all i could taste was room temp oil from a fryer that needed fresh oil in a bad bad way . . blech : -lrb- the salsa however was very tasty . the red was far from burning hot that i had read so much about . it was warm but far from spicy and was one of the best things i would eat all evening . the green was also very flavorful and masked the gross chips well . we ordered a huge pile of food including a cheese crisp and guacamole which hit the table quickly . we were then in for a good 20 minute wait before the rest of the food showed up . food details : guacamole : very simple prep here . avocado , onion , salt and 800lbs of tomatoes . i absolutely hate fresh tomatoes but that 's just a personal preference . the quac was fresh and tasty . there was nothing `` wrong '' with it there 's just much better at countless places . rice : so far from exciting i do n't specifically recall . i just remember having a bite and moving on . was a little greasy and bland : / beans : just went i thought dinner was a complete waste i took a few bites of these and wow ! some of the best beans i 've ever had . pretty sure there is a huge amount of lard but who cares . the texture was perfect . . the flavor was perfect . . i could have been satisfied with a side of quac , couple tortillas and a huge bowl of beans . half of it was smashed/creamed and the other was whole beans . i 'm not even a bean person and it was the only part of my plate that had been scrapped clean . cheese crisp : no real crisp at all . just a tortilla with melted cheese and a major pool of grease . green chili tamale : the texture was very rubbery but it was at least spicy . this was another `` not bad but far from great '' items . ground beef taco : the shell was nice and crispy and did n't taco fail . the meat inside was this super fine texture but did not have a lot of flavor . chili relleno : oh man . . i 've been trying to figure this one out . terrible is the only word i have for it . there were two of them on the table and they were both the same . the batter was literally water logged and there was nothing on the plate to do that . they were n't greasy . . they were watery . i 'm nearly positive these were made in house , frozen , and heated to order . there 's no other way they could get a spongy soggy texture like that any other way . enchilada : suffered from more cheese on top of my enchilada then inside of it and a serious lack of red sauce . do n't get me wrong . . i like cheese but it was 10 % red sauce and 90 % cheese . i could n't even really taste the red sauce to see if it was any good . the enchilada was a corn tortilla with a sprinkle of cheese on the inside . it was literally flat on the plate like someone folded it then smashed it down that 's how skimpy the filling was . red sauce : do n't know . . there was not enough of it on anything to actually taste it . could this have been an off night ? i guess its possible but i order so much variety that it pretty much rules out having a bad experience because a single item was n't good that night . is this the worst mexican in town ? far from it . . but there are so many other great places i feel sorry for anyone who might call this their only mexican stop when they have a craving . they are missing out on some real good food out there .		2		0
i 've frequented teakwoods for the past 10 years . and this place has changed for the worse . it used to be a trendy ski-lodge wisconsin-colorado bar with cute and friendly waitresses . the crowd used to be a young educated crowd who would come here for drinks before venturing out to scottsdale or tempe . now , it almost feels like a glorified applebees . the crowd has gotten older . you see a lot of good ole boys and meatheads eat here . the waitresses transformed from being fun and cute girls that you would see in a trendy tempe bar to homely girls who do n't smile and seem to hate their life . whatever was fun and charming about this place has been lost . do n't worry , teakwoods will always be busy because the applebees crowd is going to continue to flock to this place because the food and prices are excellent . however , the service and vibe has taken a major hit . i would recommend zipps or payton 's place before teakwoods . in terms of watching sports , this is n't a great place . not all of the tv 's are flat screens and nearly all the tv 's in that side room have old school tv 's with bad reception . they also do n't have common sense in regards to programming . for example , they had the nerve to have soccer playing on several of the tv 's during march madness .		2		0
hmm . . perhaps i 'm rating so low because i was so amped to go to this place since i live in tempe , love comedy , and love improv . i mean , i was really excited . me , my boyfriend , his friend , and my roommate went a few weeks ago to see ... hmm . . do n't really remember her name . she was n't that great - perhaps one of the reasons of my distaste for the tempe improv . either way , it was really annoying . when you get there before the show you have two options , stand outside in line , where all the smokers gab and obnoxiously flick their cigarette ashes carelessly ... or inside the `` waiting area-with a two drink minimum '' . the `` bouncer '' outside did n't really have a personality and was rude when explaining that to us . strike 1 . since i 'm a non-smoker , i opted to not have the disgusting scent of ciggs on my cute outfit . we headed inside , all grabbed a seat , and chatted ... eagerly awaiting the opening of the theater . we waited there for about 20 minutes , not once being approached by a server for our drink orders . strike 2 . finally , the cue was given and everyone rushed through the doors . there were ushers whom sat everyone according to party size . we sat at a long table , pretty close to the front . the chairs were very close together and a foot behind me was another party . we were all crammed in there . forcefully packed like sardines . strike 3 . i was already convinced by this point that i was n't going to come back , but i did n't let that ruin my night . i laughed at the opening acts , ordered some ridiculously over priced beverages and attempted to enjoy the show . once the main comedian hit the stage it was getting really warm from all the bodies inches from mine . i requested water and was brought a 16oz glass bottle of evian ... for $ 6 . awesome . ugh , i 've had better . i 'll only be going to the comedy spot in scottsdale , which despite its location , is more down to earth , breezy , comfortable , and fair priced than this . tempe improv is a joke ... literally .		2		0
based on the fact that the wait was a bit over half and hour and the savory crepe order we chose i would give crêpe bar 2.5 stars the .5 is due to the complimentary banana bread offering from the chef for the wait . we really should have tried the sweet crepe options as this breakfast burrito disappointed in too many ways . texture was poor and sloppy from the excess liquid of the pick sauce , egg and guac filling . and cheese overload that reminded me more of a soggy grilled cheese . i also prefer my crepes super thin . we did n't finish more than two or three bites and left . perhaps we 'll return to try the sweet but not sure if i 'd really drive the 40 mile round trip again .		2		0
so sad when you have a bad experience but i hope it 's the only time because we liked this place . the food can be marginal ... but what i hate is bad service . we must have gotten a trainee , which is fine , but attitude is everything . i do n't berate , complain , or otherwise be rude to my patients -lrb- not to their face anyway -rrb- . it 's bad work ethic and i 'm providing a service to make them feel better and to let them know i care ... ugh ... our waitress kept rushing us all night ... taking away the chips too soon , constantly pushing the bill on us `` have you paid , have you paid , have you paid '' ... enough ! for christs sake , it 's not even that busy right now , relax ! could n't get our bill right either . as for the food this night ... cold and slightly stale tortillas ... the stuffed quesadilla was absolutely flavorless and way too cheesy/greasy ... yikes . better luck next time !		2		0
i ordered the spicy pork . the flavor of the sauce was good and the meat was cooked well , but it was also very stringy and fatty . overall , the food was mediocre . the food prices are too high for the quality offered . however , the portion sizes are quite large , so there should be leftovers for extra meals . our service was terrible . the servers would not look in our direction for 20 minutes at a time . they did not once visit during the meal . they brought two dishes out 10 minutes before the others and brought one person 's food out 15 minutes after everyone else had their food . we had trouble paying , since they would ignore us and wipe down an adjacent empty table even though we were clearly waving and yelling to them . the combination of terrible service , average food , and high prices ensures that i will not return .		2		0
i had heard that this was a cool bar to people watch and the food was delicious . so we decided to go on a saturday for a late dinner . we got there at 9:30 pm and there was still a 45 minute wait . we did n't realize that people stayed after dinner for easton ashe so the table availability was limited . the service was awful from the hostess to the server , except the bouncer . we had to ask the waiter for everything . the server that dropped off our food practically yelled at us and was super rude . the crowd was mixed and odd . i ca n't even describe it . my seared tuna sandwich was overpowered by the black pepper/salt rub and the cabbage slaw was boring . the beet salad was okay . there was a lot of mixed greens and one beet and they forgot the dressing . the one redeeming factor was the prime dip sandwich which was quite tasty although it was a little grisly for my preference . i am not sure if i want to revisit this establishment in the near future .		2		0
good ice cream , but nothing spectacular . had the brownie swirl , which had good taste but felt like it was missing something to make it special . good service as well .		2		0
i had lunch here with fellow yelpers robyn n. , masha z. , norm r. , arlin b. , georgie m and rand h. well to start we had some bread brought to are table which was very good but was all gone by the time i got my chicken & mushroom cannolloni.they should have offered more bread when everyone one got there pasta or soup . -lrb- minus a star -rrb- food was not hot enough -lrb- oops there goes another one -rrb- service when we were done was very slow and i was still hungry -lrb- down to 2 stars -rrb- i will stop writing before they run out of stars . -lrb- will not return -rrb- .		2		0
atmosphere is great . service was good . the food left much to be desired . the margarita chicken was dry and had little flavor . the ribs were worse . the texture was strange and they were tasteless . i was really disappointed since the atmosphere is so neat .		2		0
i 'm kind of glad we went here spontaneously without reading any other yelp reviews . we wanted to love this place , but ultimately were disappointed . it so was close to being great but fell short . first of all , it seems like a real misstep for a wine bar to not have some sweet wine on their menu . i pretty much only like moscato , and for them not to have any was disappointing . hubby had a glass of prosecco that was pretty good , but too dry for my taste . secondly , the service was mediocre at best . there was a large party on the patio when we arrived so we were seated inside -lrb- not a problem -rrb- . the host seated us and the waiter came by a few minutes later to ask about drinks . i asked about moscato , was told there were n't any and said we needed more time . we did n't talk to him again for about another 15 minutes , despite hubby trying to make eye contact . when we did get the waiter back we ordered wine , but he did n't ask for food orders and was gone before we could say something . the waiter came a few minutes later , dropped off the glass of wine and walked away without a word , even though we were ready to order . about 10 minutes later a lady -lrb- manager ? -rrb- came and asked if we had been helped . when we told her we had been waiting to order food she took our order on the spot . we also seemed to get a new waitress . she was more attentive but not very friendly . as for the food , well it was all missing ... something . we had the bruschetta . the fig and proscuitto version really would have benefited from a drizzle of balsamic vinegar - something a little acidic to cut all of the heaviness of the cheese . the hummus bruschetta was simply a schmear of hummus sprinkled with some chopped chives - definitely uninspiring . the calamari was bland and overcooked to the point of being rubbery . they ended up comping that on the bill when i complained . the house fries were good , but really that should have been the easiest thing to get right . even so , i was hoping for more of the lemon , garlic and parmesan flavor and these just tasted like fries with some chives and parsley . the garlic aioli that came with them was great though . for what we paid for this -lrb- $ 21 before tip for 2 apps and a glass of wine -rrb- , i expected better .		2		0
i 'm always on the search for sushi that costs under $ 10 a person at lunch . that is probably asking for too much . anyway , for $ 20 two of us got the salmon and yellowtail sushi , and the philadelphia and shrimp rolls . the sushi was n't bad , but the shrimp roll was terrible . i was still a little hungry after but did n't want to pay for another mediocre roll . if you love sushi i would not recommend going here .		2		0
overrated . i got one of the `` supreme '' hotdogs or whatever which was a dollar more -lrb- $ 9.50 ish -rrb- . it sounded good , brat cooked in beer , covered with saurkraut and bacon . the brat was as big as a pointer finger and the pretzel bun was slightly larger than a dinner roll . so picture pig in blanket with much larger roll and a pig that 's just a little bigger . not proportional , and kind of messy - people get this off a truck and are able to eat it without a fork and knife ?? the pita bread with pimento cheese was actually very good , however , the bread was so greasy . we were thinking we should go back for this and beer , but realized its probably not a great idea . maybe the dogs off the truck are a little bigger ? it would definitely have to be several dollars cheaper for this to work . . the beer selection was pretty good though and value priced .		2		0
i have come here quite a few times with friends who love hot wings . i am not a hot wing person , but the menu is enormous and lots to choose from . i have never been disappointed with the food ... it is your typical bar food pizza , burgers , sliders , sandwiches , and many other things . my only complaint is we sat on the patio and it smelled like a sewer out there . i do n't recall this being a issue before ... so not sure if this is a problem that can be resolved or only going to get worse . my suggestion ... if you are going there and want to sit on the patio ... sit as far to the east as possible . it did n't smell as much over there : -rrb-		2		0
i think this restaurant is overpriced . i recommend ordering from the ala carte menu . the chips are good -lrb- and thin ; i like thin chips -rrb- . the guacamole was bad . i think sour cream is used as a `` filler . '' however , the meal that i ordered -lrb- a simple taco with beans/rice -rrb- was good . nothing stands out as far as i am concerned though ...		2		0
i like pretty much any shopping opportunity , but this collection of outlets intermixed with a few ` regular ' stores , cell-phone and lotion kiosks , was just ... depressing . with a few exceptions , a majority of the retailers seemed to sell very similar merchandise -lrb- i counted 5 shops selling baseball caps -rrb- or things that were just plain strange -lrb- a chain-mail suit !? -rrb- . i suppose that would be great if you wanted one for an upcoming renaissance faire . i am sure there were amazing deals to be had , but they simply eluded me . maybe i was n't in the right frame of mind to dig through mountains of merchandise . i may return when i am feeling more ` adventurous ' . i add a star because it had a/c and my friend did find a very good deal on t-shirts . otherwise ...		2		0
bland , uninspired , boring and dark . great happy hour spot . do n't miss spicy mary . -- light provided by a cluster of 4 low-watt street-lamp-style globes and candles goes for a sidewalk cafe , but it was just too dark . -- chicken gumbo uninteresting -- red beans and rice , no flavor -- jumbalaya a mound of bland rice with flecks of meat -- sausage very authentic with ground spicy bits of hooves and snouts , except i can still feel those bits , ew ! -- crawdads are the only palatable dish , though it 's not far from a chinese all-you-can-eat buffet . -- spicy mary made with absolut peppar and marinated asparagus . do n't miss it . -- live low slow blues guitar and jazz styles missing the energy i wanted -- food also missing a kind of mischief i expect from this cuisine ; i have to douse everything with tabasco . baby kay 's is a phoenix stalward , having survived for at least 15 years , but probably longer . am missing something ? is southern cooking just not interesting ? i think not . i 'll hav to pull out my old vcr tapes of that heavy french accent narrating best chefs of the world .		2		0
i struggle between two and three stars ... but the d bag count dropped them a star . sure ca n't blame the place , but i can decide i do n't want to go based on the clientele , and let 's face it , this place is arcadia d bag/drunk frat/wanna be central . so , 2 stars . on a quiet night or lazy afternoon , it 's not so bad and the vig rig is a great idea -lrb- more places should take the idea and run with it -rrb- . but , on a busy night , ugh , save me . also , not so bad if you can get a booth and watch the sights , which is usually jaw dropping ridiculous . do people know that trying to be cool , is not cool ? just chill brah ! that woman could care less about your tribal arm band ... but trust me , you can find someone here who does care . food is so so . simple done well is better than unique done ok ... and the vig tends to lean towards the unique side . service ranges from good to ok . but , sorry , the drunk d 's playing bocce and talking at a volume so that they can be heard at chelsea 's kitchen ... yeah , costing em stars .		2		0
07/20/11 2.75 stars . was shopping for tamarind candy and pan de sal at lee lee 's , whiling away time before i was to meet an aunt at mekong plaza to dine at one -lrb- or two -rrb- of the food kiosks there , when i received a text from her saying she 'd been in an accident . dropping everything , i met her at the scene . an hour and a half later -lrb- she 's not hurt , and the other driver was ticketed -rrb- , i was starving for nourishment and aunt was not , so we headed back to the lee lee plaza to wait for her ride . i was craving for noodles and was heading to pho van , when we walked by phoenix palace and decided i 'd give it another try , as aunt gave it a green light , and i remembered from reading `` recent '' reviews that it was under `` new '' management . -lrb- last time i visited was two years ago . -rrb- a child host greeted and sat us at a booth . -lrb- ok , she 's asian , so she probably was 13 years old ... i know how it is ... when i was 18 , people thought i was 12 , and now i 'm ... well , let 's just get back to the review , shall we ? -rrb- we both ordered water , and i studied the menu . after about ten minutes , the server that kept walking by our table finally approached to ask if i we were ready to order . i asked if the bbq pork lo mein came w / vegetables . he said that the chow mein had mushrooms , but the lo mein would not have any veggies . `` no veggies ? , '' i asked . can you add some ? he said , after some thought , `` bok choy , '' and i said yes . i also asked if broccoli and snow peas can be added . he said ok . `` no celery , or carrots , ok ? '' he nodded yes . i also ordered a batch of crab puffs . the crab puffs arrived 15 minutes later , all golden-brown and smelled wonderful . i liked the crunch of the fresh-from-the-fryer wonton wraps , but found that the sweetened cream cheese and crab filling too sweet . i decided to eat a couple before the entree and save the rest for dessert . -lrb- i found that i enjoyed the crab puffs more when i thought of it as a dessert , and not as an appetizer . -rrb- the lo mein arrived four minutes after -lrb- 19 minutes after time of order -rrb- , looking delicious , but definitely cooked w / carrots . i did n't complain and let the matter drop . i 'd only expected bok choy , broccoli , and snow peas ; instead , i saw bok choy , carrots , cabbage , bean sprouts , spring onions , and garlic ! the exclusion of broccoli was a-ok - i had n't really wanted it in there ; i just did n't want `` just bok choy . '' the dish was very good ! loved the sauce that it was sauteed in , though the bbq pork was a little too fatty for my taste - i worked around it . what i really did n't enjoy were the pieces of bitter bok choy . some were sweet , and after finding two bitter chunks , i thought i 'd see if there was a reason why they were bitter . a-ha ! those that were bitter were bites close to bases of the stalks , which had particles that looked like dirt , while those that tasted sweet were cubed pieces , or stalks that did n't contain those dirt-like particles -lrb- see photos -rrb- . needless to say , i felt less-enthused about the noodles after that . back to those crab puffs ! server was unobtrusive , but could be found , if i needed him . the woman who gave me the ticket and my fortune cookie was very sweet ... ok , phoenix palace . one more strike in a few months , or maybe two years , and you 're out ! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnqsjfrm09t-vojrtaf66g?select=ygt_oec7k_ukeglfdmwpow http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnqsjfrm09t-vojrtaf66g?select=f7ci-_b6cb0bzg3qgvzhyg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnqsjfrm09t-vojrtaf66g?select=phzjqhzvrwbhmsxwv5aydg		2		0
people do n't usually come to this downtown scottsdale night spot to eat . the food is n't anything to call home about and the margaritas are n't spectacular . infact , the bartenders tend to pour them weak . however , you will find the party people at the pt . they come to see-and-be-seen . and the bar is slammed with them on tuesday nights when promoter brian durkee hosts twisted tuesdays . you 'll find guys with popped collars wearing sunglasses at night and peroxide blondes with stiletto heels and cleavage-baring tops . if you 're into a scene , this is probably the place for you .		2		0
right off the bat , the told me `` no , you cant sit at the outside bar , it 's closed '' ... okay . . i 'll sit at the inside one . there where only 51 beers on tap , and i have tried all of them numerous times . nothing special . not one . nothing special about the menu either , i ordered 2 apps for myself . . the seared ahi , and some potato cakes . . both came with this napa slaw , that was great with the ahi , but not to great with the cakes . . if you want a pricey beer that you can find anywhere , and an unimaginative menu doused in napa slaw , this is the spot ... and do n't you dare try to sit at the outside bar , ever .		2		0

i do n't know where to begin , i was born in california , lived in chicago for 15 years both of those locales had better mexican food . now after living in arizona for the last year trying some restaurants and take away spots . what is the deal mexican food here so close to the border yet the flavor and colors of this food do n't illustrate any thing but drab and boring . pureed guacamole is not what i was expecting when i ordered it to accompany my combo grande of chile rellano and chicken enchilada , do not order the fideo way too soupy and it taste like watered down spaghetti o 's not good . i love mexican food but i wo n't be back here to have it .		2		0
another jewel in the fox crown-read amazing look and feel but outrageous prices for food that 's really nothing special . a few of us went to lunch the other day and one of my buddies orders the prime rib french dip . the server asks if they would like mushrooms , peppers or onions to which my friend replied yes , please . they were kind enough to charge $ 2 each for said add-ons so $ 6 total additional charge . i mean seriously , i can get ten pounds of onions for two dollars ... i ended up splitting a chicken club and a ~ 1 oz . cheese ` plate ' with a friend and we both got iced tea . $ 24 ... to top it off the waiter was kind of a dick . i probably would never patronize a fox restaurant again if i did n't get hooked up with gift cards on occasion .		2		0

i never knew i was an ice cream snob , until this evening . i had such high hopes for this place . i love diners . i love ice cream . perfect location -lrb- well , almost perfect , for me -rrb- . number one in phoenix-yelp ice cream . how can this go wrong ? well , unfortunately , the ice cream just did n't cut muster . i mean , i 'm sure its not the worst i 've ever tasted . -lrb- but , i am struggling to think of worse ice cream . -rrb- there 's just something that 's off and i ca n't pinpoint it . maybe they were just having a bad night . or maybe i ordered incorrectly ...		2		0
holy . over . priced . i stopped by to get a little bag of silly candy for a friend 's birthday . i ended up throwing in a goofy post-it note pad , but holy crap , $ 45 !? i almost passed out . do n't think i 'll be back ...		2		0
food was alright . service was the worst i have ever experienced . i took almost two hours for us to receive our food . i have n't and will not go back . thai hut is much better/cheaper/better service !!		2		0
first off nothing gourmet going on here at all . its basically subway with free delivery and they have to deliver it for free or there is no way in hell you would bother with the place . it 's cheap , generic , flavorless food .		2		0
so i fly on average twice a month . i 'll start off by saying that it 's all about which terminal you use . if you 're travelling southwest or us airways , you will unfortunately have to use terminal 4 . while it is the new and largest terminal , it is also the busiest ... by far !!!!! i can never accurately predict how busy it will be . on any random friday , i can expect a long , slow security line-especially when i 'm running late . i still fail to understand how they will only man 2 of the 3 i.d check stations when the lines are long ... . and do n't get me started on the security and x-ray stations . i got to experience the awesome new airport in singapore and thinking about while in line at terminal 4 at sky harbor almost makes me cry every time . where this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks . this is where terminal 4 shines . they close early though , so if you 're leaving after 8:00 pm , forget about a drink , pizza slut or cinnabon . terminal 2 is quite the opposite-fast and easy to check-in and get past security . it is a breeze and about as stress free as you can get in the u.s. . the flip side is that there is one bar and it is lame . so there is absolutely nothing to do with the spare time you have , having anticipated that security was going to take forever after experiencing terminal 4 . so to sum up , terminal 4 has lots of bars and food venues that you wo n't be able to experience because it took so long to get through security . and as stressed as you are after security , it really sucks because you 'll need a drink-but your flight 's leaving in 6 minutes . you will probably be relaxed with time to kill if you use terminal 2 , but how you kill that time is going to be problematic .		2		0
another run-of-the mill americanized thai restaurant that seems to be the norm around az . . rubbery meats , american broccoli , boring carrots and zucchini . no spice factor , few herbs and fish sauces , no authentic dishes , or dishes done authentically . where 's the roasted duck red curry , larb salads , asian/thai vegetables , whole-fried fish , papaya salad with blue crab ? oh , i forgot i 'm in central phoenix . geeze , i 'm such a food snob . if ya 'll think this is good , your mouth will melt when you get the real stuff . on the plus side , it 's a nice , small restaurant and was very busy at lunch . to-go orders do n't get the house salad they serve but you do get a little eggroll wrapped in foil . my search for true phoenician thai food with bold , complex flavors continues . any leads would be greatly appreciated .		2		0
i had heard of miracle mile and used to work near the one on camelback but had never ate here until some co-workers invited my husband and me to lunch . let 's just say there 's a reason why i had n't ate here previously and it 's because the food is just mediocre . there are way too many items to choose from and i think that makes it hard to perfect the food being served . i think if they narrowed down the menu , the food would be better . also , being a deli , i would expect amazing sandwiches . instead , they have mediocre sandwiches , burgers , hot dogs , salads , and entrees like lasagna , stuffed cabbage , meatloaf , and baked fish . it really feels more like a cafeteria than a deli . upon arrival , you have to wait in line - cafeteria style . i 'm not real big on this as i feel rushed and it reminds me of high school cafeteria dining . it was really hard to narrow down what i wanted to eat and honestly i ca n't even remember because it was n't that spectacular . -lrb- i know i ordered my sandwich on wheat bread , which was just average . -rrb- i also ordered fries with my sandwich . i always think it 's hit or miss with fries and this was a miss in my book . they were thick , but not steak fries . so they were n't too crunchy and a little too soft . also , they really needed some salt or any other spice . both my husband and two co-workers ordered hot sandwiches - the pastrami and corned beef . the co-workers enjoyed their meals , but they were the reason why we stopped here to begin with . my husband thought his sandwich was okay , but again , nothing spectacular . if the co-workers invited us to go back , i 'd have to politely decline . this place was n't really what i was expecting and i 'm not real into cafeteria style dining . obviously other people are , as the place was packed . maybe they know something i do n't ?		2		0
been here twice and probably wo n't go back , unless i only have margaritas . the food was great the first time and very sub-par the second , especially for the price of the tacos . the pork ones were especially gross ; extremely greasy and fatty and tasteless -lrb- i know pork is fatty , but it should n't be hard to chew -rrb- . our service was good the first go round , as we sat at the bar and learned a lot from the bartender about their tequilas . the second time , service was no good . very slow and our waters went empty for entire meal , even after we asked for more . they do have great guac and chips and their margaritas are fantastic , and they should be for what you pay . but if you are looking for great tacos , skip this place . you 'll be underwhelmed .		2		0
big problem when you have a restaurant called native new yorker and your manager on duty that night is sporting a full-on tattoo of fenway park . new yorkers and bostonians do not mix and i know many ny people who wo n't patronize any places owned or operated by scummy red sox fans . thought i was safe at a place with ny in it 's moniker , but apparently at nny , they allow managers with large exposed tattoos to work there and flaunt the fact openly . `` i wear it proudly '' he said . well , dude wear a long sleeve shirt and wear it proud when your out of a new york restaurant . kudos to the $ 10 free birthday coupon which got me some good chicken strippers with mandarin orange sauce -lrb- mild kick -rrb- and good steak fries and fresh slaw . bartender was nice guy too and manager was normal when i asked about the irony of his tattoo , but it needs to be covered at all times while he is there . let 's go yankees .		2		0
this bar is has country western decor around , it 's a outdoorsy place , really good for a smokers i 'm not a fan but if you are smoker it 's the bar for you love the decorations , was n't too busy when i was there as i drove by later that evening and was a lot more people and seems to be more of a place for the locals .		2		0
why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me ? parking is freaking ridiculous , at least i have been enough times to know to leave my car on mill and walk . your security people are a bunch of freaking jerks who take their power wayyyy to seriously - take off my shoes ? what kind of weapon or drugs can i be hiding in my open toed 2 inch heels ? your sound sucks - seriously sucks . for all the fees you charge on top of tickets - buy some new speakers already . the bathrooms are gross drinks are reasonable so you get 2 stars -lrb- watch out for the glass walls leading to the patio if you have overindulged in booze . . i 've heard they are easy to run in to -rrb- .		2		0

seems there are only 2 ethiopian restaurants in tempe and i 've now officially been to both . unfortunately , lalibela will have to settle for being 2nd best . i cam here with my girlfriend for valentine 's day last week . it was our first time to lalibela , but we 're no strangers to ethiopian food . so , we made reservations , were quickly brought to our table and everything was swell . they offered a valentine 's day menu , so we ordered the vegetarian special . it was about $ 36 and was allegedly a meal for two . odd , because on their regular menu they have a meal for 3 at $ 38 . in retrospect , we probably should have paid the extra $ 2 and taken home more leftovers . more bang for your buck . either way , it 's a pretty steep price for ethiopian food . most of which is very cheap to make as our meal was mostly peas , lentils , potatoes , salad and cabbage . we also got a bottle of yellow tail merlot @ ~ $ 18 . both our food and our wine came out very quickly . and that was pretty much the last time we saw our server for the rest of the meal . i will hand it to lalibela , the food is good . very good . perhaps even better than blue nile . but the price is steep and the lack of service really spoiled the night for us . it 's not as if the place was busy . by the time our meal was finished there was only 3 other tables with patrons at them but none of them were receiving any service . sure , we knew there were waitresses . we could hear them talking in the kitchen so they must exist ! after maybe 15-20 minutes of sitting waiting on our check , empty water and no service to speak of i actually had go up to the front desk and wave down our waitress . this is completely unacceptable for any restaurant . short of an emergency , there is no reason why a dining room should be left unattended for 15 minutes while there are guests . my feeling was that the servers got their food out and that 's all that mattered . no `` how 's the food ? '' no refills on waters . nothing . on top of that , lalibela 's menu lacks the diversity of blue nile . not only does blue nile have great veg options , but they have sambusas , hummus , falafel , salads and a raw vegan menu . lalibela just has about a dozen or so meat and vegetable dishes . likely all that could be found at blue nile for a much lower price . i can understand why people come here . the food is good -lrb- the injera is certainly better than blue nile 's -rrb- , but the lack of service and the price are enough to keep me out of lalibela for good .		2		0
take a group and go late . there are two key issues that present hurdles to having an all around good time at dave and busters . the first issue is the food is terribly overpriced and the quality was not impressive as i have found it to be greasy at times or overcooked . the second issue revolves around the bloody ankle biters , why you would want to drag your kids to a bar is far beyond me -lrb- i do however see why having kids can make you want to drink heavily -rrb- so the only obvious circumvention is to go later in the evening to avoid the annoyance . the variety of arcade games is not bad . they have several group play racing and trivia games but they are missing some staple crowd pleasing games like air hockey and strangely absent are the fighting style games -lrb- tekken , street fighter , mortal combat , etc. -rrb- . in a nutshell go later in the evening with a group for the games and stick to a simple faire of bar food or you might find yourself sorely disappointed . tempe market place is a great place to wonder around in this time of year -lrb- spring -rrb- with a variety of restaurants , shops , etc. . dave and busters is worth spending an hour or two in but if you want decent food i would look elsewhere .		2		0
we had the angus sliders , grilled cheese sandwich and buffalo chicken sandwich . they all came with bacon on them - good quality and thick sliced but overcooked . we drowned the sliders with ketchup to try to get some moisture and seasoning into them . . the buffalo chicken sandwich was ok , but sloppy and somehow bland as well . the grilled cheese had 2 very mild cheeses in it so again pretty mild . the sweet potato tots and the regular fries were both underdone and not crispy at all , and someone forgot to sprinkle some salt on these . so somehow we ended up with a very bland meal that had a lot of salt -lrb- probably from the bacon -rrb- . not a fan at all of the food !! maybe its just a place for drinking ?		2		0
yuck ! ick ! ewwwww ! would be how i 'd describe my lunch at sun asian kitchen . whatever was served was albeit presentable but in terms of taste not good at all . i ordered the wonton soup and the honey chicken combo -lrb- comes with a chicken eggroll , and choice of fried rice , steamed rice or lo mein , brown rice is extra -rrb- . the wonton soup had a weird taste to it , the broth was alright and the vegetables included in the soup canned . the honey chicken combo arrived shortly after , and it looked promising . and what goodness it seemed to offer ended after the first bite . i know how to cook fried rice , and yes , fried rice is made with day old rice but what i had was the rice at the bottom of the pan , there were hard bits to it that would stick to my teeth and there was no flavor to it , as for flavor , the honey chicken had nothing close to it being honey chicken , and the dish tasted off . it was a mess . i was hoping to at least enjoy the chicken minus the lackluster fried rice but the fried pieces of chicken was mostly batter and less chicken . and the sauce was just too sweet and thick that i really did n't know what i was eating hence i just stopped eating and considered my lunch a loss . = -lrb- i agree with a yelper that sun asian kitchen is a step above fast food but if i were to compare this tragedy with panda express , i 'd take panda over this hot mess . overall my experience at sun asian kitchen was bad sauce , and would n't recommend this place to anyone at all . i 'm sorry sun asian kitchen , you 're a bad news bear . = -lrb-		2		0
i want to like this place , i really do , but today 's new york steamer was probably a top 10 disappointing sandwich of my life . soggy , lifeless , unimaginative , and overpriced . i 'd been to firehouse one previous time , and the meatball was better . far from spectacular , but much more satisfying than the corned beef/pastrami number i ordered during visit # 2 . it was steamed meat , cheese and mayo on an old-tasting white hoagie . no veggies , no color , no texture , no good . the firehouse concept and story are cool . the employees are nice . the fountain drink vending machine is second to none . and i enjoy being able to watch college hoops while my sandwich gets steamed to death . but these pros can not save an underwhelming experience that cost me $ 9 . subway 's $ 5 cold cut combo would have been a better investment .		2		0
we were stuck in chandler , called a friend and he recommended this place . it 's not bad . just average . i guess it is owned by serrannos mexican restaurant so thematically all the food had a mexican flair to it . you get a lot of food for your money . i just found this place unremarkable . i do n't know if i would go back , but it is better than denny 's ,		2		0
i am an avid shopper of healthier food stores . whole foods , trader joes , and sunflower are always on my list of go to places when i grocery shop . so , when a friend told me how great fresh and easy was i had to stop at the one down the road . of course , i read the yelp reviews 1st so i was excited to go . i have to say , i was disappointed . although very cheap , the quality of the produce was substandard . i can get better quality at wal-mart -lrb- not that i would . -rrb- i did n't try any of the `` easy '' meals , as none of them looked appetizing , and to be frank , i can make healthier options at home . i did find a handful of cheaper versions of things i purchase at other stores , which was nice , but overall not worth the extra stop . the price was right but the quality was n't up to my standards on most of their items . fresh and easy is a healthier option over a chain grocery store , but it is definitely not a cheaper version of the quality you get from the `` healthier '' grocery stores . a positive note : the staff here is very friendly and are always there to help .		2		0
found this place via living social and have been here several times since . it 's a classic spanish tapas joint . it gets busy on the weekends when they have live entertainment and flamenco dancers on the stage . when that happens , it can get loud and crowded in the lower seating area next to the stage . we sat there once and did n't like it ... it was uncomfortable and the better half and i could n't have a conversation because it was too loud . it 's worth checking out at least once though . over our visits , we 've tried the following menu items : pan con tomate , $ 9 empanada gallega , $ 9 croquetas , $ 11 spanish sausage , $ 9 peppers & goat cheese , $ 12 spanish fritatta , $ 8 out of the bunch , my favorites are the peppers and goat cheese , empanada , and the spanish sausage . the others are just ok . the service here is hit/miss and the wine selection is not very good . there are a lot of spanish wines on the menu , but they did n't taste good ... i 've sampled many of them and ended up disappointed every time . overall , it 's just an ok joint . return factor - 50 %		2		0
nice people , good food and a great beer selection . the waitress was great , and we really all enjoyed our sandwiches . but then again , i had damn well better enjoy them at $ 13 each !! if you `` upgrade '' your side , you 've got a $ 15 burger . and , after i ordered -lrb- during happy hour btw -rrb- i found out our beers were seven dollars each . $ 22 for a meal consisting of a cheeseburger and a beer ? think about it -- 4 people could walk out dropping $ 100 for cheeseburgers , after tax and tip . that 's just crazy . yes , the food was good but value is part of the equation and on that , cbcb fails .		2		0
this was my first time eating at a ruth 's chris restaurant and even though i was reasonably happy with my food , the overall experience did not live up to my expectations . it was a good meal but not worth the money . our total bill for two -lrb- including drinks , tax , and tip -rrb- was $ 200 and i think we could have had basically the same meal at the keg or flemings for half of that cost . or , for equal money gone to a much swankier place like j & g or capital grille and had a really pampered experience and more impressive meal . coming up the elevator and entering the dining room , i was surprised that it was such a casual environment . it could have been any family restaurant in a strip mall . i did not get an upscale steakhouse vibe at all . we were seated in a four-top in the center aisle and my chair got bumped several times by both servers and patrons . at some point one of them knocked my clutch purse off the table and then stepped on it which i did n't realize until much later . i have been to places -lrb- esp in nyc -rrb- where they crammed a lot more tables into a small space but there was something about the layout of ruth 's chris that was just really awkward and uncomfortable . i am sure if you sat in a booth you would n't have this problem but you still would have to put up with the lackluster decor and barely there background music . another thing that made me uneasy was that there was some woman -lrb- the manager ? -rrb- standing not more from 10 feet from me staring intently into the dining room for the entire meal . occasionally she would bark orders at the servers but i never saw her walk around and talk to any of the guests . as for the food , we started with the calamari appetizer . it was cooked adequately , though a little too much breading for my taste , but the sauce it came with was amazing ! it was like a sweet chili sauce and i could have drank a whole bottle of it . the only misstep was that they should have served it on the side rather than drizzling it on top since it made the breading get soggy . they brought out our salads before we had finished with the appetizer . this is a pet peeve of mine since i feel that when the pacing of courses is off it can really ruin the entire meal . but we both loved our salads ; i had the harvest salad which was full of flavor and the hubby had his usual caesar and he thought this was one of the best he 'd had in a while . it had big chunks of shaved parmesan in it which was cool . he ordered the cowboy ribeye and was pretty happy but he typically does like his steak unadorned with no condiments . personally , i would have appreciated some seasoning besides butter on my petite fillet . as others have mentioned , both steaks came out cooked a little more than we had asked for but i think that is likely due to the super hot plates that keep the meat cooking after they are brought to the table . the odd thing was that the bleu cheese `` crust '' was really just bread crumbs and cheese crumbles spooned on top . it was not melted or seared in as i was expecting . i do n't mind a well done steak so i enjoyed it but the lobster tail was a big disappointment . it too was a tad overcooked , but not so bad that it was inedible . however , the meat was extremely flavorless . maybe it is because i am used to maine lobster ? or maybe it was not fresh ? one thing is for sure , the blackening spices mentioned in the description were no where to be found . it was an extremly bland entree . the highlight of the meal was probably the mashed potatoes we shared which were delicious ! no complaints there . we finished our meals with dessert and coffee . i ate the chocolate and caramel cake that came with the ruth 's classics meal . it was good , but had that fresh-from-the-fridge taste . the hubby ordered the caramelized banana cream pie and even though he did n't like the super hard pie crust -lrb- this dish also had been in the fridge way too long -rrb- he did like the flavor of the banana pudding center . we both had two drinks each , he had beer and i had martinis and we were surprised to see how pricey those were . i do n't mind paying $ 12-14 for a specialty drink but i have never paid that for a basic gin martini . also i specifically asked for the bleu cheese stuffed olives but these were forgotten on the first round . our waiter was a friendly and funny guy but as the other reviewers have mentioned , there was a little bit of rushing us along while ordering and also some nudges to up sell at various points . overall , it was the same service i would expect at an outback or someplace similar but just not to the level of this price point . which is basically what i would say about the food and whole experience . i would n't refuse to eat here again because i think you could have a more economical meal if you skipped the drinks and ordered the ruth 's classics complete meal which is starter , entree , side , and dessert for only $ 42.95 . but this place is not worth spending more than that so i would n't recommend it when there are so many better steakhouses in town .		2		0
so ya ' want : food . beer . boobs and sports huh ? like most who try to `` do it all '' , this place excels at none . if you want great food go to cibo . if you want great beer go to the roosevelt tavern or lost leaf . if you want great boobs go to the hi liter . if you want great sports go to coach & willies . -lrb- all of those are within a few blocks of this place -rrb- if you want all of 'em in one great spot ... good luck to ya ' champ .		2		0
i pretty much loathe buffalo . i rarely find anything worth buying and when i do its no cheaper that if i went to the actual store . they staff isnt great in all senses and the music isnt very good . they only buy things you would be looking to buy anyway , and if they do choose to buy something of yours , they dont pay nearly as much as they sell it for .		2		0
i came looking for what i thought were standard items in larger asian grocery stores and was disappointed . mekong and lee lee on dobson have much larger selections -lrb- vegetables/herbs/meats / seafood -rrb- at cheaper prices . too bad because i live so close to super l. maybe i 'd come back if i wanted some peking duck or roasted pork from the deli .		2		0
i use to enjoy coming here , but it seems like the food has gone down hill slightly for the price . the english muffins are great if you do n't have the time/patience to make them at home , good for a quick fix . the last time i stopped in the pastry was dried out and the coconut cupcake was partially frozen . also the coffee was n't hot and the bar girl had an attitude when i asked if she had any newly brewed . nothing verbal just a snippy push of an airpot in my direction . they have tried to improve service , still some mistakes on take away , ie ; wrong pastries . parking is insane as it has been for several years . i think they should get rid of one of the retail displays and allow just a tad more room in front of the coffee bar . i thought a fight would erupt one day recently when the place was packed and there was a girl waiting to get coffee and her friend asked if she was ready , she replied that if she would be if people would stop hogging the coffee bar . i thought she was being funny and must know the guy in front of her , but by his look when he turned to look at her , i realized they were n't together . i waited for the verbal burst of profanity , but none came and i applaud his patience with the uppity little wannabee . i 've had better , but i am here and there are n't too many other alternatives for counter service . one suggestion for lgo , please use biodegradable take-away containers .		2		0
after a friend raving about this place for 6 months i had to go . i 'd say my turkey sanwich was pretty average . i 'd never go again simply for the fact they do n't have sweetener for their unsweetened iced tea . boo .		2		0
lets first start with the ambiance . the furniture and decor was outdated . it was dark , gloomy , and far from elegant being the prices were more then your average restaurant . it needs a lot of gordon ramsays help to fix this restaurant . the service was average , if that . we started with the shirazi salad which contained diced cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , a little bit of evoo , and a tremendous amount of lemon juice . it was very difficult to enjoy with the sour/tart aftertaste . since this was our first time , we decided to order the chefs special platter . it contained chicken breast kebob , ground beef kebob , and lamb kebob . on top of that we also ordered the shish kebob platter . this platter contained `` filet mignon '' kebob -lrb- biggest lie , filet mignon is n't a thin strip of meat which is tough , unless they do n't know how to cook it -rrb- , another chicken breast kebob and lamb kebob . we ordered these platters for some variety , but the funny thing is , there was no variety . all of the meats were marinated in the same spices/sauce that in result , did n't allow us to differentiate between all of the different meats . i am a foody and i cook traditional shish kebob at home , being that i am from the middle east . this restaurant does not deserve to sell and advertise their horribly tasting kebobs . having said that , their basmati rice was my favorite dish . that is why i 'm generous enough to give them two stars . in conclusion , 6 skewers of the same exact tasting meats , a huge portion of basmati rice , small bowl of salad , and two hot teas costed roughly 120 dollars with tip . do n't waste your time and gas . you would have a better service at mcdonald 's .		2		0
i would like to have eaten here but they did n't seem to want to serve us . it was a monday evening and the restaurant was only 1/3 full . we were seated for 15 + minutes without anyone acknowledging us . we even tried to flag down the hostess to find out where our waiter was and she kept walking by . the music was a little too loud and the interior was predictable . i am giving 2 stars b/c i have been to another ra location and liked their sushi .		2		0
i go here because it 's close ... but the store out in chandler is so much bigger and friendlier . the geniuses here are alright , but seem to always have an attitude or be swamped . plus , the store itself is usually swamped ... when i go in and need help , there 's nary a person to help me . last time i waited 30 minutes to ask a question about a laptop . either i 'm addicted to apples or just plain stupid because i would never wait that long in any other store . the lack of customer service , the wait times , and the general malaise of the staff here make me seriously consider not buying an apple again every time i visit this store .		2		0
maybe it 's because i 'm not a huge fan of burgers , or maybe my expectations were just too high ... the burger i had here was good , the chicken sandwich was pretty good too . the frozen custard ... well . . i 've never had frozen custard before , so maybe it was the best , but i did n't think it was any better than an original dairy queen soft serve . the service is rude , in my opinion . it was my first time and they asked what i wanted , so of course , to be easy i say `` however it comes '' and the response was in a better-than-you , teenage burger snob tone : `` well , they come plain , so you want it plain ? '' ummm ... no . `` okay , then i 'll take everything '' `` so you want pickles ? '' `` yes '' `` mustard and ketchup '' `` yes '' well , if i wanted to do it that way i would have asked you to name off the ingredients ... the fries were great and the chili fries were really great , but they still do n't hold a candle to my childhood fave - weinerschnitzels chili fries . . mmm ...		2		0
cute and sweet korean family running this place but really thought the donuts tasted like safeway or regular grocery store donuts -lrb- got the chocolate long john and cruller -rrb- . but i do n't have an alternative go-to donut place so i guess this is my only option and it 's not bad . would rather support them than buy a donut at safeway !		2		0
waited an hour for my server to swing by and close me out before tracking her down to ask for the check . . she said she would bring it over right away . 20 minutes later i found her again , and she apologized for forgetting about me . . told me to sit tight , and another 5 minutes later , handed me a giant bill with 4 other guys on it even though we requested separate checks in when we first ordered . then it took her another 20 minutes to figure out how to split it up . poor thing was dumb as rocks , and was clearly hired for her willingness to dress up like a whore and show her magnificent tits off to the world . she also messed up each of my friend 's orders , including mine . you have lost my business -		2		0
in one of my favorite movies michael -lrb- john travolta & andie macdowell -rrb- it has one scene in it where they are at a café and andie 's character sings this fun song about pies : pie pie me oh my nothing tastes sweet , wet , salty and dry all at once o well it 's pie apple ! pumpkin ! minced an ' wet bottom . come to your place everyday if you 've got em ' pie me oh my i love pie so i was with friends headed up to flagstaff for some shenanigans and one said hey we should stop at rock springs café for some pie , mind you we only been on the road for 20 mins and it was barely 11 , but hey its perfect pie time right ???? so i got that pie song stuck in my head and was thinking of all the glorious pies i get to try ! peach , apple , cherry , banana cream , coconut cream , pecan pies , chocolate silk pies !! oh i was very happy to be making that stop and was singing pie pie me oh my !!! i was ready to get a table at the café and share some pies with my friends ! when we got there , how quickly things changed . my excitement for being there was swiftly killed by the lack of customer service and rudeness of people who worked there . i went up to the hostess podium and said we are a party of 5 , we were asked what our purpose was , i told her to try some of your famous pies , we were told that they did not want us taking up tables in the café if we were just eating pies . -lrb- gawd forbid we would want to stop at a place that has famous pies and want to try said pies -rrb- we were directed to a stand to order our pies . now i did n't come to get a piece of pie in a plastic container as if i was ordering it from burger king or something . i wanted to sit down and have my pie presented on a plate , after all they say there pies are world famous , present it like it is , instead of fast food plastic stuff . the pie of the month looked really interesting and i would have ordered , but nope they are out . i went with the jack daniels pecan pie , it was $ 4.50 for the slice , now to me , it tasted like regular pecan pie , which by the way is my favorite pie , it was perfectly sweet and the pecans had a good crunch on them , but could n't tell it was made with jd . it just did n't wow me . and i now felt like this stop was a waste of my time , i do n't see me going 50 miles out of my way to order a plastic container of pie , they might as well just open up a drive through , the staff is already rude like most fast food places and if i want a pie that will wow me i can pick up a chocolate silk turtle pie in the freezer section at the local grocery store for under 5 bucks ! -lrb- edwards turtle pie , if you have n't tried , you should wow ! -rrb- the 2 stars was for the pecan pie , it was good , just did n't wow me like a world famous pie should .		2		0
the quality vs value of this place has completely plummetted in recent times and i had a very disappointing visit a few weeks ago . i had met a couple of friends for lunch who had never been here before . told them that it was one of the best soul food places i 've ever been to , which at time of stating had been quite true . i 've been coming here for about seven or eight years and i remember when the food used to cost $ 8.80 per plate - and after your meal someone was always walking around offering the dessert of the day to everyone . quaint and tasty and decently priced . now , everything is almost double that , over $ 14 per plate . and the flavours have gone downhill . i told these guys the cornbread at mrs white 's was all-world . out comes stale shitty cornbread that i guarantee was made the previous day - we got there at just after 11am so i know it was n't fresh . one of my friends asked for mac and cheese , they did n't have it . also did n't have red beans and rice , which is what i normally order . um , ok . i asked for smothered chicken . the other two asked for fried chicken . out come three plates of fried chicken . i was too hungry to care . then the guy comes out and says they do have mac and cheese . whatever . collard greens are n't flavourful at all - almost like something steamed out of a green giant freezer pack . fried chicken was okay , but not anything better than church 's and three times the price . and nobody offered any dessert , not that we would have had it anyway . the bill for all three of us came to $ 48 !! for basically something i could have cobbled together myself and i 'm not even kidding . kraft mac and cheese would have been tastier . fried chicken takes a little while but is n't rocket science . collard greens are a twenty-five cent side , and i almost broke my tooth on the cornbread . this place went from a treat to a disaster in one horrible visit . wo n't be back unless and until they literally halve their prices and go back to the quality hole-in-the-wall they used to be . at least they accept credit cards now - only took them a half century to figure that out . and to top it off , their website is just as jacked up as their prices . 2 stars .		2		0
i love wings , and i especially like them crispy so the skin is worth eating . their wings ... not so crispy and too fatty . good flavor , but fatty . hummus is one of my favorites , but their hummus had so much garlic in it that i 'm still breathing garlic fire this morning after brushing twice and using a ton of mouthwash . beware , it 's one of those `` oh , but you taste so good . oh , but i know i should n't . '' and you do it anyway . their pizza is good . we had the shrimp and bacon , and the pepperoni , sausage and peppers pizzas . they ran out of bacon , which was a bummer because you could tell something was missing . and who runs out of bacon when it 's on quite a few of their specialty pizzas ? the other pizza was good , all of the peppers and onions made it sweeter and i wish the sausage and pepperoni would have added some spicy/saltiness to the pizza to balance that out . great crust . super tasty , slightly crispy , slightly chewy . happy hour is great , so i ca n't complain about how cheap it was last night .		2		0
cartel is a mixed bag for me - their coffee is superb ; their service is horrific . they make a fantastic cappuccino , and have great toddy . yet i rarely go for coffee alone , and the attitude of the people working there make it so i can only go with `` purists '' . i 'm not talking about people trying to order `` carmel macchiatos '' or blended drinks , but people ordering things actually on their menu ! i 've seen customers harassed by employees for ordering a mocha , or wanting to put a pump of sugar in their cappuccino ... to the point of never wanting to come back . it almost entirely rules cartel out as a place i can take a friend or colleague for a relaxing chat . to me , a good coffee shop is a combination of quality coffee and atmosphere to enjoy it in . cartel does have tasty coffee , but they have been failing horribly on the rest . i advise against coming here with anyone other than hardcore coffee purists .		2		0
we really wanted to like lucille 's , really , we did . i married a southern boy , so as i was reading the online menu to him , he decided he really wanted to go . unfortunately for lucille 's , we 've already been to bobby q 's and lucille 's just does not stack up . drinks : hubby had an interesting dark beer made by albita ale in louisiana -lrb- although our server mistakenly said it was from mississippi -rrb- called turbo dog which had some rich coffee tones . i am not usually a dark beer drinker , but i liked it too . i had the sweet tea which was served in a big mason jar with a sprig of fresh mint . it was sweet , but not lolo 's sweet -lrb- god love ya ' lolo 's , but you 're not exactly helping prevent the diabetes ! -rrb- and that 's a good thing . appetizers : hubby just had to have him some fried okra . i tried two pieces to be a good sport , but the interior texture is something i just ca n't get over . he thought it was delicious and preferred the mustard dipping sauce over the spicy ranch . we were also served some biscuits -lrb- which we both felt were also made with some corn meal and this made them a little tougher -rrb- and some `` apple butter '' which was not really apple butter , but rather some sweetened butter tinged with cinnamon . not impressive . meat : hubby had the brisket and i had the tri-tip . the brisket is so far superior at bobby q 's in terms of tenderness . lucille 's was n't awful , though , and the `` mop sauce '' which is different from the three sauces that were in bottles on the table -lrb- original , memphis , and hot & spicy -rrb- was really good , and i usually do n't like bbq sauces . my tri-tip was very smoky in flavor , but rather dry . i asked for it dry -lrb- meaning no sauce -rrb- and was even challenged to do so by the menu itself which claimed that the true test of good bbq was having it sauce-less . and so i did . and lucille 's did not pass the test on the tri-tip . sides : hubby had shoestring fries which we both agreed were delicious , and also the peanut slaw , which is a vinegar based cole slaw tossed with peanuts and peanut oil . it also had large pieces of yellow and red bell pepper in it , which made it inedible for me , but hubby thought it was quite tasty and certainly different from any slaw he 'd ever had . i had the macaroni and cheese and roasted corn . the corn was delicious , but i had no idea it would be on the cob . at bobby q 's , they roast it , slice it off the cob and serve it in a little bowl , which i prefer . the mac and cheese was an abomination for a place that claims to serve southern food . i am not sure there was any real unprocessed cheese in it . i have had better from a kraft deluxe box . dessert : i am glad we tried the dessert because the banana pudding was the true standout . i have never had banana pudding that has not been from a can , so the homemade version at lucille 's was a treat . it had some pieces of fresh banana and vanilla wafers tossed throughout the large serving -lrb- more than enough for 2 -rrb- . it was topped with real whipped cream -lrb- not redi-whip -rrb- . service : the service was quite good , attentive but not annoying . a manager stopped by our table toward the end , and hubby made a comparison between lucille 's and bobby q 's . the manager said that a few other managers had come over from bobby 's to lucille 's , and implied that something was amiss at bobby 's in the overall running of the place . whatever that is , it is not overt , as hubby and i never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at bobby 's . we decided that we 'll give lucille 's 6 months to work out what we hope are some opening bugs , and we 'll return to try again . in the meantime , you 'll see us at bobby 's .		2		0
an update to this review . after all this happened , the event organizers complained to the corporate office . apparently , the follow up to this was that the manager who was leading the charge on doing this was fired . good riddance .		2		0
i was pre-warned that this is a dive bar , but still , this was low even for my standards . there was n't much that i really cared for except for my cheap $ 3 mich ultra . the place is really small and it was packed so it was really difficult to move around . the bathroom was insanely small and crowded with a bunch of chicks primping -lrb- not that this place really called for any necessary primping -rrb- . i can get past all of the surface stuff , but the service is what really turned me off to this place . although the bar was pretty full , there were n't many people actually sitting at the bar , so i sat down on a stool and waited about ten minutes to even be asked for my drink order . i get that can happen when people are busy , but the bartenders walked right past me and looked at me a few times , cash in hand . after i did get my first drink , getting the second was even trickier ! after seeming complely invisible to the bartenders i was finally served by the barback that happened to be up there putting something away . everyone elses reviews seem to indicate this is a cool place , so maybe i just was n't in the right frame of mind . either way , waiting so long to be served is a big downfall at a bar in my book , so coach house gets 2 stars for now . i 'm not opposed to giving it another try though and hopefully my next experience will get a higher rating !		2		0
we had n't been to texaz in about ten years , so we thought it would be fun to take the kids last weekend . it 's still crowded and with the animals , posters , newspaper articles on the walls and hundreds of ballcaps hanging from the ceiling , the atmosphere at texaz is a genuine version of the type of place that chain restaurants pay designers big money to create . for kids , its a cornucopia of sights and sounds to look at which accounts for the two stars i 'm giving it . however , it does n't get any more stars because the food has really gone downhill . naturally my wife and i ordered the meal that this restaurant is famous for - chicken-fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy and as i said , we had n't been there in about ten years , but there is no way the food used to be this bland . unfortunately , this was one of the most boring chicken-fried steaks i have ever had . the breading had no flavor and the gravy did n't add any either . i like good chicken fried steak , but this was n't it . in fact , i 'd be embarrassed to bring anyone from texas to this place . sorry texaz , i know you 're a central phoenix institution , but you 're riding on past glory .		2		0
what is worse silicon filled waitresses , or cream cheese filled sushi rolls ? i let you make the call . i feel like the commish from those miller lite comercials , the more taste league . the commish is wise ! '' this place is over priced , but better than ra . your sushi mantra should be the following : abra = anything but ra . they have good miso soup , which leaves meso hungry ... for lack luster rolls , and small cuts of fish , oh and if you 're up to it , get the attitude roll from the patrons ... you know the dudes with the wide open club shirts , bootfit jeans and black dress shoes . this place blows like a whale in puget sound ... save yourself ...		2		0
dined late night at az88 wanted soup , but ended with dessert and salad . i had a key lime tart , which was a bit too acidic for me . the size portion was great perfect for sharing . my friend had the four seasons salad came with choice of two dressings , balsamic vinaigrette and fat-free raspberry vinaigrette . the fat-free raspberry blended together nicely with the bitterness of the spouts in the salad . the service can be sort of slow . the atmosphere in the courtyard is still great , but the food and value has gotten a lot worse ...		2		0
i was worried when i walked in because of the cheesy decor you might find in a chain . this place is pretty good - i am a spicy addict . however , with so many other great mexican choices in the area , it may be a while before i go back .		2		0
not many menu choices but we both ordered the chicken fried steak & could have shared one plate . we both had half our plates left over . that would have been nice to know ahead of time . the bread they serve before dinner is ok ; it kept the kids occupied until the food came . the food we ordered was ok but i do n't think we will be back . slow waiter service as well .		2		0
this is not the place to go for fabulous mexican food . it 's not bad , but it 's like going to applebee 's and expecting a great steak . i really only like their happy hour cause it comes with free food . mini chimis , chips and salsa and taquitos and such are free if you sit in the bar . i have n't been in awhile , and all locations are different , but from i remember , margaritas were n't a hh special , which is pretty much blashpemy . for friday hh there is usually a dj . this particular location has been going through some heavy renovations , as there will be a light rail stop literally on their patio doorstep -lrb- p.s. the otuside area is huge -rrb- , so imagine in the next few years this plca will have a fairly large crowd for hh all week long .		2		0
food was great but crazy overpriced ... they just opened at 5:30 pm and we arrived at that time , the couple next to us arrived a couple minutes later and was told their order would take at least 90 minutes . why ? they just opened , so i asked our server if ours would take that long and he said `` no '' so we continued to order . the food truly was great but the prices were way too high for what you get . i understand `` tappas '' style and like the sharing idea of food but when each dish is 16-20 dollars and you only get a few bites you 're not a fan of sharing .		2		0
do not go to concerts here !!! i payed $ 250/seat for `` row 32 '' in section 105 . now , `` row 32 '' generally means there will be approximately 32 people between you and the stage . this seat was more like the nose bleed section . the people on the stage looked like action figures they were so far away . also , the lighting in the place is terrible . when a band starts to play , the room is supposed to go completely dark - this place is so lit up with hotdog and beer stands , the stage effects did n't work . the performers were amazing , but the venue is terrible . we will never go to a concert here again .		2		0
these are not real french treats . i 'm surprised some of the reviewers say they 've been to paris . first of all , they 're not macaroons -lrb- those are jewish coconut cookies -rrb- they are macarons -lrb- one `` o '' -rrb- and these were the most amateur macarons i 've seen . the feet are big -lrb- the feet are the rim of the cookie -rrb- and the cookie body itsself is airy and thin whereas a true macaron is light but does n't actually have air pockets in it -lrb- the cookie dough is still present throughout -rrb- . the filling is not ganache like it should be - it 's a buttercream like you use for cupcakes . chocolate croissant was decent so i 'll add a star for that .		2		0
i 've been here twice now . i would go again if a friend wanted to only because the location is perfect for before or after an asu volleyball game . the happy hour is decent . $ 3 vodka & cranberry . $ 3 garlic mushrooms . i would n't pay more than that for either item . i tried the $ 1.99 veggies with medium buffalo sauce and blue cheese . of course the veggie and blue cheese were fine but i did n't care for the medium flavored buffalo sauce . i also had the soft pretzels with queso and garlic parm sauce . the pretzels are small and hard and have no flavor . the queso is icky and so is the garlic parm sauce . i like that kid drinks are free but my kids did n't care for the wings , boneless wings or small burger . they do like the dessert pizza but it is $ 7 !!! plus they had no cheesecake bites the second time we had it . the service once was fine and the second time was horrible and slow . also the tv 's are so loud it hurts my ears .		2		0
really great chips and salsa ... . but that 's where it ended ! insert sad trombone sound effect here . -- -rrb- -lrb- -- the food was just okay ... and our service was absolutely atrocious . we had a group of 15 that included friends of friends ... one of whom worked there ... . and was constantly up helping our lousy server ! the drinks were also weak and took a long time to get ... bad service + mediocre food + lousy drinks ... + great chips/salsa ? = 2 stars -lrb- chips/salsa saved it from being a one star visit ... -rrb- . unfortunately , i 've come here for decades ... . but after similar experiences twice now ... my wife and i are sure to have made our last trip ...		2		0

conflicted on this review but i am going to stick to my guns . i am a huge fan of papago beers and love that they have 25-30 on top plus 7682763 beers -lrb- not actual number -rrb- in bottles that you can drink there or take home . it is extremely loud inside which some nights can be tolerable but if you get a table of guys shouting at each other it can be distracting if you are looking to hang with friends . my meh review comes from the food . their menu has a lot of variety and everyone loves pizza right ? i ordered the pretzel which itself was amazing , just the right amount of chewy and fluffy . the cheese sauce it came with did nothing for the dish . i also ordered the california blt salad and here is where more disappointment came in . i ordered the 1/2 size which was a huge portion but it really did disappoint . the avocado slices on the salad were not ripe and were rock hard . the diced chicken was so bland and dry it tasted like it had been boiled . the worst part was the bacon . it was clearly the kind of pre-cooked , thin sliced bacon you can buy in the store . the whole thing was pretty half assed with ingredients that are n't that difficult to make . over all i wanted to give 5 stars but the place gets 5 stars for beer , 3 for ambiance because of how loud it gets and a solid 1 on the food . i know it is a brewery and i should expect much in regards to food but come on , it 's not that hard .		2		0
i mean it 's a bar they have drinks . if that is what you are going for cool . you can catch a game there , its not bumpn like it used to . its a little on the quiet side . the crowd looks like its about a 40 + group . and a good handful of random creepers checking out the serve staff there . i would n't say i wont come back . but its definitely not first on my list for the kinda of bar scene i 'd normally be looking for . service was good . but thats because there wasnt many other people to serve the day when i went .		2		0
dukes more like pukes . positives - avg food and descent service negatives - this place is dirty the chairs were dirty and the glasses and cups were old and dingy . my friend was given and ice holder that keeps the beer in the pitcher cold and it was broken and looked old and nasty . also a weird crowd with very little scenery , if ya know what i mean . wo n't be back !		2		0
i was all set to order after downloading the menu two days before we went , then when we arrive on sunday late morning , things went awry ... first of all the homemade tomato soup is not exactly home made in that they use canned tomatoes for the soup which means it is filled with nickel , metal , lead and bpa ... so i could not have the tomato soup as they were not able to use any fresh tomatoes for the soup , not exactly sure if they use canned tomatoes for the omelettes but this is what the waitress eluded to ... also they do not know what the ingredients is in lots of their products especially the bread since they do not make it , it is delivered from a vendor and there is no ingredient list ... very very bad service on their part , they should always know what the ingredients is for everything they serve especially for folks who may have allergies ... the other people in our party got the build your own omelette which was very expensive , they did not have a veggie omelette on the menu you have to build your own ... so the omelettes ended up being over $ 12.00 since they charge .75 cents to $ 2.50 for extra items ... the orange juice is also very expensive 4.00 for what look like a 6oz glass and $ 7.00 for what looked like a 12 oz glass . plus it was very very noisy , we literally had to yell at each other to hear ourselves plus ... just the fact they did not know what the ingredients was in their bread , and many of their ingredients come pre-packaged not made from scratch ... is not good ... there are better places in old town , , , which have organic food offerings and they know what they are serving , unlike the breakfast club ... . . if you have food allergies avoid this place !!!		2		0
eeeehhhh ... a group of us came here on a saturday to take advantage of the patio and our beautiful weather , and i 'll admit , i was so , so disappointed . i 'm completely shocked it has such killer reviews . one : they do n't have high chairs . big slap in the face as a parent , if i 'm being honest . you do know you lose a customer when you so blatantly tell them their children are n't welcome ... you know that , right ? not all children are misbehaved nuisances , and if i want to bring my kids out with me for a nice afternoon lunch in which we all enjoy ourselves , then i will ! and you will have a high chair ! and you will not rudely tell me `` we do n't have those '' when i ask for one ! because then i get on yelp and do crazy things like use too many exclamation points ! so take a risk and order the damn high chairs . -lrb- also let me now point out that there were several dogs on the patio . so , i can bring my dog to slobber and shed and just be gross all over while i 'm eating , but i ca n't bring my child of high-chair-sitting-age ? -rrb- * rant over . ahem . where was i ? two : the servers were rude , slow , and all around unpleasant . not a good vibe when you 're trying to relax . -lrb- oh wait , i bet it was my crazy kids making everyone grumpy ! -rrb- we had to wait a good 10 minutes after sitting down for someone to clean our table/bring us menus/even notice we were there . turns out half of our group did n't want to dine here because of said awful service , but they did n't mention it until after we were there and seated . three : the food is alright , but not great . the coney is still good -lrb- though i 'm not sure it 's the best , per the new times -rrb- , and the mac and cheese is just alright -lrb- i personally prefer windsor 's -rrb- . the hus ordered the veg and he said it was one of the worst vegetable sandwiches he 's ever had . i 'm not sure why offering a decent vegetable sandwich is so difficult for many restaurants in phoenix . four : ambience . there was none . no music was playing , the tables and chairs were flimsy with no place settings/decorations , there 's no art or plants or really anything inside or out . i probably wo n't ever be back to tmi , because frankly , there are just so many other places that are way better . * i understand i went totally nuts , and that not offering high chairs does n't mean they do n't welcome children , but really ? come on .		2		0
pros : - cute parisian themed decor - crepes tasted pretty good cons : - small portions - dirty silverware - poor customer service i asked the waitress for a new knife , because mine had food stuck to it , and she seemed incredibly put-out , as if i had just asked for her first born . she also forgot my water , which i found strange , since we were one of only two or three parties in the entire restaurant . the crepes were pretty good , but pretty small . i prefer jobot in downtown phoenix for crepes .		2		0
so scottsdale needs a good sports bar ... so i reallly wanted to like blue 32 . but in the end i am not very impressed . let 's start with the first thing that sets the tone for your dining experience , the hostess and wait staff . this was my third time there and we arrived during saturday college football . it was me and three buddies . the hostess had no idea what was going on and she was walking us to a table in the bar when two other people took it from right in front of us . instead of her telling them to get up she made us wait . we waited for close to an hour . finally we get a seat at the bar . now the tv situation at blue 32 ss great ... if you have an in with the guy managing the tv remote . we were there for the game of the week and they insisted the asu vs no one cares game was more important . i do n't think the bar manager got the memo that 85 % of the us who watches college sports was watching the game of the week . now to the food . decent not great . i have had their tacos , wings and burgers all of which were nothing but mediocre at best . if i could fuse the set up of blue 32 with the food from zipps or goldies then we would have a real scottsdale sports bar . for now we are stuck with this ...		2		0
ok . i love macayo 's , i always have . the food is pretty darn consistent and when i 'm going to a chain restaurant , that is what i expect and actually what i want . as per usual , the food was exactly what i had anticipated . i would have loved to give a 4 or 5 star review on the food , but that 's not what this review is really about . this is a service review . matthew and i went to dinner with my parents last night -lrb- sunday -rrb- around 645 and paul was our server . now , i do n't know if he was new or one of those older , jaded servers who think they know everything . sometimes they 're hard to tell apart . this guy seemed like he did n't want us or anyone else to be there , like he had better things to be doing than his job . if you do n't like people , do not be a server . seriously . had to ask for refills two separate times after near empty drinks -lrb- 1 '' left in glass -rrb- sat for 10 minutes , had to ask for more chips twice , and he dropped matthew 's plate on the way out of the kitchen and said `` did you hear that crash ? that was your taco , they 're making you another one . '' which took another 10 minutes . oh and my favorite ... my dad ordered shrimp fajitas . the food comes -lrb- minus matthew 's -rrb- and what kind of fajitas do we receive ? beef . i said to my dad , `` did n't you order shrimp fajitas ? '' he replied that he did in fact do so and stated such to the server . paul said that was incorrect , that he wrote down beef . my dad said that was n't what he ordered and that he would indeed like shrimp . so i do n't know how you get beef from shrimp , or even steak from shrimp . yes , they 're all monosyllabic . but they 've got differing vowel sounds and one of those words starts with a different letter even ! he was totally rude and when i go back -lrb- it 's inevitable , i like their generic food occasionally -rrb- i will specifically request to not sit in paul 's section .		2		0
yes , i 'm spoiled . i grew up in denver and enjoyed dia -- the most pristine airport you will ever visit -- for the majority of my life . in comparison , sky harbor is just another run-of-the-mill airport . the food sucks . one time before a flight i had a teriyaki chicken bowl at one of the generic restaurants -lrb- i decided this would be one of the most healthy options aside from quiznos -- too many delicious dipping sauces ... -rrb- . i must not have been thinking about the effects of eating a dish with an astronomical amount of sodium , because my feet swelled so much that i had to remove my shoes during the flight . lovely . parking is a nightmare . there is no logic the parking garage . it corkscrews you up and you 're suddenly on level 6 , without a hint as to the location of the terminal 's entrance . when i flew back home from my trip , i went out to the parking garage to find my car , only to realize that i was in the wrong terminal . if you 're flying on different airlines in and out of sky harbor , make note of the terminal where your car is parked ! one must take a shuttle between terminals to get between them . never fun after a day of traveling . i thought it would be relatively painless to simply pick someone up or drop them off here . what a nightmare . especially when you have to reach terminal 2 . beware : terminal 2 has no clearly marked signs for passenger drop off . i had to circle around and almost ended up back on the 202 , all while dodging the rude taxi and shuttle drivers that love to cut me off . disastrous when your precious cargo is about to miss their flight . the signs to get back on the 202 are n't very clear either . i need arrows . i need signs that say `` left lane 202 e '' or `` right lane 202 w '' -lrb- disclaimer : i have no clue if the right or left lane take you east or west -rrb- . how in the world they twist you around each side of every terminal and loop you through to the highway , i have no clue . obviously , i do n't enjoy coming here . but the hope of enjoying my destination city keeps me coming back . plus , i have no other choice . unless i buy my own jet . even then i will probably still have to deal with the crazy taxi drivers .		2		0
is it me or do you get more food at this chompie 's ? my plate was huge and it was full . i got my usual - cabbage rolls with potato pancake . normally i am able to finish this entire plate at the paradise valley and tempe locations . the cabbage roll was a bit sweet and the potato pancake was dry . i tried my friend 's home fries and it did n't have much flavoring . the glazed carrots were tasty though . it was my first visit so maybe i should have tried the matzo ball soup instead .		2		0
something about the old spaghetti factory that i love and then really do n't like , not sure what exactly it is . the pastas are just okay but other things on the menu are good . the ambiance is fun and family feeling . maybe it 's because the food is just okay but i want it to be better because i want to like the place . it 's holds some nostalgic memories for me as well as the the quirky atmosphere that some would call old , but i like it . it makes me enjoy actually being there , maybe not eating there though . this is a pretty lame review actually . what was the point of this ? not sure .		2		0
okay so i see tons of positive review ... time to bring into reality ... i am from oregon where there is a lot of good authentic asian food ... including pho . we got the pho-nomenal soup bowl ... dissappointing ... asked for chilli oil . . and they did n't have it and said sirachi sauce is all you need . really ? even the shrimp rolls were n't tasty . think quality though the price matches other pho places i being too . please re-think and makes some changes . i will be 3 months to see if anything has changed . i hope you are reading this . the two stars are for great customer service ... that is the only thing going good for you .		2		0
i came here today because i was in the area , and figured it was time to try some capriotti 's . it was my first time eating their sandwiches , so i figured , what the heck , i 'll give them a shot . the menu has tons of options , and they have a few different sized subs , 9 inches being the smallest . that 's pretty darned big ! i went with a 9 inch slaw be jo , and it came with meat , russian dressing , coleslaw , mayo and roast beef . the sandwich itself was okay , but i felt like it was missing something . . it tasted kind of dry . i wanted to ask for more dressing , but after about getting half way through , i figured decided not to . i think the sandwich needs to come with some kind of dressing , prefereably italian . it came across as somewhat dry . overall , prices were a okay . $ 6.99 for the sandwich , $ 1.59 for drinks plus some tax , and the total was $ 9.35 . not bad . i will say i was n't impressed overall , but it was n't the worst sandwich i had . i feel like there 's other sandwich shops in the area that serve similar but better sandwiches that might be worth trying before hitting up this place .		2		0
the place is bright and cute -lrb- too cute in my opinion -rrb- , the staff is friendly , and the wifi is free . unfortunately , the espresso drinks are horrendous . i gave this place two tries separated by a couple of months , with different baristas and the same unfortunate conclusion . my lattes tasted the way i imagine wet cardboard tastes . had to be tossed . sorry luci 's , i tried . too yupstery anyway .		2		0
i seriously considered giving king 's fish house 1 star , but our waitress was helpful and tried to accommodate us as best they could . however , my oysters on the half shell were small and served with some weird shaved horseradish , my steamed shrimp was rather boring , and my wife disliked her fish so much that she could n't finish it and asked for it to be sent back . she said it was over-cooked and flavorless . to be fair to the staff , the waitress and chef both came out to our table and offered to re-cook the fish or make something else entirely for her , but by then , my wife was too turned off to have anything else . i would never try king 's fish house again . for a guy originally from maryland who 's had some pretty amazing seafood , there was just too much wrong here to be given a second chance . for what it 's worth , my brother-in-law had the new england clam chowder that night with us and said it was the best he had ever had .		2		0
eating review of rokerij i want to like this place . its a great setup and well done environment . the setting is stylish and dark so you want to sink into a booth and get down to eating some food . unfortunately my first experience has left an impression that is less than stellar . my girlfriend and i had been wanting to try it out a few times . we got a booth by the fireplace and settled in for a nice meal . the specials are written up in chalk on the wall as you walk in which is a great method for displaying specials . we are both vegetarians that will eat fish and were excited by the plethora of fish dish choices on the specials board . this tends to say that a place can do fish . our server was nice enough but when we asked for some recommendations he stared at us blankly and grabbed the menu like he hadnt eaten there in a while . this is a huge pet peeve for me . if a place is gon na charge $ 20 or more for an entree the staff better be trained on the dishes and be ready to give some recommendations . show some passion and knowledge and sell me the good stuff . we ordered the white bean bruschetta to start . it was edible but lacking in flavor , maybe some salt wouldnt have hurt , but something more than just beans and toast please . next was the soup of the day which had a lot of smoke flavor going on , not impressed . finally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa . this dish started off a disaster and just got worse . first of all the server brings it over holding it with a towel . as we shift plates around to make room he starts yelping a bit in pain . not a great sign . once he gets it set down we move to dig in but my lovely date brushes her arm on the plate and comes away with a pretty solid burn . this is just plain stupid . there is no need for a plate to be 200 degrees . cook the food and then bring it out . dont cook it at my table on the plate ! unfortunately the fish was not edible , at all . the melon salsa was horrid . we sent it back and still got charged . rokerij i want to love you . there are a lot of folks on yelp that love you but i have to say that for food you have not impressed me .		2		0
going into this place really teleports you to an east coast bar/pub unfortunetly the local customers are not what you expect to see in an east coast bar/pub no obvious cops shooting the shit after a shift , frankly not a lot of people at all . of the two bars that shared the mccaffrey name . this bar is by far the lesser of the two . from what i 've heard seamus does n't even own this place anymore . maybe that is part of the problem ... police patches adorn the bar . . so i 'm surprised to not see any police . there used to be a large collections of lepperchans , i did n't see them last time i went -lrb- pub crawl -rrb- but i did see a friend from another bar ... that was cool . other then that . . i will continue to stay clear of seamus mccaffery 's . sorry bud . may ye luck be at anothee baah		2		0
i 've been back a few times , so thought it was time for an update . unfortunately , it was worse than i remembered ! i really do n't think the food is very good . i got the mushroom scramble last time . it was disgusting . i know those are strong words , but that is the way i feel . the food is way overpriced for what you get . i would rather put up with the hoards of annoying people at lgo than eat here .		2		0
we went in around 830pm on a friday night and it was very quiet inside . we asked about any dj or live music and the bartenders explained that they have a dj but not sure when they were coming in . we had a couple of drinks and hung out for about 45 min . and still no music . this bar has so much potential with it 's awesome location within the historical hotel san carlos . i was so disappointed to not have it be more lively or organized enough to have a dj that comes in a specific time each night on the weekends . prices were average for the bar . it felt like this place has n't been updated in a while and there is like a huge bubble lamp with a hot pink light inside ... ... the cool part is the chandeliers and the `` vip '' section that looks like my grandma 's living room .		2		0
i had their bo luc lac . not impressed , the flavor was really off . maybe this is because grew up in the san gabriel valley and lived near garden grove for 2 years . but all in all i would n't go back .		2		0
we kind of ended up here by mistake . we wanted to go to four peaks but did n't realize this was n't it until we were inside , so we stayed anyway . it was quite busy for a saturday at 3pm , and a service was slow . we ordered two appetizers when we placed our drink order and then placed our food order when our drinks came out . about 20 minutes later out came our appetizers ... with our food , and an apology from the manager . something about our appetizers order getting lost . anyway , they took the apps off our bill , so that was good . had the mozzarella sticks and the queso and chips . both were pretty yummy . i had the blackened fish tacos which were ok ... nothing great . the flour tortillas they use are way too big though . i had to tear a good inch off the top , and the fish filet inside did n't even reach the ends of the tacos . everyone else had burgers , and they said they were good . all in all , not horrible , but i do n't see us going back ... not when there are so many other restaurants nearby . my 3 teenage boys thoroughly enjoyed the scantily dressed waitresses though . my one son said `` this place should n't be called a brewery , it should be called a boobery ! '' . too funny . -lrb- this place is not a brewery , but we had told them were we 're going to four peaks -rrb- .		2		0
i have to say , i went to a lot of different hooter 's establishments throughout the 1990s , when i was in military . it was the natural place to go when you 're a bunch of young , low-income guys being shipped around from place to place . but i had n't been to one in at least 10 years . i was expecting it to be worse , because i 've heard these stories about how they 'll get sued now if they fire their waitresses for getting fat , but i had no idea how pussified this place had become . hooter 's used to be a chain of bars where guys go to watch football games and have hot chicks bring them beer . not anymore . there was a table of 6 chatty 50-something yentas sitting next to us , there were children running around , and the waitress talent seems to have suffered . then we get seated at a gross-ass table , had a pretty long wait before the waitress came by , and another long wait before it got wiped down , and i just wanted to get out of there . 1 extra star because a balcony on 5th & mill is a good thing , though i 'd go to gordon biersch -lrb- mediocre in its own right -rrb- over this place every time .		2		0

we have heard about this place for quite a while . given the friend reviews and the look of the building , one would think it was more of an upscale breakfast joint . instead we were greeted to a large open restaurant that was very loud and with what seemed like a group of robot teenagers running the place . the sense of urgency -lrb- to be seated , take order , etc -rrb- was there -lrb- as they rushed us through every bit of our visit -rrb- but with no individuality or customer service . autopilot . first , we are shown to a table that is not ready for us and we are left standing in the middle of the dining room . very awkward . then the waitress asks us what we would like to drink . coffee for him , coffee for me and ... had to get her to stop the robot talk -lrb- and almost flag her down as she walked away -rrb- so i could order an oj . since it was our 1st time , we took a bit of time to decide what to eat . the open menu on the table with my face buried in it should have been the first clue i was n't ready to order . but the robot-server came by 3 times ready to write everything down ; and i mean everything , spelled out and repeated as she wrote . wow ... the food was ok . a little on the bland side , but tasty . the chorizo was very flavorful and the sausage gravy was excellent . the menu is extensive with something for everyone - french toast , crepes , pancakes , skillets , specialties and more -rrb- . the food came out very fast which was good because we were hungry ! maybe my expectations were too high in general . i truly thought this place would have been nicer . if i want my check delivered to me in the middle of my meal , i would have eaten at denny 's . i was shocked and surprised .		2		0
just finished another meal here courtesy of a gift card . this place is always busy and i 've never been able to understand why . if no one ever gave me a gift card here , i would never eat here . the service varies from very good to awful , but the food always never exceeds `` well , it did n't make me sick . '' today 's meal failed even that low standard . as an appetizer i ordered some mini-corn dogs . i * love * corn dogs . at the fair , from weinerschnitzel , from frozen at home , and so on . these little balls of corn meal enriched pancake batter were deep fried to near burnt and yet managed to soak up enough grease to squeeze out nice puddle of oil . i only ate one , but within five minutes i was nauseas . the california omelet was not much better . sour cream should n't curdle , right ? the veggies and cheese were barely cooked . it was more like a salad wrap , where the wrap happened to be egg . if i had wanted a salad with egg , i 'd have ordered a cobb , not an omelet . the banana cheese cake was good according to the spousal unit & i enjoyed my strawberry lemonade . still have $ 10 left on the gift card . i think that 'll get me a couple of lemonades .		2		0
the food i tried was bad . not average but bad . that makes it difficult to give this place more than 2 stars . if i was just out for a beer before a movie this would be a good spot but i do n't think i 'd go for a meal .		2		0
this location is more hood stats given the area . you 'll definitely see a younger crowd here at the late shows on the weekends . do n't be surprise when you see people with strollers or young toddlers at a midnight showing of a rated r film , that 's just how they roll around here . -lrb- shaking my head -rrb- oh well , i 'm not giving the low rating because of some people 's questionable parenting ... although kids crying can ruin the experience which thankfully did not happen at this showing . i 'm rating it low because their seats smells ... it smells like sweat . yea ... gross , huh ? maybe they all do n't but i doubt it . i 've been here a couple of times and always had an uneasy feeling about the cleanliness . this last time just did it for me . no matter how convenient the showtime is -lrb- which is what usually makes it the deciding factor for us to come here -rrb- , i 'd much rather go to marketplace , chandler mall or tukee from now on .		2		0
only reason i am giving sushi brokers 2 stars instead of one is the atmosphere . which is what brought us there . my friend wanted to try it so we dragged our husbands to a date night . it is a fun , lively atmosphere . that is where the compliments end . let 's start with the food . ordered a whole bunch of sushi rolls . after 45 minutes they came out . they were mediocre . i ordered fried rice and the veggie lettuce wraps . the fried rice was fried rice . not bad , not fantastic . the lettuce wraps were the most disgusting things i have tasted . the veggies were so salty i could n't even finish them . i was curious about my friend 's side of wasabi mashed potatoes . i was sorry i tried them . they were waxy and had a funky sweet taste to them . everyone was not impressed with the food . our server was bitchy and incompetent . she seemed very impatient with us . did n't bring silverware and ignored us most of the time . the icing on the cake was when we were leaving and heard her bitching out someone on her cellphone in the parking lot . fun stuff .		2		0

since i 've been seeing signs claiming that capriotti 's was voted `` the world 's greatest sandwich '' i decided to give it a try . i decided to order an italian sandwich . first of all , i was a little sticker shocked ... they do n't have a combo meal so a medium sandwich , drink and chips came out to about $ 12.00 -- yowzers ! secondly , i was the only customer for a good 10 minutes -lrb- it was 5pm on a thursday -rrb- and my sandwich took forever to get done . . maybe i 'm use to jimmy johns and subway . i got mine to go and was very disappointed to find out when i got home that they gave me the wrong sandwich . how do you f-up an order when it 's the only customer in the restaurant ? i even double checked my receipt to make sure i ordered the one i wanted . instead of an italian i got some leftover thanksgiving ensemble . well , this yelper only eats stuffing on thanksgiving and does n't eat cranberry sauce or mayo at all . . i was so irate i gave the entire thing to my dog . . hopefully he wo n't get sick .		2		0
kiss the cook ? shit - they should fire the cook ! i should have known before visiting that i was n't going to like the place . after all , the az repugnant rated this place as its # 2 pick -lrb- behind matt 's big breakfast -rrb- as the top place to have breakfast in the valley . as the six friends who read my reviews know , i 've never understood the hoopla around matt 's big breakfast - it 's ok - but geesh -- # 1 ? what happened to the farm at south mountain -- now that 's a unique-fantastic-organic-only-can-find-in-phoenix-phoenician experience . sigh - but i digress ... ross and i enter `` kiss the cook '' . the interior is special - hard wood floors , mismatched seats and tables -- we both say it reminds us of a country store . `` nana '' is the one who shows us to our seats . my hopes rise and i start thinking that az republic scored on it 's review . we order . service is friendly , coffee was a little weak , but ross loves the oj . then the food arrives . the presentation is impressive . my omelet was tall ! fluffy ! both ross and i were wowed ! then i cut into it and it was runny , soggy , and tepid -lrb- not really warm -rrb- . the waitress came by , asked how everything was -lrb- and she seemed to really mean it versus the polite ask but they do n't really care to know the answer question that usually comes from waiters -rrb- . i told her about the omelet and she offered for them to recook it . she came back with my same omelet that must have been thrown in the microwave . the top was steaming but interior now warmer - but not yet warm . i picked around the soggy parts and ate the top -lrb- that was ross ' suggestion -rrb- . the waitress came back again , concerned that i was n't eating enough . she was so sweet . i did n't want to make her feel badly . but she sent the manager over -- which i thought was very proactive customer service . the manager -lrb- maybe the owner ? -rrb- , stopped by and asked me what i thought might be wrong and offered up that it might be the egg beaters . she did not offer me something else -lrb- but did suggest the next time i go in i should try the pecan cinnamon roll -rrb- . and , when we got our bill , the omelet was still on it -lrb- they did n't comp my meal -rrb- . we paid and no complaint . i do n't expect to be comped , i just thought the experience with the manager was interesting .		2		0
so we popped in to get some food , we thought they were still doing the beer , fries and bud light for 8 bucks but they were n't . no biggie . we decided to eat here anyways . my buddy and i decided to split the burger , since we already had an app at st francis and were going to hop around downtown and probably eat more . we ordered the burger medium , but it came out well done . we did n't want to be picky about the burger because we were sharing it , but it sucked . like really sucked . it was flavorless and overcooked . blah . so we ask for the check and are ready to leave , finishing our beers . my buddy goes to finish his beer and sees a ton of dishwasher chunks floating in his cup ! are you serious ? we flag down out waitress and let her know . she offers my buddy a new beer , but we were on the way out the door . the manager was sitting right by us an said nothing , no '' hey guys i 'm sorry '' nada . . and they did n't even comp the beer ! wow . guess who 'll never go back ???? this guy !		2		0
this place stays alive becase there are hungry jurors trapped in the basement of the grand jury room who need food . the carpet has n't been cleaned since probably the nixon era . and the food is pretty standard . that said , everyone has to go there at least once so that they say they have a -rrb- survived it b -rrb- been there c -rrb- surprisingly crave it . most people pick a , but some surprisingly pick c. it 's an old-school phoenix thing and you have to support that !		2		0
despite being a red-blooded american male , i find this place a bit below average . yes , the waitress wander around in shorts that would make a cheerleader blush -- but rail thin bottle blondes do n't do anything for me or the food itself . i 've eaten here twice : the first time , i ordered huevos rancheros and coffee ; today , i had the protein pancakes . in both cases , the service was mixed and the food was bland . my food came out quickly both times , but my server disappeared each time as well . today , i sat for 15 minutes until i was able to get the attention of a manger who located my server for me . the food itself is not bad , but nothing to cheer about . the protein pancakes were enormous and dense , but not nearly as flavorful as one expects from an item filled with almonds , blueberries , and cinnamon . as others have noted , they 'll ding you on side orders -- sour cream , tomatoes , guacamole , and the like will all cost you a pretty penny for diner-quality stuff . finally , it does n't affect the food , but the decor is garish and plain . remember that first apartment you got after college with the white walls and tan carpet ? this is basically the us egg aesthetic .		2		0
they do n't have soymilk . or any non-dairy options for coffee . but ... is n't this a breakfast/morning only restaurant ? and are n't we in north scottsdale ? just checking . they do have a coffee on the menu that sounds delicious , but is of course `` already made '' and they ca n't serve it without the condensed milk . i would have totally ordered it and went without milk if it meant i could partake in the yummy-sounding cardamom and cinnamon infusion , but alas , they said it was already all pre-made . anyway , we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table in a space that seems like it could easily fit ten more tables in there -lrb- i only walked in the first room , not the second one -rrb- , so it just felt oddly empty . service was nice , everyone was friendly , food did n't take too long , and the food was pretty good . i ordered an egg white omelet with spinach , asparagus , and mushrooms , with a side of sweet potato tots . the tots were alright , but not nearly as delicious as i 'd hoped . something about them was off . omelet was fresh and tasty , but swimming in butter/oil -lrb- order it dry if you 're watching your calories ! -rrb- . my friend and i split a 1/2 order of the caramelized banana and pecan french toast . i have to give the restaurant credit for offering half orders of anything , but especially for something so heavy and delicious sounding . do n't you hate going to brunch and having to decide between being healthy or a total glutton ? i only ended up eating a few bits of the cloyingly sweet french toast , which was n't the worst i 've had but i certainly would n't order it again -lrb- and i love sweets -rrb- . also , * they close at 1pm * , and we were still eating at 1:10 and were probably the last people in there-they clear it out by closing time ! this is not the place for a lazy sunday morning brunch , unless of course you are a very early riser . i would only go back to try out their infamous waffle dog , but i need to be up super early and bring my own coffee if i plan to go for brunch one weekend !		2		0
i was a huge mellow mushroom fan years ago when i lived in atlanta ... there were several locations there at the time and they never did me wrong . i especially liked their pretzels and their signature esperanza dressing . so when i heard they were opening in phoenix , i was psyched ... and you 'd think that with four locations within 25 miles , i 'd have eaten at one of them before today , but that is n't the case . so today when i realized that i had the time in my schedule to have lunch with my mother-in-law and son , i suggested mellow mushroom , and they obliged . when we walked in , i could n't help but compare this location to the more casual and laid back atmosphere of the locations in atlanta . this city north location is fancier , but i guess that is what comes along with being in city north - a newish development . we were seated way in back in a booth and gary was our waiter . he was friendly , and took our order in a timely manner , but the kitchen was supposedly way backed up due to a catering order and it took a good 45 minutes to get our food -lrb- 2 salads and an order of kids mac & cheese -rrb- . i drank my entire water while waiting for our food and it was never refilled . after waiting a good 30 minutes , i asked if my son could have some crackers since he was starving and we were given some chips ... and then finally it arrived . the kids portion was perfect and came with some apple slices . when our salads finally came , we had to take them to-go due to time constraints . i 'm not sure if it was because we got them to-go or because we didnt ' get the pretzels , but neither the food or experience was as pleasant as my memories from years of visits to the atlanta locations of mellow mushroom . the manager did end up comping our meal due to the time we spent waiting , which was a nice gesture ... but even so , if i return , i 'd likely just call ahead and get my food to-go .		2		0
so very nearly a 3 star - this place is 2.5 -lrb- why ca n't yelp do half-stars like flixster ? -rrb- ... the place is a conceptual hodge-podge priced for the super-rich . i felt uncomfortable there - but a lot of that has to do with my occasional social anxieties . still , canal oozed pretentious asshole -lrb- present company excluded -rrb- . i ca n't even call it douche because douche ca n't afford this place on their waiter wages . even if i had this kind of money , i would n't go here ever ... it 's just not for me . i liked some of the concepts and the runway and curtains looked kinda neat ... but then the exposed pipes on the ceiling looked like a cross between cool and gross as some of them appeared to be sewage lines - why would i want to have a meal with sewage lines running along the wall right next to my plate ? the menu was also this odd hand-made confusion ... everything about this place was one-off . even the appetizers had attitude - a simple bacon and cheese finger sandwich clearly aspired to be more . it was delicious , but c'mon . i did n't drink anything - i simply had a diet coke . the server was very nice , but brought my coke out with a huge lemon slice on the rim which left seeds in my drink . odd . it 's relatively new though , i 'm sure the kinks will get ironed out over time . i 'd like to see a fancy-pants place like this serve a turd pate - like plate up the shit they scoop out of shrimps and garnish with mint leaves - and charge 80 bucks for it ... i bet people would eat it and pay for it . bah . sarah and i wandered around the mixed shops and arrived at the end before realizing it was more than one store . they all sold the same crap - most of it was grossly overpriced . again - this goes beyond douche - the clothes were more stylish and simple and much more expensive than douche can afford . to be honest , much of it was quite nice - but still , if i had a billion dollars , i 'd feel like a fraud paying 800 bucks for a casual jacket or 300 bucks for a t-shirt . wasteful . i am surprised that this sort of thing has permeated this far south - i thought it was a north scottsdale thing . i 'm discouraged because i do n't like the crowd this sort of place will attract , but at the same time i like what it 'll do to my property value . the reputation scottsdale has really bums me out because i live here and i love it here . there are so many places to go where you do n't have to encounter the douche-ness . it 's just becoming increasingly more difficult to convince anti-scottsdale people to come . eventually everyone here will be bobble-headed plastic robots with too much money and no taste ... i 'll be consumed or assimilated or destroyed . i do have a feeling that the bottom will fall out and this mansion of cards will crumble to the ground - scottsdale is living beyond its means . or perhaps ` if you build it , they will come ' is the thinking . this is a strange time indeed . it was my first yelp event and i realize sarah and i were antisocial - i attribute much of it to the setting ... which was unsettling .		2		0
ordered the spinach & goat cheese salad w/chicken ... the chicken seemd very greesy ! you have your choice of either grilled or crispy chicken ... i chose grilled ... funny , i did n't see an option of ` greesy chicken '' as one of the choices ! -lrb- ... being scarcastic -rrb- . i wanted no raisins in it , but they told me i would have get no nut-mix at all since raisins come in a mix with pumpkin seeds & dried cranberries , so i did that . i also ordered their smash fries , which were on the cold side ... i should have returned them for a hot order , on top of that , they were very greesy as well , & just not to fresh to me . i probably should have gotten the sweet potato fries which are better tasting , but i thought i 'd try these . also , their back door was open and it seemed like someone was smoking outside & the cigerette smoke was coming in to the restaurant ! ... i was not happy about that . also , someone was wearing a lot of cologne near by ... ugh ! i do n't think i will want to eat here again ... in-n-out is much better & less expensive . ... perhaps a salad is not the thing to order here , i once had a chicken sandwich here & that was pretty good , maybe just stick to that in the future , if i come back here again . : -rrb-		2		0
what a place ! what a view ! what the heck ? i came here with my wife the sunday before valentine 's . it was my first time there and boy is it beautiful . we pulled up in awe and had the valet take the car . hostes was nice and said we could sit in the bar or patio -lrb- both have great views -rrb- . after walking around and weighing our options we chose the bar with a seat by the window . it was very dead as they were transitioning from brunch to dinner -lrb- it was around 2 or 3 -rrb- . so , we sat down at the bar and waited ... and waited ... and waiters and bartenders were walking by and cleaning ... and we kept waiting trying to get someones attention . we waited some more ... we left . are you kidding me ?! my wife is georgous and we were both dressed to the 9 's . how does waiter after waiter ignor us ? there were only 2 other people in the bar/loung area . we tipped the valet -lrb- he did n't do anything wrong -rrb- and he asked us why were were leaving so quickly . we told him and to his credit he wanted to go get a manager but the `` romance '' was gone so we headed down the road to olive and ivy to relax on their patio . hope your experiance is better than ours .		2		0
this cupcake shop is hit or miss . the last time i was there i ordered 5 cupcakes . one for myself and 4 boxed up to give to a friend for a small birthday gift on top of the gift i purchased for her . well , need to say my milk chocolate cupcake was raw and not thoroughly cooked inside . have not been back since .		2		0
the bar is nice as a bar , but thats all this is , a bar , that plays country music . lame ! no dancing ? way lame ! the screens and tv 's are huge . we watched the silva / weidman fight here and really liked the visibility and lay out of the tv 's . i 'm sure i 'll come back for football season and other fights , but i expect a lot more from a name like `` dierks bentley 's whiskey row '' .		2		0
i 'm not sure where these other reviewer 's are going ... maybe the sandbar in scottsdale ? this particular one is badly run . we 've tried twice ... the drinks are weak , prices average , lousy food and mediocre teeny-bopper servers that would n't know a screwdriver from ... well ... a screwdriver . i hear the one in scottsdale is decent ... but stay far away from the one in peoria .		2		0
ca n't remember the last time i was at a hard rock cafe . this visit was only memorable for 1 -rrb- amanda peachey 's gorgeous face and voice 2 -rrb- the jungle like humidity inside the place . our servers were attentive . our drinks were frequently refilled . but it 's just not as `` hard rock '' when it 's so family friendly . it 's a very small space , and being in downtown phoenix on a saturday night in summer , it was sparsely populated as well . maybe i 'm missing the point , but overpriced drinks and signed guitars on the walls do not bang my shutters .		2		0
looks like i 'm not going along with the majority here . i experienced just happy hr here a few months ago and was not happy with the service . the bartender was very unpleasant and not quick on her feet . needless to say the hh drink specials can be hugely improved . very weak selection . the food on the other-hand was good . we ordered the soft pretzel bites $ 5 which can feed a family of 4 ! and the antipasto platter was not as good . there was only 2 slices of tiny bread to eat with the cheeses , jams , etc. . if i did n't have the pretzels i would have been pissed . brussel sprouts came along side antipasto , they were prepared in a balsamic like marinade and were pretty damn great ! prob would go back fro pretzels and brussel sprouts but that 's abt it .		2		0
a disappointing cacophony of in-your-face flavors . having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi , my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming . like the music , i can see how the pasta bar dishes may appeal to many , particularly those who favor flavor intensity and/or creativity over all else . for my taste buds , this was overload . interesting yes , but i ca n't say i found it good . here are some details : pasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial . i prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi . maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal . sauces - here is the in-your-face part . the gnocchi sauce is spicy , overwhelmingly so for me -lrb- although i do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp -rrb- . despite my personal intolerance to hot food , a more delicate approach would have been better . the le sarde sauce sounded interesting , mainly because i love sardines , but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention . i could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise . and what is with the dried hunks of bread ? i could not get beyond the oddness of this one . the carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors , and probably the dish i enjoyed most of the three . even on this one , the garlic was out of this world in intensity . on the good side , the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat . the atmosphere is modern and hip , while maintaining a touch of coziness . the ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality . and the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti/lasagna place . as a matter of taste , i 'm going to have to pass on pasta bar . for the price , i 'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony . if culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing , check it out .		2		0
the food is not terrible , just your typical low-end chain restaurant . i would categorize it somewhere between baja fresh and applebees . our waitress was nice and attentive .		2		0
my experience was only for takeout and not dining in so perhaps dine-in folks will have better luck . massamam curry and pad thai is a pretty safe bet when ordering at a thai restaurant you have n't been to before . sadly , the spice levels were off -lrb- one was waaay spicy , and the other had no flavor at all -rrb- . the curries seemed really watery and the pad thai noodles were mushy . i was sad : -lrb-		2		0
dear reader ... before you decide if this place is great ... think about what else you consider great . when you were 17 and you took a date to olive garden , okay , you get a pass . but , if you ever ever ever went on a date to outback , or red lobster ... just stop right now . you will think this place is just amaaaaazing . so come out , enjoy their food and on the way home jump out into traffic . -lrb- please do that behind me , so as not to make me late to work . -rrb- okay , that said ... this place struggles from an identity crisis . rokerij , who are you appealing to ? the fools that think that this is a classy joint because their previous best date was to applebees ? or are you a really good place ? this place should not have a $ 12 chicken sandwich with fries on the same menu as a $ 43 steak . choose one direction and stick with it . i called up at 6pm on a saturday , first available reservation was for 9pm . this is a good sign . i take the reservation and then went for a hair cut at urban hair ... see my other review , they rule . we get to rokerij at 830ish . i walk in the door , and apologize to the staff who are clearly at a waiter station . we must have walked in the side door . whoops ! no , thats the front . wait , what ? a friggin computer screen and some silverware , thats the front ? no no , it cant be ... oh yes . yes , this is phoenix . yes , this is the front . okay , okay ... im cool ... whatever . we will be downtstairs having a drink . the bar downstairs is okay . some 50 yr old dude trying to flirt with a 20something girl . standard . we have martinis . not bad , the bartender made it okay . chopin vodka . he didnt really know what to do with the vermouth , but it was okay . i chat with my friend , we are sitting on a couch , its pretty fun so far . a server comes down and says , `` your table is ready '' cool . we stand up . she goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub . we wait ... finally i walk over to her . ah hem ... should we just go upstairs ? she turns `` yep , i said it was ready . '' oooooh no . you had better walk my ass right up to my table . nope , i can already tell the service is going to be abysmal . we walk upstairs . we wait there for almost 5 min . then i grab a bus boy and in broken espanol , i ask him ... neccecitamos una mesa ... ya dig ? he starts wiping down a table . i ask my date ... why the hell do we have reservations again ? then as we are being seated , a hostess girl says , `` oh your table is over here '' welll princess , thanks so much for telling me that 10 min ago ... and we sit . the waitress comes over and says `` what can i get ya ? '' excuse me maude ... what is this a diner ? can i get a slice a pie and a glass of manners ? i ask her what her name is ... i then introduce myself and start to read some of the specials off of the wall . she gets the hint . i hate my decision to come here . we order more martinis ... vodka might make this better . we order some specials ... i get meat , lots of it . the food is very good , though pricey . im still annoyed that there is a $ 10 cheeseburger on the menu . dont get me wrong , i love a pbr and a burger ... just not what i was expecting after all of the reviews i read . when the time comes to order dessert , i think to myself ... seriously , lets just stop at starbucks . we get our check . the bottom line . this place has good food , but is not a fancy joint . if people said , its a decent bar with good food , i would say : `` heck yes , 4 stars , just needs some better service . '' but they think they are classy , and so does yelp ... its not . frankly , it shouldnt have anything on the menu over $ 27 . the service is friggin dreadful . a half drunk toddler could manage this place better . that is all ...		2		0
exceptionally mediocre with a side of highway robbery my wife and i went here for midweek dinner . first time . nothing to look at on outside . valet charges $ 2 ... okay . either let people park their own cars or offer free valet like most decent restaurants . inside , it 's like an older , dated , run down french restaurant . tables were not exceptionally comfortable , were close together . wait staff was just okay . not formal enough , nor timely . not unfriendly , but not friendly either really . i ordered the lobster bisque -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- while my wife ordered the smoked salmon quesadilla -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- . bisque was rich , savory , but a small portion not upsettingly small , but small . the quesadilla was perhaps the standout of the evening , but just a simple cheese quesadilla -lrb- and no longer hot when it arrived -rrb- , covered with cream sauce , and then overlayed with common smoked salmon . it was unusual as well as tasty , and the portion was a nice size . it was the only thing i would order again . for the main course , i had the boar -lrb- $ 36 -rrb- . my wife had the three fish entree -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- . my boar was medium rare , but it was about 2.5 ounces of meat with a few veggies and about a 1/2 cup of common mashed potatoes . the meat was good , do n't get me wrong , and drenched in a pool of spicy sauce . the sauce was the only thing great about the entree . i was done and licking my chops and eying the bread bowl to see if i could get filled in no time , given the quantity of food . my wife had the three fresh . to their credit , they did seem like fresh fish , and were properly cooked . she thought it was okay . i asked her for a comparison to our `` baseline '' fish restaurant , roy 's , with it 's predictably good fish , and she answered that it was `` nowhere near as good . '' the bread bowl was grilled bread you could get at safeway , and butter croissants that tasted surprisingly like the breakfast toaster pastries i had in the 80 's as a kid . we were not impressed . if the entrees had been $ 20 , i would have given this an extra couple stars probably . but at $ 36 , i expect to be `` wowed '' . and i surely was n't . the clientele was mostly 50-80 year olds . clearly , some people had been coming here for special occasions for the last few decades , and had to no problem with the food or prices . but this restaurant struck me as a chef/owner that was milking a reputation that was earned long ago , laughing every week on the way to the bank . my bill was $ 90 before tip . i was still hungry . and honestly , i would n't have paid $ 45 for it . i surely wo n't be back . and i ca n't in good faith recommend it to you . dine at your own risk .		2		0
uhg . came here for a monday night movie and the best part was that it was empty . the bad part was the women 's bathrooms were disgusting ! why were there a bunch of people on staff and hardly any customers , but still dirty bathrooms ? also , we were seeing a movie at 9.20 pm and the times for all the theaters had n't been change since 2.30 pm that day ? is everyone sleeping at this theatre ?		2		0
our car 's driver side window was smashed as we sadly observed when we finally made our way out of this restaurant -lrb- hours later -rrb- on this less than stellar evening . . we spent yet more time cleaning glass off of the seats just to finally get to drive away from the ghetto cafe . . er barrio cafe ... but i digress . . i do n't know ... i guess a place that consistently has between an hour and 2 hour wait on a saturday and does n't take reservations has got to be beyond fabulous and worth waiting for right ? you think ? wow . . i am actually embarrased i fell for this . this must be what the people who bought charlie sheen tickets felt like ... sucker ! that is what i felt like last night for sure . first off , we had swung by here a couple of different saturdays but -lrb- smartly -rrb- decided the wait was n't worth it ... my bf really wanted to try it -lrb- be careful what you wish for -rrb- . . so we got there -lrb- early for us -rrb- around 6:45 pm last night to put our name down and do the crazy hour and 30 minute waiting game ... did i mention the bar area and patio are tiny and you get the added experience of being packed in like cows in an unorganic dairy farm ... ok . . so the food portion of the review ... two words ... mediocre and overrated ... the guacamole was salty ... i did n't get to see it prepared tableside because the restaurant was so crowded and small the server -lrb- who gets 4 personal stars because she was sweet -rrb- ... literally could n't fit the preparation cart anywhere near our table ... our main dishes ... were just ok ... nothing tasted particulary fantastic and the dining room felt hot with no air circulation ... thank goodness for the wine ... this is probably one of the loudest restaurants i have ever been to ... i was thinking no way will i be returning . . that idea was more than cemented when we saw the glass damage ... wtf ? maybe if you took reservations barrio . . and had a decent parking situation . . people would n't be sans their car for 3 hours just to eat dinner in the hood .		2		0
j. alexander 's is not normally a place i would frequent , but we had a couple of birthdays to celebrate at work and it is right across the street . so a group of about 10 of us went . i ordered the steak and fries , the steak rare , and clam chowder . the clam chowder was awesome . my steak came and it was well done . so , with these prices , i figured i should get what i asked for , so i sent it back . it came back rare alright . the first few bites were cold in the center and then it got to barely warm . not impressive at all . and honestly , i can cook a better steak than that . everyone else loved their meal , though . the service their is over the top , more than a bit too much . there are people constantly walking by , even standing and staring at your table at some point . hang on to your plate , because the moment you pause from your meal , someone is there to snatch it . i think maybe they have cameras over the tables and an observation room , `` iced tea refill , table twelve , repeat , iced tea refill table twelve , over ! '' though the wait staff did not appear to have ear-pieces , you still get the impression these are secret service wanna-be 's , ready to dive to save your dropped spoon from hitting the floor . the menu had a lot of good , but traditional , items on it , steak , salads , burgers , sandwiches , all high-end , fresh , homemade , etc. . maybe if i had ordered something else my experience might have been totally different . but , even with work picking up the tab , i managed to have a bad free meal .		2		0

poo ! i would think after my last review this place would get their s #it together ! we came here for a birthday event in mid-day saturday . no ball game , no derby , nothing was really going on sports wise ... so you would think service would be better . i want this place to succeed ! it 's a great location , the concept is fantastic , man ... the service was still horrible . the waitress at this establishment are ... . hmmmmm - trying to think of something nice . clueless . the waitresses here are cute , overwhelmed , clueless , ca n't remember anything . i would suggest just go to the bar and order everything . more than likely you 'll get what you want , your tab will correct and your food order maybe correct . still not impressed .		2		0
i have no idea how this place gets such good reviews . i went here maybe two years ago and remember it perfectly ... for all of the wrong reasons . the food was not good at all . i had the jerk chicken which tasted processed -lrb- like those frozen meals -rrb- and wayy too peppery . i love jerk season and black pepper in general , but this just was n't good . another disappointment was their black beans . they were extremely sweet -- a borderline dessert . i 'm no food snob , and definitely respect the neighborhood hole-in-the-wall restaurants , but i will definitely be staying away from this place from now on . i gave it an extra star for the awesome panda statue in the dining room .		2		0
they do a good job for a full service car wash but i hate all the upselling . i do n't really care that you will sell me a full-on detailing for half the normal price because at $ 150 that 's not all that much different than what i could pay elsewhere . once in a while i 'm willing to come in and spend $ 20 + for a full service wash that not only gets the exterior , but also includes vacuuming and cleaning of the interior . but with all the high pressure sales i 'm always reminded why i prefer to go to the self-serve places that only cost me between $ 5-7 . i 'll probably be back at some point , but definitely not on a regular basis . . and sorry dude , i 'm not spending that much to have my car detailed .		2		0
hey guys if you 're looking for a cougar -lrb- read : a sexy older sugar mama -rrb- , devil 's martini is your den . the place is filled with older women in their late 30s to late 40s on most weekend nights who are on the prowl . the music is loud , but the crowd does n't seem to care . and while the word ` martini ' is in the bar 's name , you 're still going to see a lot of people drinking beer . personally i find this bar cheesy . and parking is riddiculous on the weekend . if you 're looking for a fun dance club , try the devil 's in downtown scottsdale .		2		0
not my type of place i admit . went here for a coworkers bday party . huge place . there are three different rooms . . hip hop , country -lrb- which is the main theme here and the biggest area -rrb- and a 80 's room . the drink prices are what made the night . we were getting drinks for a buck a piece . gin and tonics for a buck , yes a buck . due to these lovely economy friendly prices i got tipsy fast and it made the night and this place a whole lot better than i think it would have been if i was sober .		2		0
i miss the days when flight attendants took pride in their appearance and were over the top nice . the flight attendants for us airways are run down and crabby . there was an older indian woman on my flight who did not speak english and they were very rude to her , it was hard to watch . it really chaps my hide that luggage is now $ 25 so i 've made adjustments in my packing to fit everything i need into two carry-ons . at least they make you aware of the fee though , what i did not know is that they now charge for meals on flights across the country . for $ 8 i got the nastiest sandwich they could throw together . they also make you recycle , which is really cool but i wanted to throw away my plastic drink cup , put my tray up and pass out but i had to wait 20 minutes because they were n't collecting plastic at that time . here 's a tip us airways , when you treat your customers like crap , it puts them in a bad mood . it 's not a good idea to put people in a bad mood when they 're cramped in a small area , surrounded by strangers and ca n't get out of their seat for 5 hours .		2		0
i came here after seeing some craigslist furniture ads with an adorable ottoman posted for sale here . first of all , i almost could n't park because the parking lot is tiny and literally right off the street . i think i almost caused an accident by braking so fast just so i would n't pass it . i walked past another antique like store -lrb- charlie 's house -rrb- and then walked into qcumberz . holy blazes was it hot in there !!! i do n't know if the ac was n't working or if they enjoy it being 95 degrees with hot air blowing around by fans but i was not impressed with that ! not once was i greeted by anyone either ... bah . the store itself is a good size but there 's just so much `` crap '' everywhere ! i think i 've learned that this kind of vintage just is n't my cup of tea . nothing struck a cord with me , just a bunch of stuff i could see at my grandma 's garage sale . i did find the ottoman i was looking for and it was so tiny ... and for $ 69 ! i was shocked how small it was ... the close up pictures really make it appear larger . and , the color on the ottoman picture was also different in person -lrb- in pictures it was green , in store it was light blue -rrb- . major disappointment ! overall , i did not like this store and would not return .		2		0
we used to come here a lot and liked it , but after a couple of so-so experiences with the food -lrb- nothing special , lots of oil , pasta drowning in too much oily sauce -rrb- we stayed away for several months . tried it again recently and it was just as bad , if not worse . disappointing because it 's a neighborhood place and we like to support family businesses , but i think a little more effort needs to be placed on the quality of the dishes . it seems like no matter what i get it 's just overly rich , too oily and bleh . also , the price on the dishes when you get a simple pasta with pesto adds up in a hurry . with wine and stuff , spending $ 100 for two ? hardly felt worth it at all for that money we could get a much better meal elsewhere . i sincerely do hope it gets better because the people are nice and the atmosphere is great !! and they do have a terrific wine selection . i think maybe the only way i 'd go back is to try the fun looking wine bar .		2		0
hello again arizonians and visitors ... . i will remind you as alway i am the pickiest person i know and detest spending good money on bad food . i am going to review salt cellar while it is fresh on my mind . i was taken here today to celebrate my b-day and i love seafood be it raw or cooked . we sat at the bar , which mind you is a very very small area and very busy with servers coming and going with drink orders . there were at least 2 bartenders that we saw and the first bartender to greet -lrb- ? -rrb- us and i use that term lightly was dale . he was quick to get our drink order and deliver it ... so far so good ... we ordered several items from the happy hour menu to include a couple of oysters on the 1/2 shell which was very tasty and a couple of oyster shooters ... yum and then on to some scallops , which unfortunately due to the very dim lighting we failed to notice were flash fried ... -lrb- why anyone would want to fry a tender and tasteful morsel of fish is beyond me -rrb- . the scallops arrived and looked unappetizing to say the least and tasted equally as unappetizing . they were tasteless to the point if i didnt know what i was eating i would never in a zillion years guess it was a scallop . my friend agreed that not only did they have a bit of a sour taste were just ... not good ! the last thing we ordered was escargot , this dish is for the folks who enjoy butter and ggarlic ... not my taste but i did try one and again ... tasteless other than the garlic taste ... i enjoy the taste of seafood and this dish did not do it for me . i must reccomend the bread , which is soft and extremely good and i was shocked that they actually charge you for bread when you are spending $ 50 in food but i will admit i was happy to pay for it . the prices are not cheap but again , i do not mind spending money on good food ... this was not it ! now on to the ambiance and service . when you enter the restaurant you have to walk down many stairs into restaurant which is underground ... very kewl concept unfortunately the moment you walk in you feel like you are in a sauna ... very hot and humid ... it overwhelms you ... especially when the temps outside are 100 plus ... . hello ... this is arizona ... use some air conditioning ! as i mentioned earlier dale was the first bardenter we saw and as efficient as he was i think he left his personality and smile at home ... he did not make us feel welcome at all . of course its possible there is some other reason he is unfriendly such as he was having a bad day , or he hated his job or ... . or ... . or ... . nope ... no or 's ... a bartender should be friendly ... i think its in the bardenter code or something . now , i am not a drinker nor do i frequent bars ... but i did years ago and bartenders used to be friendly ... isnt that how you make tips ? even if you are busy ? i had asked an employee his name and we were told he has been working there since 1986 ? i am thinking its time for mr personality to get another job . this is my opinion of salt cellar and it is because of our experience that we will not be returning . i am sure there are wonderful items on the menu that are delicious but the service and food we did try turned us off . it is my opinion if you want to spend a chunk of money on seafood try someplace else ... or not ... its your call , but until you do ... bon appetite '		2		0
i have lived in this area for 9 1/2 years and only been to jalapeno inferno once . all i ordered was a chicken quesadilla , and they could n't manage to serve it hot enough even in this sweltering heat . i kept sending it back twice ! ... it came back sun burnt ... and the waitress was n't all that nice about it ... thinking i was the problem . well , i gave you one chance ... you messed up ... i do n't feel compelled to return as i really do n't have to have your food . do n't believe the hype !		2		0
if i were grumpy today , i would give this place just one star . during our fall break , the husband and i were knocking out quite a few of the best new restaurants in phoenix magazine , and this happened to be one of them . i was pretty excited because i really like barbecue and it 's fun to compare different places . unfortunately , this place did n't compare to any other bbq place . i honestly thought it was terrible , almost to the point of being inedible . the restaurant itself is pretty cute . i love the old western movies playing , the decor is rustic and cute , and its very clean inside . unfortunately , it must have been a really really really off day for them , especially considering the raves from deb -lrb- and i trust her reviews . -rrb- i ordered the beef brisket with a side of the cowboy olive cole slaw . it sounded fascinating . before our meal arrived i got some extra bbq sauce , and that was the first indicator that this would be no good for me . honestly , the sauce tasted like hot sauce with a little bit of ketchup in it . it was really watery , and i like really thick sauces . i just really hated the flavor . my brisket was terribly dry and overcooked . there was no falling apart as i cut it , mostly just sawing motions to get through the nearly 1/2 inch slab . i think brisket should be cut much thinner than that . fortunately , there was a decent smokey flavor that was present , and that made my meat palatable . i figured the cole slaw would be better . it was n't . it really just tasted like someone emptied a can of olive juice into a generic batch of cole slaw . the only thing worth eating here was the baked potato salad , but it was n't my side dish to eat . this place was a big ol let down for me . like i said , this must have been a really bad day for them , because i do n't think you win one of the best new restaurant spots for nothing .		2		0
after reading a few reviews , i 'm beginning to wonder if i even dined in the same place as some of you ? upon entering i got a strangely reminiscent feeling that i 'd been here before ... ... aaahhh yes i 've got it ... ... palatte is the reincarnation of the hippie commune called the `` brotherhood '' that i was born in/at . seriously ! my dad delivered me in a room full of hippies . i ca n't believe no one has mentioned this kind of correlation . i 'm really surprised that everyone was n't barefoot . the staff scuttled around like drones , i saw flowers , feathers and grizzly beards . this is definitely not what i expected . you order at the counter , take a number , sit on chairs that might fall apart , at tables older than your great grandma . food is dropped off , that 's it . there is no `` service '' here . you get ? if your into the whole hippie dippie , artsy fartsy , grandmas yard sale garden type of feel then you will most likely enjoy it here , not to say that i did n't enjoy it , i was just picturing something completely different and felt mildly out of place , so there for i was disappointed in that aspect . the food , it was good not spectacular , no oooing and aaaahing over every bite . i got the potato mish mash -lrb- scrambled eggs with potato , bacon , spinach , caramelized sweet onion , gouda and monterrey jack -rrb- with the raisin , cranberry walnut toast and fresh fruit . -lrb- see pics -rrb- the eggs were a little wet , but over all had a good flavor , toast was good , fruit was soggy browned apple slices , not so good ! my ice tea was cinnamon apple flavor ? ... ... i wish i would have known ... ... not very good for ice tea . my husband got the dolores -lrb- with no salsa -rrb- two fried eggs , corn tortillas , black beans , queso fresco and avocado . it was also just ok , the eggs were cooked over hard , the beans were dry and the cheese was in unmelted chunks . his oj was fresh squeezed and sweet that was nice , too bad it was served in a very small child 's glass . ok food , needs to work on a better system , should have waiter service , if you eat outside most tables are coffee table height so you will be hunching over , other than that i guess it 's all about the charm . peace and love !		2		0
today i went there for dinner . boy , the quality drop significantly . the fish was bad . the rice was bad . after all this time , : -lrb- i guess its time to start looking for new sushi place .		2		0
not worth the price . i would not go back . pretty unexciting .		2		0
after a couple of technical complications early in their operation , i 've been back a few times and always come to the same conclusion : go for the drinks , not the food . at first i thought , `` maybe i 'm just in a bitchy mood and it 's throwing my taste buds off . '' but i 've gone with different people and been mostly in a chipper mood so that was n't it . then i thought i was ordering odd items off the menu , but i 've tried a variety of items from the brunch and dinner menus and come to the same conclusion . finally , i decided hula 's is an awesome place to get a great cocktail . it 's just meh on the food side . hula 's definitely has one cool patio , amazing architectural features and mighty friendly staff . i just can negate the eating experiences to provide a better rating . it wo n't be my last time here , so i 'm hoping i can update with a more sparkly review .		2		0
`` it is better to look good , than to serve good ... '' first of all , the burgers are very good . i ordered mine medium , and that 's how it actually arrived . not many places will actually cook a burger to order . maybe they say they will , but no . the fries -lrb- both sweet potato and regular -rrb- were tasty . so no real complaints about the food . but ... come on sam fox ... you ca n't just put model-looking women out there as servers and hostesses , have them take far too long to seat us because they could n't figure out which tables were open , deny that a special was being offered -lrb- until i showed the email for it on my phone -rrb- , have them take 10 minutes or so to bring a glass of wine , delay a simple food order by about 20 minutes or so , repeatedly neglect water and drink refills , forget that the burger was ordered without a bun , and expect customers not to notice because they 've been blinded by an abundance of voluptuary feminine goodness . i 've gotten better service at actual stripjoints that served food . so , not really a fan . maybe caught them on a bad night -lrb- though the tuesday night crowd did n't seem like it would have been too imposing -rrb- . i might give them another chance , but then if i 'm paying $ 11 for a burger ala carte , basically everything needs to be perfect to convince me to go back . smashburger and 5 guys are just down the street , and i 'd rather not pay for the pretention of service .		2		0
not worth it ! i was n't expecting to have to fork over so much cash . luckily we had half priced tickets . if we ended up paying the full $ 12 just to get in the doors then pay an outrageous amount at each of the vendors , i would have been even more upset . the only plus was , i had some amazing tacos . but , that 's it . we will definitely not be going next year .		2		0
$ 7 for a small styrofoam bowl of bland white mush atop rice . can you tell i am less than thrilled and my negativity only grows with my hunger just 2 hours after my `` meal . '' it was another food truck friday in down town phoenix , the number of trucks grew since last year and hey joe was one the new ones to me . from glazing at the menu the only veggie option was the vegan mungo for $ 7 so i went for it . it came in a small white styrofoam bowl , looking anemic , like babaganoush with a few leaves of spinach . i was hoping for more flavor , but it was not there . the texture was like a indian lentil dish . why was this $ 7 it should have been 3.50 at most . sure it came from a truck with modern graphics on it , this does not mean it is instantly gold . trucks may be trendy but so far the food quality has yet to impress me .		2		0
i went with two friends to china chili for lunch this afternoon . it was very meh . i had the chicken salad -lrb- chicken breast , lettuce , cilantro with hot mustard and sesame oil -rrb- and a side of white rice . it was very bland . if it had hot mustard and sesame oil on it , i totally missed it . the rice was n't cooked well at all ... seriously , wtf ? the soup that came out beforehand was nothing to write home about . my two dining companions had the tofu and said it was not very filling at all and that is was just ok . the lunch menu is not very large and to me seems to be quite lacking in some staple chinese dishes that you would expect . the prices were pretty standard for a chinese restaurant . thankfully service was fast and pleasant .		2		0
went here for a business lunch because true foods had to long a wait . menu was a decent lunch selection but service was very slow , although it was not crowded . the burgers and fries looked good but my order was messed up and in the interest of te and since it was a business lunch i could n't send it back . however when you ask for no dressing on a salad and balsamic vinegar on the side it 's a pretty basic request and you should not get a salad soaked in sweet calories filled dressing . boo on this place . too many other choices in the quarter to return .		2		0
wow . i used to love this place ! the desserts are now terrible . the foccacia that i was addicted to is now identical to the packaged pizza mix made by hamburger helper . the chicken soup noodles were n't cooked . the only thing that is still good is the salad bar itself . for the price , i 'm going back to souper salad !		2		0
meh . it 's okay if you like your pizza crust soggy . i 've been several times before and the crust has always been soggy . on my most recent visit i asked them to bake the crust longer to make it crispy . it was soggy again . please note one point of caution regarding the other reviews of this restaurant . this place may be quicker to get into , but it is most definitely not anywhere near the caliber of pizzeria bianco . would every pizza chef in town who has a james beard award please raise their hand ? on march 18th i received this message from karen martingilio : dear ted , thanks for giving us a couple of tries , everyone has their opinion about what they like in a pizza , in italy they use a knife and fork , we make our crust more soft and chewy more italian style , and that does not appeal to everyone , however to imply that our other reviewers are just coming to us because the wait is shorter , or that we take less pride in our product then others is somewhat mean spirited , i m sure you didn t intend to insult our dedicated chef or our restaurant but unfortunately it could be misinterpeted by other yelpers , you are intitled to your opinion and so are our fans on yelp , thanks again for your imput , karen martingilio yelpers , as karen notes above , i am entitled to my opinion . her email does not change my opinion in any way .		2		0
i wish i could give this place five stars , i really do . i 've been to all vegan -lrb- this place is no , but is close -rrb- chinese restaurants in ny , philly and boulder , and was hoping that this would be similar . it took us three tries to even get to eat here , as they have odd hours to start with , and seemed to be closed sometimes when their sign said that they should be open . the first time , we were the only people in the whole place , and it still took us 45 minutes to get served , and another 20 from when we were done until we could get our check . the second visit , there were other people there , but there were more servers , and it took , no kidding , over an hour to even get our soup . an hour . our tea pot and water glasses were empty long before that . the food ? it 's ok . it 's not amazing , but as a vegetarian , it 's nice to know that you can eat anything on a menu . the mushroom hot pot was ok but a little bland . i liked the steamed dumplings , but the sauce was a bit odd . do n't forget the odd tvs all around the place playing interesting cult-like clips about supreme master ching hai and his biddings . which is kinda cool to begin with , but when you 're sitting there for an hour or two , it gets a bit old . i really wanted to like this place , but i ca n't . we wo n't be going back unless they get a big overhaul .		2		0
sakana is another typical sushi place . i was n't blown away , nor do i feel that the quality of fish justified the expense . it 's a small place and we requested the first available seats ; after 10 minutes we were seated at the sushi bar . our chairs backed up to the kitchen entrance , which was literally two feet away . i distinctly remember watching a basketball game during this meal , since the tvs are right in front of your face at the sushi bar . it took forever just to get water . by the time we ordered happy hour was over and we had to pay full price . we put the order in and each roll came out at least five minutes a part . the fish was not really fresh -- it looked like it had been sitting in the cooler for too long . after we had been finished for 15 minutes another roll they 'd forgotten about came out . we were full . the sushi chef let us know : `` no worries , someone else will order it soon '' , as he placed it on top of the cooler to sit ... and sit ... i usually go into detail about each item i order , but it was so nondescript i practically forgot what we had by the time we got to the car .		2		0
my boyfriend and i love vietnamese food and were in downtown phx for first friday , we saw this place and figured we 'd give it a go . first of all , they clearly have an underage drinking problem as we had to get wristbands in order to drink any alcohol . strange at a restaurant . the dj was spinning decent music , but he was not a good dj in terms of skills . kept fucking up transitions - i thought serato made that shit easy ? anyway , we 're seated right away , but for a good 10 - 15 min . no one brings us any water or acknowledges us . finally we flag someone down and just go ahead and put our orders in . it seriously takes like another 5 minutes just to bring us water . it was busy at the bar , but the dining area itself was not packed , mind you . my boyfriend orders pho , i order a pork vermicelli dish of some sort , something i get often at viet places . i request peanut sauce instead of the fish sauce , because , well , i fucking love peanut sauce . i will seriously bathe in that stuff . if i see something has peanut sauce in it , i will order it solely for that reason . so anyway , i make this clear to the server . our food comes out at a reasonable pace , but i receive fish sauce . i kindly ask for peanut sauce , and the server alerts me it 's going to be 15 minutes before i can get peanut sauce . wait , hold up . you 're a vietnamese restaurant that is out of peanut sauce !? that has literally never happened to me . and i frequent vietnamese places a lot . i luh me some noodles and whatnot . i said fine , i 'll wait for the peanut sauce and use hoisin sauce in the meantime . 15-20 min . go by and i remind our server i am still waiting . he disappears and comes back to let me know that they are out of it for the evening . so , you lied initially ? alrighty then . i guess you thought i would n't want it because of the wait ? did i mention i worship the peanut sauce god ? should 've just been honest in the first place . although , dude , vietnamese restaurants do n't run out of peanut sauce . c'mon now . the food itself was mediocre . my noodles were cooked beyond al dente and my boyfriend told me his pho was mediocre as well . prices were about average for that type of food and the servers were nice , plus location is great for people watching , hence it 's 2 stars instead of 1 . overall , if something stood out here i would 've mentioned it and given it a better rating . however , a very bland and irritating experience overall . especially when pho motha fuckin ' thanh is not far away on 17th ave and camelback and is far , far more awesome . cheaper prices and better food . and they have an endless supply of peanut sauce . amen .		2		0
we stopped in here tonight to grab some kona coffee ice cream draped in hot fudge and there were a few issues , so i 'm deducting one star . 1 -rrb- they had a small acoustic group performing that was 70 's wonderful but they were so loud we literally had to scream our orders to the staffer . 2 -rrb- the staffer was either new , or short bus special , because we had to tell him that the whole point of ordering a sundae was to get the toppings -lrb- he did n't offer and i was n't paying $ 5.25 for two scoops of ice cream -rrb- . 3 -rrb- the previously larger than life scoops have experienced significant shrinkage . they really are n't even normal size scoops anymore . 4 -rrb- some how my $ 5.25 sundae came out to $ 6.27 after tax . i know az is experiencing a budget crisis , but there is no way that taxes have gone up that much , so i must conclude that i was overcharged . 5 -rrb- the place was so full of zpizza customers listening to the music that there was literally nowhere to sit , unless we went to the noticeably empty pizza side . the result was not only a complete invasion of my personal space -lrb- i simply do n't like rubbing up against strangers just to get to the counter unless i 'm at a bar -rrb- but it also created a really strange odor comprised of pepperoni and sugar ... far from appetizing . all in all , the visit was a complete disappointment - but the band was great .		2		0
back in the mid-nineties , studio-apartment-dwelling , student-loan-burdened me would come here and get great deals on things like ecco shoes , kenneth cole shirts , fashionable jeans , and other things i never could have afforded new from nordstrom 's . sometimes the condition was questionable , but the price always reflected that . i wore out several pairs of high-line shoes purchased here for $ 11 - $ 12 . those days are long gone . now , ca n't find a pair of shoes here for less than $ 30 . the clothes are picked over . and mainly , going there is an opportunity for me to bump into the future ex-mrs . bill b. , or perhaps the exit strategy from the current prospective mrs. bill b. because if you 're looking for young or not-quite-so-young-anymore shoppers in 5-inch heels , miniskirts and too much make-up , this is a great place to find them . just do n't offer to buy them shoes . anymore . these days .		2		0
i 've given this place two tries . i forgot how `` bleh '' it was the first time and tried it again . still bleh . `` country potatoes '' are almost without flavor at all . i had the spicy mexican skillet the first time . fairly tasty , but nothing about it wowed me . i had the greek omelet this time , and it again failed to stimulate the taste buds . a little over-done on the outside , and nothing overly tasty about the overall presentation . i left half of it on the plate , along with most of the potatoes . i ca n't recommend this place at all .		2		0
the ambience is a feast for the eyes and for the touch , this much is true , but one is paying a very high price for this exclusivity . while i liked waiting in the lobby - could n't sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner service at 5:30 p - i did notice that for a venue that strives to project a life of luxury , housekeeping had n't come by to clean food debris off of the coffee table -lrb- closest to the sushi restaurant 's host desk -rrb- . not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sitting on the table and asked me if i had wanted anything from the bar - she had to have noticed the mess ?! i ordered a $ 9.50 spider roll -lrb- soft-shelled crab -rrb- , a $ 10 veggie tempura app , and a $ 19 baked lobster roll , all priced at 50 % for one week during their 1-year anniversary . they 're all good , and factoring in the ostentatious surroundings , i 'd pay $ 9.50 for the soft-shelled crab roll , but i 'd put my foot down on the other two . 50 % maybe , but $ 19 for a five-piece lobster roll ? yes , it was very tasty , and yes , the cream sauce was orgasmic , but for $ 19 , i expect moments from the restaurant scenes of `` the ugly truth '' or `` when harry met sally , '' take your pick . if you 've money to burn or have someone else paying for the bill , then this is your sushi stop near old town scottsdale .		2		0
last night a few of us wanted to go out and have dinner and drinks . after hitting up a few spots , we ended up here because most places were packed due to the ufc fight going on . even though i 'm a regular at chandler fashion center , i 've never eaten at majerle 's . figured we may as well check it out , and , well , i was kind of let down some . when we entered , the place was packed . not only because it was saturday night , but the ufc fight was going on , so there was a million people in this place . the hostess asked if we were here for the fight or not , as it would determine where they would seat us . we told her that we were not here to watch the fight , so she seated us outside . that was fine by us , since it was mostly empty on the patio . our waitress was okay , but she mostly forgot about us during the evening . she was nice and all that , but we never got our drinks refilled , and i had to go ask the hostess to find her because we had waited what seemed like an eternity to get our bill . its never a good sign when you have to ask the hostess for drinks and your bill . i was dissappointed with the service here because i kind of expected more . some could argue that it was a busy saturday night with a ufc fight going on , but the server dam near forgot about us . she even walked by our table at one point and after i tried to get her attention , she never saw or heard me calling for her , and kept on walking ! fail !! i mean , i guess the big bucks were inside watching the fight ... blah . i do n't know that i will be back again , but for a sports bar , its actually kind of nice . just do n't expect to much for service when going here .		2		0
i went here for happy hour at 5:30 pm on a thursday and it was n't too crowded . we sat outside which was a mistake because it was so loud with all the bikes across the street . the drinks were just ok , and the brie appetizer was kind of a joke . only served with 3 small pieces of bread ? most people order appetizers for at least 2 . we asked for more and they brought it out free of charge . the service however was great so that kind of made up for the mediocre drinks and appetizer .		2		0
maybe i have n't been to dos gringos in a while , or maybe this location is just grosser than the tempe location , but this place is dirty ! the bathroom has a bad smell coming from it and everything just seems kinda filthy . i would never ever order food from here , if their bar area is this dirty i can only imagine how gross the kitchen is ... i 'm not really sure why people would hang out here when there are plenty of nicer and more fun spots in scottsdale .		2		0
i ca n't really comment on the food since all we ordered was chips with queso and salsa which we did n't really eat due to the excessive amount of salt in all three . however , they had a surprisingly decent selection of beer on tap so the hubby and i spent an enjoyable afternoon day drinking on the patio and taking advantage of the happy hour half price drafts . we sat at the bar since the hostess informed us that there was a wait for tables on the patio even though there were a couple empty ones and i did n't see anyone waiting . even from the bar we had good people watching opportunities courtesy of the shoppers below , no less than three tvs to watch , and a view of the acoustic guitar singer who started playing shortly after we arrived . on a sunday afternoon it was mostly families and couples just hanging out . but i get the feeling that this place makes most of its money from rowdy college kids in the evenings . since that is not my scene and i did n't see anything too appetizing on the menu or coming out of the kitchen , i doubt we 'll be back . but i had to give them that extra star for the awesome patio and local craft brews . too bad they allow smoking out there , but again i guess i am not their target demographic .		2		0
the company my wife works at had a christmas party at casa paloma @ el chorro . neither my wife , nor i , were impressed . the food is perhaps not what we like . food was a little too plain , and little too run of the mill , for us .		2		0
finally got to try five guys ! i do n't know what the hype is all about but i thought it was okay . the burgers were okay but i 've had far better burgers at plenty of other places . i got it with bbq sauce and wish i had just chose plain ol mayo . the fries were alright . the cajun spice lacked flavor , though . you can taste the cajun seasoning but it was missing some salt or something . dunking them in ketchup helped . i wish they had ranch : -rrb- it 's slightly pricy for what it is . $ 12 for a bacon cheeseburger , small fries and drink . i think $ 8-9 would be more like it .		2		0
we were excited to casablanca for date night , as we loved it when it was the estate house . we arrived a bit early for our 7:30 pm reservations and were led outside , past all of the cozy seats inside . i thought it odd we were n't asked for a preference . but wait -- it got worse . we were also taken past all of the cozy couches outside facing the movie playing and seated at this strange area way in the back . between our two chairs , which overlooked the street , we had a giant heater and small table -lrb- in may -rrb- . so much for date night . -lrb- the light-up menus are totally cool , though the selection is small . -rrb- but wait -- it still gets worse . apparently our corner was the smoking area -lrb- !? -rrb- , so they actually seated me , a severe asthmatic , in the middle of it . thanks . we ordered a crab dip , the sliders and the tacos . while waiting , we did get our well-mixed drinks . but then our waiter totally disappeared . after 35 minutes a water guy apologized for our slow food service . after 45 minutes it finally appeared . the two pork dishes were ok -- but served totally lukewarm . the tacos were beautifully plated ; the limes even had perfect grill marks on them . but could n't they put that much care into getting me my damn food in a timely manner ? while it 's still hot ? we did n't care for the crab dip , but that could be a personal thing . the plantain chips were yummy . the final rub came with the service . our waiter literally never came back after taking our order . when we decided we had enough , we actually went inside and stood at the empty bar and asked for our tab . interestingly , no one thought that was odd . so there we go . bad service , mediocre food . we wo n't be back .		2		0
as you might be able to tell from my schizophrenicly changing stars for this place , my experiences have varied . some things that do not ever change , with my latest experience in parentheses : - they seem to carry only the tastiest wines . -lrb- pascual toso reserve malbec ' 08 -rrb- - their cheeses are also amazingly amazing . -lrb- american plate w / buzzed from utah and a perfectly aged gouda -rrb- - their food is great . -lrb- lasagna -rrb- however , - the kitchen ran out of pizza , mac & cheese -lrb- which is what i wanted -rrb- , and lasagna -lrb- luckily i made the cut -rrb- . that 's easily half their menu ! we subsequently had to change our orders twice as the bad news kept rolling in . by the end of the night our poor server was like the angel of death since each time i saw him i got nervous that he was going to come tell me that whatever it was i had ordered was yet again 86ed . - then the food that we were able to order took over 45 minutes to show up . - then the reverse happy hour cocktails were inconsistent -lrb- different colored pomegranate margaritas , one pineapple cosmo that tasted great , but a 2nd that had a coffee flavor - which they gladly replaced for a good tasting one -rrb- . overall i ended up paying way too much for a lackluster experience . what really peeved me off was that i had recommended this place to our party of 14 , with the hope that i could show them how awesome places in cenpho are , since they 're all suburbanites . so thank you cheuvront , for making me look like a fool and giving my friends one more reason to stay in the ` burbs : -lrb-		2		0
they lied . the tacos were not half price , even though that is what it said on the wall and on the menu . nope . we were charged full price and 6 little tacos , although tasty , are not worth $ 15 . when i asked the bartender what the deal was , he said they got rid of that deal . i pointed to the wall , and he says , `` yeah , i know . '' and that was it . plus , a fight broke out behind us and it was n't even 8pm -lrb- we were there for happy hour -rrb- . entertaining if they would have let it go on , but the guys were so drunk they could barely swing . -lrb- heavy on the sarcasm -rrb- . we used to go here a bunch a few years ago , but now it 's just bad cougars and people that like to fight . awesome for some , but not for me .		2		0
us airways sucks . unfortunately , they 're often the cheapest alternative to destinations i need to go for work . i ca n't believe they charge significantly more for a window or aisle seat in the front half of the plane . just a damn insult . add the unreliable schedule and you 're in for a real treat . at least they have n't crashed with me on board , yet .		2		0
we ended up visiting this restaurant one day , after our barista at starbucks mentioned how the patrons at her ` other job ' were n't tipping well , forcing her to hold an alternate vocation at the coffee giant . so we show up later that evening . anyways , the decor is rustic but outdated . the menu is limited , and you have no options . `` what do you mean by no options '' , you ask ? what type of salad dressing would you like ? ranch ? not a fan of ranch ? are you sure ? because that 's all they have to serve with their cheap iceburg salad mix . and to spice things up a bit , they throw in a few whole cherry tomatoes . and do you like corn on the cob , and diced sweet potatoes sauteed in butter and brown sugar ? i hope so , because that 's all you gon na get . sound appetizing ? sweet and buttery concoctions making their way across the plate toward your meaty centerpiece . my wife ordered the ` deputy ' prime rib , which was the most un-flavorful piece of meat she recalls having , and the au-jus being just warmed beef broth , void of flavor . i ordered the ` trail hand ' t-bone , because i like t-bones . you should just call me ` t-bone ' . anyways , i asked them to serve it rare , because i had a hankering for a juicy cut of steak . it was incredibly bland , and destitute of the juice i craved . it was n't dry . more like a raw piece of steak . wanting to salvage the evening , i scanned the dessert menu for a hidden gem . strike three . the apple pie we chose was unanimously nominated for the worst ever . the dough was either overkneaded , or cooked in a microwave . kind of stretchy . a few bites into this , and we knew ... prognosis negative . this review gets 2 stars , with one of those stars coming from the entertainment . yes , the one bright spot was the live music . the band sounded great . this trip turned out to be a complete waste of money that would have been better served back at the seattle conglomerate .		2		0
i guess my expectations were a bit too high for such an expensive place . we made reservations for our anniversary dinner . in general , my dining experiences surround casual dining establishments . low key , relaxed atmosphere , friendly wait staff , the type of place that will stop for a minute or two to have a conversation instead of go through a check list . serve bread , bring water , fork on the left , soup spoon above the plate , ask about appetizers , talk about specials , etc. , etc. . i got the feeling that this was a stuffed shirt type of place , and while i * was * wearing a tie that evening , i was n't expecting a by the book , average service with our $ 50 meals . where to begin ? i hate that this is basically going to be a check list of everything that went wrong , but here goes . - requested olive oil for the table bread which took about 15 minutes to arrive . - the drinks we ordered took 20 + minutes to arrive . - wifes steak was n't cooked to order . the waiter asked if she wanted it butterflied to be sure it was cooked to order , she said yes . it was not butterflied and started bleeding when she cut into it . - we ordered a side of brussel sprouts that did n't actually come out with the meal . - i had to remind the waiter that we did n't get our brussel sprouts - the sautéed brussel sprouts and bacon tasted mediocre and came with crunchy bacon bits , not bacon - i 've had way better and for a lot less $ $ . - the steamed vegetables -lrb- a carrot and snow peas by the way -rrb- went through more of a blanching than a steaming and were basically raw veggies . - option of baked potato , mashed potato , and potato au gratin as your included side , how much potato do you think i eat ? - run of the mill steak house music playing over the speaker system . my expectations were that i would get an amazingly delicious meal , nice friendly evening , perhaps some live ambiance music , a waiter who remembered what we ordered without a reminder , and service that happened a bit faster . i understand that kitchen problems are n't the fault of the wait staff , but i assumed at the cost of these meals , the waiter staff would notice a missing side dish , and a steak that was n't butterflied . if you care to know , yes we did mention the foul ups with the food order , they did comp the brussel sprouts , they did cook the steak a bit longer , the manager came to the table to apologize , and we did receive complimentary desserts . although the desserts were complimentary because of our anniversary and not the foul ups ; not that i was fishing for free stuff . i certainly appreciate the apologies and effort put in to correcting what went wrong . i was generally expecting a * nice * place like this to be on their game the entire night and was soured by the overall experience . donovan 's sure knows how to make a special evening , well , not so special .		2		0
dear mr. bianco , i am writing this to bring your attention to the rudeness of your hostess that was working 2/19/11 . if you have more than 1 hostess let me narrow it down for you , short dark hair and glasses . i myself am a business owner and no matter how great your product is , amazing customer service is also an integral part of the the overall experience . i have dined at your establishment twice and both time the food was delicious even if the wait was long . back to the night at hand . my boyfriend and i stopped by after dining elsewhere in hopes of grabbing a pie to enjoy the next day . we were holding the door open for those that were exiting , those that were being ushered in to their seats and those that were putting their name on the waiting list . when there was a lull said hostess says `` yes ? '' not , `` how may i help you ? '' or `` hi '' or anything that could be construed as gracious , friendly , hostessish . my boyfriend states that we were looking to get a pizza to go . miss crab-apple , my new moniker for her , states , no haughtily sniffs , `` we do n't do orders to go when there are people waiting . '' then she turns and walks away . she does n't even ask us if we want to put our names down for a table . mr. bianco we did n't know what your kitchen 's policy is for takeout , maybe you should have a sign that is in huge letters right on the door : no takeout while others wait ! i am sure that would clear it up for those of us that simply wanted to spend our money on your food , just not eat it there . thank you for your time , d'lisa shayn		2		0
i went here with the expectation that it would like your run of the mill vegas buffet , but i was wrong . it was sooo much worse . this place is definitely those looking for quantity over quality . we went for `` seafood night . '' this consists of badly tasting lobster claws , gross oysters , mediocre crab legs , etc. . i was extremely disappointed in the seafood selection especially knowing that all of the other restaurants in this casino have amazing seafood . all of the other food choices were mediocre at best . the deserts were not very good either . even though there was a big selection i could n't find a single one i liked . meanwhile , i was with a diabetic who only picked the `` sugar free '' options . *** warning *** they are not sugar free . his blood sugar spiked as soon as he left . a very scary thing to mislabel . overall , not an enjoyable experience and will not be back .		2		0
ate dinner here for the first time a couple of days ago . combo dinner w / green chilli . no draft mex beers . ok food just not the kind of mexican food i like . i like my corn chips covered with salt , hot and greasy , like they just came out of a boiling vat of lard . theirs were the kind of generic chips you can get anywhere . rest of the food was average . i lucked out and got a very good waitress who checked on my table often . the atmosphere was kinda of weird . the painted celling made me think of aphrodite 's palace in `` my big fat greek wedding '' . anyway they got really busy about the time i was leaving so they are doing something right . just not a place i will make a regular stop .		2		0
this was my first experience at this particular ra . i left the restaurant thinking about how horrible the service was , but giving it the usual `` but maybe it was just a bad night there '' . but , from reading the other reviews , i 'd have to say it 's a bad night there every night . we went on a friday night at 6pm , so i expected it to be busy ... but it actually was n't too bad . there were about 5 empty tables indoors , and we sat at one of the 3 empty tables on the back patio . it took the server about 15 minutes to acknowledge our existence , and only after we went to the bartender to ask for drinks . i have to give the guy credit though , he was pleasant the whole time . as we were getting to the end of our meal , the patio was getting more and more crowded , which means that there were more and more people standing -lrb- very close to our table , which makes me a little uncomfortable -rrb- . we had saki bombers , edemame , shrimp tempura , and california rolls . the edemame was good - my first attempt at this appetizer . california rolls , which are usually my favorite , were rolled very loosely which made each one fall apart when picked up with the chop sticks . bummer .		2		0
was this place a chuck e cheese before ? i tested arcadia tavern out for a mid-week happy hour and it was wall to wall kids . little kids . this is not what i am looking for when i roll to a bar at the end of the day to booze-kill my horrible work week . it 's clearly their aim , however , as every table contained at least two kids and they have wiis and toys set up in a back area of the restaurant for them . legos and blocks flying all over the place . they serve the draught beer in these absurdly oversized heavy margarita glasses . i had to hold my glass with both hands just like the toddlers all around me . i ordered chicken strips which i am positive came frozen from costco . a friend ordered the bruschetta board , the presentation of which was pretty awful but clearly a blatant rip on postino . i tried their salami and pesto -lrb- sounds familiar -rrb- and the mascarpone and prosciutto , neither was very impressive . the server was forgetful and rather dotty , doing things like taking two out of three drink orders and suddenly walking away . i could n't get out of there fast enough .		2		0
after hearing for years that this is theeee best breakfast in town i finally checked it out . now i 've been twice , and i just do n't get it . i just found nothing special about this place at all . it 's a cute breakfast dinner and the pancakes and waffles are ... well , pancakes and waffles . both times i 've been we had to wait to be seated , and both times i did n't feel it was worth it . in my opinion palette , over easy and matt 's big breakfast are so much better . of course your mileage may vary .		2		0
we went to olive & ivy for our third time a couple weeks ago with friends . each experience has been different , and i must say that this place needs to make up its mind . is it a trendy nighttime dining establishment or a casual grocery cafe ? i prefer the latter , although the restaurant seems to punish me for it . granted there are great menu selections and the food has been reliably good . but the prices are high , the service mediocre , and the interior design more fitting of a vegas night club . i would never make this a first choice , although i also try not to complain if dragged there .		2		0
listen , i could have danced here ... the night i went i thought the dj was actually spinning pretty well . we danced a little bit but i kept getting weird looks from the collar-popped meat heads next to us -lrb- who were n't dancing -rrb- . their looks were saying to me , `` you mean you 're dancing ... without a female ass parked up in your crotch ? what the hell are you doing ?! '' douchyness abounds . ck1 is heavy in the air . drinks are expensive and even though we had bottle service , our waitress was over at the other table flirting most of the time . oh , and she did n't know how to make anything .		2		0
food was decent , not too sure how this place is getting such rave reviews though ... probably the most expensive mexican place of it 's style . $ 25 for a burro , two tostadas , and two mini-tacos . seriously ?! also , no free refills or chips/salsa . are we going back ? no .		2		0
the only thing saving this place was the bruschetta ! it was delicious , and i 'm really a sucker for the stuff ... after seeing all of the good reviews , i was really excited to try this place . we walk in late saturday evening a couple of weeks ago without a reservation -lrb- god forbid ! -rrb- and get attitude from the hostess who looked me up and down right when we walked in . `` uhm , i think we will be able to get out you in . do you want to sit outside ? '' anyways , we got a small , cozy table in the corner which is my favorite ! our server was fine , nothing to complain about , but he really did n't do anything to make an impression . i ordered lasagna , and i was really pumped for it . but then i almost spit out the first bite ! it tasted like overcooked , processed spaghetti-o 's ! the pasta was n't right , the sauce was dreadful and watery , and the spices seemed like they were only trying to cover up the horrible attempt at lasagna . disgusting . my boyfriend liked his entree , but we agreed we would n't want to go back . if you go , make a reservation and do not get the lasagna .		2		0
drinking + arcade games . this should be an obvious winner , right ? wrong . oh , how wrong . eating here is like eating in a casino , only less classy and with worse food . beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event . those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea , until it 's 45 minutes later , you 're out of points , you 're nowhere near drunk and you 've already spent $ 40 . if you go late , try not to get syphilis when you walk by san felipe 's .		2		0
i was really surprised to see that this placed had 4.5 stars , which was why we tried it . the food was not good and the fish did not even seem fresh . i would not recommend this to anyone . do n't be fooled by the reviews .		2		0
pretty good little bar with some good beer selections and a decent selection of snacks . as far as the restaurant itself , its so so . not exactly sure what identity they are trying to go for food-wise but its nothing to rave about .		2		0
i have a love , hate relationship with buffalo wild wings . the food is good , but for the most part it 's location near the harkins theater make it a disaster to find parking or to consider going to as a restaurant . that said , we 've been coming here for over four years and have tried most items on the menu . at it 's core , bww is a beer and chicken place . our family loves the chicken tenders over the bone-in wings . no reason , just our preference . if you have n't been to a bww , please know they have over a dozen sauces , from the very mild -lrb- no heat -rrb- to mouth searing hot . we really like the asian zing -lrb- medium -rrb- and mango habanero -lrb- hot -rrb- . also , their salads are very good . bww has a large bar area which can get very crowded and a huge dinning room for families or large groups . if you want to watch a game , this is the place . they have a dozen or so big screens . btw , buffalo wild wings runs specials on tuesday -lrb- wings -rrb- and thursdays -lrb- boneless -rrb- . enjoy !		2		0
well this place could definitely use a facelift . the service was super slow and unmemorable . at least the food was pretty good , but i can think of a handful of other family owned mexican restaurants that are much better . my boyfriend did n't like his meal of a taco and chile relleno , i believe . glad i gave it a try , but probably wo n't be back .		2		0
for valentine 's day , i wanted to get my friend something a little nice to celebrate the day so went to karsh 's . how many times do you celebrate someones 89th valentines day . i walked in and looked at the cases . i hear laughing in the back . i walked around and looked at all the cases again.i saw the asst manager look through the window to see if someone was out there . i looked through all the cases twice more and walked out and went to bashas . maybe they do n't like me there ? a week later i went to buy some marbled rye bread there because did n't have the time to go to lagrande orange . two people immediately asked to help me . this place does something to my head . i wish i could like the idea of going there . i do n't but do so for my friend only now .		2		0
gross ! bland deli meat on bland sub bread with bland toppings . was it food ? yes . so i guess it requires stars .		2		0
my order of spinach and artichoke dip with chips at cooperstown : -- amount of dip : george bush 's popularity at the end of his presidency . -- number of chips : barack obama 's current popularity . that 's one disappointing appetizer . when i tried to request more `` george bush popularity , '' i was told i would have to order an entirely new plate , because `` george bush popularity '' has to be made fresh . lame political metaphors aside , my saturday night experience at downtown 's `` other '' theme restaurant was blah . the corn beef on my sandwich was tough . the waitress , while extremely friendly , forgot to bring my table 's silverware . we had to ask for the utensils after receiving our sandwiches . at least the water glasses were kept full most of the time . last night 's experience at cooperstown is demonstrative of most of my experiences at this restaurant . just ok . the prices at this restaurant , however , lead one to expect `` good . '' a better execution of this restaurant 's menu and improved service would lead to my adding a third star in the future .		2		0
well , i stood at the bar for 15min with a menu in my hand wanting to order carry out but though the bartender came my way several times , once even completing a carry out order for a guy standing right next to me , i was never acknowledged . at one point , a woman who also wanted carry out who came in after me , went and sat at the bar & was promptly greeted . this is where my patience ran out an i walked out . suddenly , a guy who must have been a manager came out of the restaurant asking if i was there for carry out to which i responded `` i wanted to order but i 'm over it now . '' he politely offered to take my order himself which i appreciated but he had to have seen me to know that i was leaving without being helped and after i 'm halfway to the car is too late ...		2		0
i needed a dress for a costume party and i thought last chance would be a great place to get a cheap-o dress ... and it was ! but , not without a few issues ... so , little naive me wandered down to last chance five minutes before they opened thinking i could just hang out and play some words with friends until a nice sales associate unlocked the door for me . no way , jose ! there were about 50 - 70 middle aged eager shoppers crammed up ready for the doors to open ! this is like black friday !! every day ! this is insane !! i almost turned around and headed over to marshall 's . but like a champ , i stuck with it . its madness . after the doors open - women run towards boxes of purses and dig , dig , dig through them . then they run over to the shoes and grab every pair of tom 's they see -lrb- even though they are n't in their size -rrb- . they let their children run around and play hide n seek in the clothes racks . they do n't pick up anything either . this place quickly turned on an unkempt mess in 20 minutes . it was one of the most stressful shopping experiences i have ever had . but i did get the perfect dress , in a good brand , for $ 13 : -rrb-		2		0
hey i love me some good bj 's ! who does n't love some good bj 's ? unfortunately , this type of bj 's i did not care much for . went last night -lrb- had intended to try the auld dubliner but it was packed -rrb- you can tell someone put some serious money into this place , very modern and clean , however also very austere and cold atmosphere . they have like 6 split screens over the bar that are kind of nightmarish if you ask me . anyways , the beer was quite tasty -lrb- they have like 6 different brews and i had the red one and it was very good -rrb- but the service was how shall i say , lackluster at best . the server who actually brought our food just dropped it off and was out of there before i could even ask for ketchup and vinegar , really if you do n't ask for something right away -lrb- i quickly learned -rrb- you are kind of on your own there . our main server was pretty nonexistent t/o the experience . we both tried the fish and chips and they were ok , the fries had minimal flavor and the fish was deep fried cod which was competent but nothing special . we also had two small wedge salads which were again , ok but nothing that would stand out . i do n't know , i mean i know it is a sports bar and all but i got a feel from the overall service staff that they were somehow inconvenienced by the patrons and would rather all talk and gossip together in way only immature 20 something year olds can do . if i go back i will eat at the bar where they can not escape any requests from us . but that nightmarish 6 big screen thing is really annoying . i do n't see bj 's surviving longtime , it is too big for its own good , the service is careless , and its food above all is nothing more than average . i gave the bland waitress only $ 5 for being such robot -lrb- and that was better than she deserved -rrb- . do n't they know all they have to do is put `` some '' effort into it and they get better tips ? do n't you learn this in waiters school or something ? we all love good bjs , just not this kind !		2		0
based on yelp reviews , we dined at this restaurant recently on a double date . the building itself is adorable . maybe used to be an old house ? it 's cozy and you feel like you will be served some home cookin ' with a twist . our appetizer of spinach artichoke dip was delicious but the meal declined after the beginning . my husband and i both ordered the chile relleno . the description looked fantastic but the polenta was bland and the chile itself -lrb- for not being heavily fried -rrb- was very greasy and left me wanting . one of our friends ordered the crab cakes which he described as fine . toward the end of our meal , a gnat was discovered floating in a manhattan at our table . our server was notified , she took the drink away after asking if our friend wanted a replacement -lrb- he declined -rrb- and we waited for our check . the drink was still included on the check and the waitress seemed a bit surprised when he asked for it to be removed . i think the reason i was so disheartened about this experience was we still ended up paying about $ 70 for our meal -lrb- just for myself and my hubs . -rrb- unfortunately , coronado is not worth the food , price or overall experience .		2		0
summer doldrums perhaps ? i have been to st. francis a number of times and generally the food has been quite delightful until last night -- a friend and i went for dinner -- and enough things were n't right to write a review and wave a little warning flag . my friend ordered several sides -- among them were the fingerling potatoes and roasted vegetables -- now when i think of roasted vegetables -- i think of eggplant , squash , peppers , asparagus -- but only beans and corn ?? i do n't think so -- for the price it seemed very skimpy and not very imaginative or creative which i know the st. francis can do . she also ordered the fingerling potatoes -- which were underdone and flavorless -- this after they had been forgotten on the order and attempt made to foist a bowl of soup on my friend instead . i ordered the white fish -- which was okay but not great and was served at a temperature of somewhere between not warm and cool . the restaurant was not terribly busy -- so perhaps this was just an off night -- if you ca n't get the simple things right like roasted vegetables and potatoes -- there is something wrong in the kitchen .		2		0
i ca n't even begin to say how many poor customer service experiences i have had here . we used to do lunches a few times a week at my old job and zipps seemed to be one of the regular spots , although i always made a fuss . rather than being stuck in the office and miss out on the lunch gossip , i always opted to go , and every time , it was the same old story ... this place is never too busy during lunch , but service is slower than the second coming . it would take 1.5 - 2 hours for the small group of us to make it through lunch . not to mention that after consuming my first beverage , the glass would remain empty , my number one dining pet peeve . i do have to say that i ca n't completely hate on zipps because their food really is good . they have awesome nachos and sandwhiches . i have never been disappointed with the quality of my food . and when i was having a calorie splurge day , zipp 's pizookie was the perfect way to do it ! zipps gets a 2 star rating from me , but if they get their service act together , we can negotiate a better score ...		2		0
i have been sick and was really craving a burger and fries . i have been driving past the new five guys on 44th and today seemed like the perfect day to try . the service was actually really good and the employees were very friendly . also , just a side note they have the really cool new coke machines that allows you to mix flavor into your fountain drink as seen on food network . the problem is the food . we got 2 burgers , hot dog and fries . the fries i thought were decent but over salted . the hot dog was nothing special and the burger was a let down . i was really expecting a in-n-out style burger and walked away with a smashburger experience . all hype no follow thru . i was also shocked that a place that prides themselves on their burgers and relying on one product they do n't ask how you would like it cooked . even when ordering a burger at chile 's i am asked how i would like it done i have to say i was surprised , seeing as they are zagat rated i was expecting a lot more . the concept is fresh , clean and i like the peanuts you can munch on while you stand in line and wait for your order . just overall i think they need to improve the quality of their seasoning and style .		2		0
i have been very disappointed in avanti 's lately . i used to love it . a friend and i each got groupons to go so i thought great ca n't beat half off . i had n't eaten here in years . nothing has changed it 's dark and outdated . they need a ramsey make over for sure . the service was good although it was very difficult to understand our waiter he had an extremely thick accent . the caesar salad was very good . the veal parm which is my favorite of all time was not good . the veal was rubbery and the breading soggy . the pasta was way overcooked although the sauce was good . the tiramisu was soggy as well . the cake at the bottom was soaking wet . yuck if not for the groupon i would have sent this back . but half off an overpriced meal made me think i got what i paid for . well we had another groupon to use so we went back . the second time the service and atmosphere the same . me thinks there is a microwave doing heavy duty in the back . this time i had seafood risotto bluck ! the risotto was undercooked and had no flavor . the seafood tasted dirty and there was grit in my shrimp . this risotto was a disaster ! my friends vegetables were mush . it was worse than the first visit . the worst part of both visits is that the restaurant was almost empty on a sunday evening and the food was sub par it makes no sense to me . the long and the short of it i wont be back . avanti 's has slipped to olive garden level with macaroni grill prices ! way over priced .		2		0
great potential , badly executed . i came here for taco tuesdays ... awesome prices . $ 1 for beef , chicken , pork tacos , $ 2 for steak , mahi , and crispy fish tacos . $ 2 domestic and imported drafts , $ 3 margaritas and sauza shots . horrible service . not my first time here , but on this instance i had to wait 30 minutes to order a drink and tacos . and 15 minutes after that i had to ask my waitress where my drink was . frustrating . good margaritas tho .		2		0

j and i went for sunday morning brunch at wandering horse the other sunday . with all the 5 star reviews , we figured this place would be a hit . in the end , we were disappointed . j definitely was when he was given the total price at the register . did he have sticker shock ? that 's putting it lightly ! he stated , `` for $ 50 + for the 2 of us , this better be good ! '' the dining room is very nice and the staff is extremely friendly . after getting our drink order put in , we walked into the food room . not as much of a selection as i had expected . i 'm usually all over some chinese food , but after looking over the selection , i passed it over . for the section we overall enjoyed the most , it was hands down the mexican food . here 's a rundown of what we tried and liked/disliked : sushi - j said they were pretty good for california rolls . prime rib - very tender . lacking in flavor though . thank goodness for the horseradish sauce . peppered bacon - very fatty . j said it was more like eating a slice of fatty ham than crispy bacon . french toast w / blueberry sauce - this was a favorite of mine . green chili - this was one of our favorite dishes . paired with the fresh house made tortillas , beans , and rice . lamb chops - this was our other favorite dish . very flavorful and tender . all in all , we felt like it was n't worth the money for us to eat there .		2		0
it 's a sportsbar , so i know i ca n't be too picky , but majerle 's could add at least one or two decent microbrews -lrb- shock top does not count -rrb- and they could freaking turn down the awful music mix during halftime at 2 pm on saturday to sub-ear bleeding levels . great service , though ! that should be mentioned .		2		0
three of us went to jf on the saturday before st patties to have an early dinner . there was a sign outside stating 2 for 18 $ prime rib , potato , and soup . so they sat us at a table in the bar area . the tables are narrow and the seats did n't move so we all had to scoot forward which is n't so comfortable . the young waiter came to the table and did not welcome us or greet us , he just asked what we wanted to drink and left . so we ordered the prime rib , the funny thing is he asked how we wanted it cooked . to my knowledge , prime rib is always rare ??? then he asked what we wanted on the potato , one of us stated fully loaded in which he stated , that 's a two dollar upcharge . then , i ordered a caesar salad , which i never received ... so the young man , with blonde hair told us how tired he was since he bought a jeep last night and went out in the dunes drinking ... no excuse for poor service though . the meal was good , nothing special though . oddly enough , we never got our soup which was stated on the sign outside ... maybe the guy who got my salad got our soup ? i eat out everyday , and in peoria its very competitive for your dollar . jf is in a building that another pub failed in ... nuff said . i would email jf , but their website is under construction . click on the picture to see the sign ... never got the soup never got the salad johnnys please respond to me		2		0
just did n't feel like making dinner tonite , and wanted something quick , yummy and good for me . i noticed zoes on my drive home and decided to stop in and check it out . the food was pretty good ! i got the grilled chicken platter with a side of rice . i left feeling full -lrb- but like the good kind , not the `` on my god i 'm gon na pass out '' kind ; -rrb- and satisfied ! i gave it 2 stars because it is kinda generic and there are so many hidden gems to keep an eye out for . : -rrb- enjoy !		2		0
we ordered bbq brisket sliders and a hamburger . we waited and waited and waited i do n't know how much time passed but the waiter apologized to us and said our food would come right up . -lrb- lunch time -rrb- then we continued to wait and i think at this point another 20 minutes passed and we were told we did n't have to pay for our meals . i hate to be ungrateful but i need to mention my medium burger came out dry and well done and i had some decent fries but they were thrown over fries underneath that were also raw and not cooked . i was told they rolled out a new menu yesterday and the kitchen just stayed in a meltdown mode . i also know i should have ordered something bbq since it is a bbq place but they did n't have a bbq brisket sandwich on the menu and only had it in sliders i find sliders are too much bread for me and i am not liking sliders these days . my husband ordered the bbq brisket sliders and i took a bite and i do have to say they are absolutely delicious , not too fatty and flavored just right , with pickled onions that really make them bright and pop ! the meat to bun ratio was much better than other sliders i 've tried . i would give them another try and order something beef brisket but i would never order a burger from here .		2		0
i had to revise my review - the rose and crown has revised their menu , and , my friends , it is not good . i love me some pub trivia - my husband and i have been going for several years , and it is just fun ! the rose and crown has the potential for some quality pub trivia time , but the latest mc sucks . slow , horrifyingly bad at reading the questions , slow . slow . this would be redeemed by some decent food to keep us occupied , but alas , r & c 's food is terrible . there is one single vegetarian option on the menu : mixed greens with shredded cheese , terrible looking tomatoes , and cucumbers . the kind of salad that vegetarians make jokes about - seriously , r & c , you are mere blocks from the downtown phoenix public market , you have no excuses for the vegetable suckage . if you ask for a grilled cheese -lrb- which is not on the menu -rrb- , it comes with bacon - and is super greasy and disgusting -lrb- even when you ask them to remake you one without the bacon -rrb- . so , i am not really in a hurry to go back .		2		0
so i went back to carlys and ordered the caprese sandwhich . i was expecting to get a panini filled with mozzarella , fresh basil , pesto , and tomatoes . what i got was bread with tons of melted mozzarella , half a slice of tomatoe split between 2 slices . there was a speck of basil to be found , and no pesto anywhere . i looked to make sure . it was good if you wanted a mozarella cheese sandwhich , but it would have been excellent if it had more than a sliver of a tomatoe , and perhaps a speck more of basil and maybe even some pesto that was advertised . another reason that made this experiance kinda of blah is i ordered the sandwhich to go , as i was on my lunch break , so i could n't even have it corrected . somewhat annoying ! ohwell . perhaps another day that i feel like having a grilled mozzarella cheese sandwhich i will go back .		2		0
we came in extra early for dinner on the way to an event . the place was packed and on a wait with mostly sports enthusiast also on the way to an event . that normally is a good sign that things should be running well . i did notice the hostess using great restraint not filling every single table to pace the kitchen . eventually we got seated , my husband ordered a drink off the drink menu , i thought they might run too sweet so i ordered what i thought was a common drink that you can get anywhere a bloody mary . the waiter comes back very apologetic and tells me they do n't have the ingredients to make a bloody mary and hands me the drink menu so real fast i picked skinny mojito not realizing it was raspberry flavored because i picked it out too fast and did n't read it all . he brings it over and the color is bubblegum pink . so i tried it and there was no way anyone anywhere can drink this drink , it really was that bad the chemical taste was overwhelming . it was the worst drink i ever tasted anywhere and i was n't even able to chug it for a buzz . i do note my husbands drink was drinkable but left an after taste in my mouth and he also could n't believe how horrible the raspberry mojito was . we decided to share and start with two cheeses that come with two chunks of bread each and a tiny pot of rasp berried cherries . this was the highlight of the meal and i am not a fan of rasp berried cherries . however the cheeses and bread was fresh cut to order and that is how it should be done . when we finished my waiter did notice i pushed away the drink and asked me if i wanted to try another drink . i said no , i will just drink water and he took it away . -lrb- and off the bill -rrb- i decided to try the salmon and envisioned it tasting good with apples and farro . but what i received was less than a dieters portion as a whole , the fish had a nice sear on it but was n't as fresh as i like and was a little over cooked but edible . a very small amount of spinach and fennel garnished the fish that was approximately a tablespoon total . i could tell just by looking at the farro it was n't cooked . i was brave and decided to try the farro and it was undercooked being very chewy and also was what i am thinking might have been end of the pan because it also was hard and crunchy and i could have damaged my teeth eating it . i also was n't a fan of the flavors because this entree was as sweet as dessert . little tiny light like small water chestnut shape things were elevating the salmon and they was odd , honestly i thought they were water chestnuts but they turned out to be the apples that i forgot about . i doubt that this dish is suppose to be this was and do chalk it up to them being massively busy and running out of food . but this dish was a train wreck and i was steaming over the crunchy farro that was hard to chew . my husband had the jambalaya , he said the chicken in it was very dry and he thought all the ingredients were cooked separately and then just tossed together . we were checked on when we were finished at that point i really did n't feel like bringing up the farro after that traumatizing pink drink . my husband meant well and was sorry he picked this place for dinner .		2		0
basically , i have to be in love with a band and desperate to see them to suffer through a night at the marquee . although the location is convenient , the sound sucks , parking can sometimes be difficult , it 's nearly impossible to get a drink at their bar , and they treat their customers like criminals . they make you take your shoes off to get in the venue ! need i saw more ?		2		0
cibo is very cool and i love it . it is doomed to always be compared to pizzeria bianco , unfortunately , which is a battle cibo will never win in terms of the pizza itself . having said that , in terms of ambiance , i can honestly say that it 's either a tie or a slight edge in cibo 's favor . the wait is often more bearable than for bianco , though not always . the charming atmosphere of the historical house in which it 's set automatically lends itself to having a good time yukking it up with your pals over beers and appetizers and yummy pizza . the outdoor eating area is also something that bianco does n't even have . my bottom line : these are two great restaurants in the downtown area , both of which i appreciate for existing . update 12/28/07 : i came here again with a large group of 10 people . the service can be best described as friendly-but-incompetent . our waiter consistently forgot to bring things out we 'd requested -lrb- we just gave up on some of them -rrb- , and seemed more interested in socializing with another party of 4 he was attending to for 10 minutes at a time , rather than bothering to make sure even our most basic needs were met . i was very disappointed . on the plus side , i tried their desserts for the first time and even though i do n't have a sweet tooth , the nutella crepes blew me away . delicious . nothing like parisian crepes but you 're not in paris so who cares ? yummy . one last note : do n't bother bringing small children here , due to the wait times . my friend 's two munchkins -lrb- ages 3 and 6 -rrb- deserve a nobel peace prize in my opinion for putting up with the evening without going into hurricane mode . update 4/5/08 : what the hell is your problem , cibo ? i convinced a group of 4 people to take a 15 minute walk with me to your place , one of whom was wearing heels . when we get there ? you 're `` out of pizza '' . oh no , you 're not just out of pizza ... you 're actually `` out of food '' , except for salad . i do n't care if it was first friday . you 've now had over a year to experience first friday 's new huge crowds and plan accordingly . downgrade to 2.5 stars .		2		0
3/16 update : i 've decided to remove two stars from my rating because my recent visits have just been disappointing . the grilled pork is more baked than grilled - no smokiness or tasty charred bits anywhere . the pho tastes more of msg than boiled beef bones . and service is as bad as ever . i wonder if da vang 's popularity has led it to take shortcuts for efficiency . definitely not worth going out of your way for - go to khai hoan in tempe for the smokey grilled pork or saigon nites in scottsdale for the delicious pho instead . prior review : essential pre-eating check list for da vang 1 . turn your expectation on service down to zero 2 . voluntary separation of restaurant decor & atmosphere from the dining experience 3 . limited peripheral vision is a plus now you 're ready to enjoy one of the tastiest vietnamese place this side of san jose .		2		0
this place is much too overrated . unlimited food does n't really matter when the food is n't great . all of their different selections of meat have little to no flavor ... it just tastes like they sprinkle salt and pepper on everything . the salad bar was like any other salad bar ... nothing special . the service is great and that 's why i 'll give them two stars instead of one . i just do n't understand what the hype is all about . a family member of mine was thinking of having her wedding reception here and after sampling the food - she changed her mind . they also said the waiters would n't serve the salad in the private room ; everyone has to leave the room and serve their own salad ... including her , in her big , fluffy wedding dress . tacky .		2		0
i find westgate 's existence very perplexing . speaking strictly as an eastsider , i ca n't image ever coming all the way out to this place for any reason other than an event at the arena or stadium . and even if i were a westsider , i 'd probably avoid the place because i 'd have to check that there is n't a game or concert going on if i want to go there . the parking situation is an absolute mess if there is an event going on . somebody please build another access road or two to the loop 101 ! while i like most of the bars and restaurants in westgate , there 's nothing special about them . it 's mostly chains that you can find elsewhere in the valley . some of the shops are unique , but not unique enough to justify a ride out west . westgate is too big for the hockey crowd , but too small to support the football crowd . good luck getting into any of the bars before or after a cardinals game . if you 're one of the few who went to see the coyotes play , the place is all yours after the game is over . you 'd also expect there to be more fast food options for the people just trying to avoid high prices inside the venues , but there are only a few . i will give the designers credit , the place is beautifully set up . the fountains are nice to look at and getting around is simple . it 's just too bad it 's not in an area that 's set up for foot traffic unless there 's 60,000 people in the area for a game . and when that 's the case , i 'd rather stay away from these shops .		2		0
probably the worst spring training site in the valley . time has not treated this place well and it really begins to fail as you compare it to the competition . it is too bad considering the great location . getting to phoenix muni is pretty simple . you can take the 202 and get off at van buren or you could probably take the light rail if you did n't mind a bit of a walk . there is a ton of parking around muni and it is hard to find any that is free . it does exist , however , along the north-east side of the stadium in the dirt areas . if you park in the lots , be prepared to walk a mile over the hideous pedestrian bridge . once you get into the stadium , you are bombarded with concrete . there is literally concrete everywhere you look in this stadium . the only things not made of concrete are the field and the wooden signs that make up the outfield wall . all of this concrete , combined with the numerous metal seats , make this one of the hottest ballparks in the cactus league . access to the players is not that great either . while you can catch most of them coming in from right field , their practice field is difficult to get to and secluded . pitchers do warm up down the lines which gives you a seat just a few feet from a fastball . in all , muni is a failure . the city of phoenix must improve the area greatly for it to continue to host spring training . it would be nice to see them convert the parking lot into a multi-story entertainment development but , right now , the zoo is the only other thing over there . there are no grass seats which is really part of the fun of spring training . there is little shade . there are few reasons to go to the stadium and that is unfortunate because the a 's are such a good team to watch .		2		0
cliff note 's version : - soggy fries - paper thin patty - overpriced - free peanuts -lrb- who really cares about this ? -rrb- - average flavor - soggy fries - cool soda machine - short line because everyone already discovered this place is meh . a burger fries and drink are what , $ 10-12 ? but i can go to in n out and get superior fries , a superior burger , all while watching them smash potatoes while i wait in the drive thru all for $ 6 ?!?!?! please explain to me why this place exists again . this is what you get with massive corporate food chains . i expected nothing less . i 've tried it twice , wo n't even go back . i encourage everyone to go here though , i do n't need a longer line at places i enjoy ! ; -rrb-		2		0
we made two trips to bliss/rebar . the first time . . we sat at a table for 20 minutes , i kid you not , and no one came by . apparently the new hostess forgot to assign us a server . we left and i wrote them an email . the owner was nice enough to invite us back and offer complimentary drinks and appetizer . i figured , why not ? we get there and am pleased that our server is pleasant -lrb- probably the best experience about this place -rrb- . we ordered a ruby grapefruit martini and an orange-cicle to start with . the drinks were strong but i 'd never shell out $ 10 for something that small and plain . appetizer : chicken lettuce wraps . the lettuce wraps were covered in too much sauce and really looked like a pf changs rip-off . did n't taste too great . too runny and too salty . the boy ordered beef nachos and i had the ` loaded ' macaroni and cheese . the nachos are deep fried , but the cheese is too milky and does n't have any kick . the beef was n't cooked in any spices , tasted like they just threw it on the pan . so plain . the macaroni and cheese ? welp , i got it without bacon . . and it looked like it was out of an instant box with some store-bought powder bread crumbs on top . way too milky and runny . . tasted bland . mac and cheese needs to be rich , thick , cheesy . this did n't make the cut . i sent it back after a few bites and decided not to get anything else . experience over . we 're never coming back . although the service was better the second time around , the food is overpriced and bland . thanks , but no thanks .		2		0
joeys joeys joeys ... i brought the fam here to enjoy a nice burger and well i was disappointed . my 2/3lb burger was not the fat thick burger as i once had . it is now 2x 1/3rd patties . not even close . no flavor at all . -lrb- as an owner pointed out they have always used 2x 1/3rd patties ... maybe i was looking for the 1/2lb ? -rrb- either way it was a hand parttied and one thick patty not thin ones . the onion rings were boring , the frys were boring , the chicken nuggets were boring , the fish was good and tarter sauce was great . too much boring and too much money . i think joeys out grew themselves .		2		0
i 've been here quite a few times for after work drinks with coworkers since it 's just down the street from where i work . it 's an ok place , but with 4 peaks just on the other side of the parking lot we usually tend to pass on this place . we went yesterday and it was a disappointment . we got there before they started charging a cover -lrb- at 4 pm -rrb- otherwise it would have been $ 10 to get in . i 'm guessing that this was to pay for the limited tables , chairs and one tent they rented . also the band who was singing `` your body is a wonderland '' and something else by snow patrol . also they were charging $ 6 for drinks . it was just a little ridiculous . it was pretty much imposable to get drinks or food inside , which those of us who have tried their food before , were n't big fans of anyway . and to top it all off they closed rubio 's next door . a funny sight were these two ladies who brought a little girl who looked like she was 6 and 2 babies who did n't look old enough to walk . the moms ' had a beer in one hand and were each pushing their stroller with the other . i know times are tough , but it you can afford buying a $ 6 beer , you can afford getting a babysitter .		2		0
this was our first time here and all i can really say is , meh . we walked into the restaurant and waited 5 minutes for someone to come to the hostess stand . then we waited another few minutes for the woman to escort us back . she was nice , but there should have been someone at the hostess stand when we walked in . so let 's discuss these little booths that they have . the problem with a place that puts you in a small booth with curtains is that it gets stuffy . when the curtains open air flows in and if your server is say , a smoker , you will smell nothing but the smoke . this is what happened to my husband and i. i am very sensitive to smoke , so i think i noticed it more than him . the food was ok . the service was slow , it took us over 2 hours to have two cheese fondue courses and some chocolate . we might be back to check out the happy hour specials .		2		0
after my first visit which was great i had high expectations for breakfast . the place was very quiet as was the entire area , around 10 am . ordered coffee , nothing great . ordered an oj , which was good due to the fresh juicing . the eggs benedict $ 12 were nothing great , english muffin was hard as if stale and the hollandaise was over salted . the spinach , ham , cheese omelet $ 10 was good , but the mornay sauce was also over salted as were the breakfast potatoes which had no other flavor . the server was also just okay , most of his time was spent talking with the other staff . the server i had previously was busy with her one table and i envied them . in these tough economic times , you got ta go the extra mile or people will go to the breakfast club down the way as i discovered as i walked the quiet zone to scottsdale road .		2		0
i really used to like this place but when the management changed , so did everything else . i remember when for lunch there would be a line to the door , now i never see anyone in there . i might go here 1 or 2 times a year , nothing really that great about it anymore , right when i step in the place seems kind of dirty and is n't very welcoming . if they made some changes . . this place could be decent again .		2		0
i went there the other night for dinner . granted , i was there early but other than two people sitting talking in the restaurant , there was nobody there . i ordered a chicken arepa , shredded beef empanada , and the ground beef pastelito . the kid who took my order behind the counter said it would take 15 to 20 minutes . i could n't figure out why it would take so long-maybe they had a lot of take out orders for pizza -lrb- they share the same kitchen with rosati 's -rrb- . instead of taking 15 to 20 minutes , i 'm waiting there around 30 minutes , the kid has disappeared , and once in awhile , i see some other guys in the back . they must know i am waiting , but not once does anyone come out and tell me that my order will be out shortly . finally , some other guy who looks like he could be the boss asks me what i ordered . i tell him , and he brings out my bag , which seemed to have been sitting there for who knows how long . it seemed hot so i left and did not complain . as far as the food , never having had an arepa before , i was not too impressed . it was somewhat bland and it tasted like a taco . the empanada was incredibly greasy . the pastelito was the best-the ground beef was tasty . i might go back and try some other items on their menu but they need to improve on their customer service especially when there is virtually no one in their restaurant .		2		0
maybe if i lived in the same neighborhood , i 'd dig this dark little old house as a casual off-property meetup spot . otherwise , i 'll put all my hipster cred on the line by saying that this place is rather unimpressive . last weekend , i convinced a couple of friends who had moved away from phx in recent years that the downtown area is much improved and not a bad place to hang out on a friday night . but oh what a poor example this bar was . it 's dark and tough to see from the street , the inside is somewhat cool looking but basically uninviting , and the front gate area is crowded with smokers because there is no other place for them . this probably explains the rather meager crowd we observed there ... granted , this trip was better than a couple years ago when i would have complained that it was too crowded and seating is rather awkward . but i think that just illustrates the fact that this place is overall an unnatural bar setting . maybe it was meant to be a cafe instead , where at least the food would distract you from the dullness .		2		0
we tried to go there the other day . i said tried because we did go there around 10:30 for a late breakfast early lunch . my friend and i walked inside to be great by what is pretty much the same set up as dish had . the place seems to have everything you can think of food wise but lacks in the employee department . we walked around trying to find some menus to order from since sandwiches or pizza seemed a bit heavy . every employee stared us down like we are n't supposed to be there as we walked by but never offered assistance . after around 10 minutes of aimlessly walking around , i went over to the catering area and asked the lady if we could get breakfast . she informed met that they do not have servers but if we wanted to order a la cart breakfast items we could do so at the espresso bar . we head over to the espresso island but see nothing breakfast related on their lcd menu screen . the guy in the island ignores as he did the previous time we stood in front of his area until i finally had to ask for a breakfast menu since it was n't listed on the lcd screen . he tells me they only have a la cart burrito type items but they stop serving breakfast at 10:30 and it is now 11 am . umm ok ? at this point we just gave up and left . so we pretty much aimlessly walked around for 15 minutes to not be helped by the employees working until we had to search out workers out to help us . i 'm sure the food is wonderful , it looked wonderful but i do n't know if i want to take the time to drive and then wait for someone to help me to try it out . at least the people at dish acted like they wanted your business .		2		0
when you compare fair trade to conspire and lux ... ummm ... well ... there is no comparison ... fair trade 's decor is bland and last time i went there the barista was less than personable . also they lack the electrical outlets at every table which at this late state in the game is a fail for any coffeehouse .		2		0
after looking for this restaurant for 20 minutes and calling for directions twice we finally located this establishment basically its next to jewel of the crown indian restaurant . we met some friends there for breakfast the good part of this experience was the veggie hash i had was good all though i ordered it with two poached eggs which came hard as rocks i think all in all the food was good but it took a good 45 minutes to get it and our friend could n't seem to get a coffee refill the whole time we waited even though the other waitperson was with in steps i flagged her over but she would not go out of her section to fill the cup .		2		0
i 'm not sure why i 'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 . i think maybe a different pizza would be better ? i got this pizza i forget the name but it had red peppers and onions and parmesan . i got it minus the parmesan . it came back looking delicious . at first bite it was good , the onions were sweet and tasty ... . but then i tasted that first , there was no sauce which it did n't mention on the menu . then the after taste was over cooked butter and bad garlic . they smear butter in between the crust and the cheese . cheese and butter make an awful combo . i wish the butter and horrible garlic were n't on there . it was ruining the otherwise good pizza . i 'm mean it was so bad i could n't eat it . i got a salad too , the emilia or something . it said it had pine nuts , arugula , red onions and red peppers . balsamic vinaigrette . ok you picture it loaded with pine nuts , onions and peppers . it gets to the table and it a whole head of lettuce and like four shavings of a pepper and a thimble of pine nuts . i maybe saw 2 things of onion . i had the waitress bring the balsamic on the side and the lemon vinaigrette on the side . the dressings could have been good if they did n't use whatever oil it was . i 'm like 90 % sure it was soybean oil . it was a very strong flavor that was overpowering and bad , real bad . i took like 2 bites . it was a really bad meal . i can see the potential , and i will try a pizza with a sauce this next time .		2		0
all i can say is `` i 've had better . '' i 've had better brucetta . the bread was soggy from the toppings . ingredients did n't taste fresh . i 've had a better salad . we split the veggie salad that tasted bland and i could n't even taste the jicama and beans . the avocado saved the salad . i 've had better service , but it was n't the waitress ' fault . the manager should have hired more staff as this poor waitress was serving at least 20-30 people out on the patio . it took us over an 1.5 hours to get our 4 piece brucetta and salad . the only reason i am giving 2 stars is due to the great selection of wine . sorry 5th and wine but i 'm sticking with postinos .		2		0
approaching zb for a sunny february lunch i was struck by the crowd at the tables outside seemingly trying their upmost to convince themselves they were in st tropez and not the keirland commons shopping mall . it was such a motley crue of burberry wearing benz drivers that it was quite an effort not to burst out laughing . needless to say i asked for a table inside ! greeted by a surly host we were shown to a table for two which in classic bistro style was on the small side but it was n't a busy thursday so we had plenty of space . zb has done a good job with the recreation of french bistro decor but you had the feeling it was more american french than french french . as if they had been to bourdain 's les halles in new york and tried their best to recreate the look and feel of his authentic bistro . i ordered moules marieniere with stringier then usual shoestring fries -lrb- frankly they were so thin they were worthless -rrb- . the mussels were tasty and the buttery white wine sauce has a nice kick to it and stood up well to bread dipping at the end of the meal . the mussels themselves were a little rubbery but if you order seafood in the desert i always think you have to be forgiving . my fellow diner ordered a burger and the small taste i had was a delight , one of the best tasting burgers in some time and a nice lunch size , not huge so you would n't be weighed down for the rest of the day . this was my second visit to zb . last time i ordered a really unimpressive duck confit sandwich and so i was hoping it would be a better experience all round this time , sadly not ... should a burger be the thing that impresses you most at a french bistro ? this joint is a classic example of having the look but not delivering the product . french bistro food should be fresh and simple but my second time here delivered just an ` ok ' dining experience . small things like the waitress pronouncing the 's ' on moules and the wine menu offering george duboeuf ` morgan ' when the wine is actually a ` morgon ' . if you are going to attempt french authenticity you should make sure the details are correct . the final reason i wo n't be back was when i turned round and saw the same surly hostess taking her shoe off and rubbing her foot before putting it back on and handling menus . non merci .		2		0
this place is a dump . if you need to get rid of some books , just donate them to goodwill or a veterans group , because you 'll get more self satisfaction . i dropped off about 40 books today and they would only offer me $ 3 . $ 3 ? are you effing serious ? nope , no thank you . i 'll drop them off at the va. . if you 're looking for older fictional books or records , this place has a pretty serious selection ; however , if you 're looking for something more present and/or relevant , look somewhere else . hell , if you 're looking for a 1990 's version study guide for the sat , then this is your place ! this place is so outdated , you can see the dust when you walk in ...		2		0
i have always enjoyed dinner with friends at phoenix city grille . i had never tried happy hour there so a friend and i decided to give it a try . we sat for almost 10 minute at bar before we were asked if we 'd like a drink . the green chile queso fundido was quite tasty . we intended to order a few other items but we had to pry the bartenders to return for refills and food that we decided to leave and continue happy hour elsewhere . keep you posted on our return to pcg ...		2		0
when i say i 've experienced better , it 's because i 'm thinking of yogurtland and how their yogurt is 2x as good and half the price . which for you mathphobes means an overall fourfold increase in happiness quotient . the yogurt is decent but the selection lacked things that i wanted . but being so expensive , i expected more . the yogurt at golden spoon is much better too . so i 'd say go to one of these other places .		2		0
i have to start by saying this review is of my visit on this particular occasion not over it 's history . this is one of my favorite places to eat in arizona and i recommend it to everybody i know . i even brought my grandparents about a week back for a great meal . however my meal on valentines day was sub-par especially for this restaurant . as i said this is one of my favorite places and my girlfriends favorite as well as the site of one of our first dates so we figured it was the perfect spot for valentines day . we were wrong . the issues started out early on when i called for reservations and asked for what was available -lrb- this was 11am the day of as we had originally planned to be out of town -rrb- and was told 8:45 pm was the earliest . i took the reservation . my girlfriend decided to check open table and found a bunch of tables available before then . we got one scheduled for 7:15 and i canceled mine . we arrived and it was not busy at all . nobody standing in the lobby like normal and no wait . a couple even walked in ahead of us and was seated immediately without even being asked if they had a reservation . we were seated promptly as well . once seat things went ok the usual chopped liver and bread came out which was good as always . then we ordered our meals along with the shrimp de jogon that my girlfriend likes and wanted me to try . it took forever to come out and we only got it once our waitress looked over and saw it was not there and said let me check . she came back with it and warned that it was very hot . which it was but sadly i think that meant it had been under the heat lamps for too long as the shrimp had become way over cooked and chewy . it was to the point the tails were hard to remove and my girlfriend even commented that there was very little sauce and what was there had dried around the shrimp . it was a $ 10 app that i wish i never ordered . next came our steaks . we both had the filet mine was the bigger of the two both cooked medium-rare -lrb- or at least ordered as such -rrb- . hers came out more to the rare side but not horribly and mine came out way too medium with hardly any pink in the center . the outside of mine was more charred than they normally do and the taste of the char over powered what is normally a well flavored steak . at this point we had decided to skip desert and call it a night as we had been disappointed enough . having had a wonderful meal here less than 2 weeks before this one i really hope this was a fluke but it was a very disappointing night . i am hoping a return visit in the future will make me feel better about what is normally a 4.5 star place in my book .		2		0
now , i do n't use any of the gear in this store really . but it 's a place to pass a little time out from the heat . it has everything you would need for camping , boating , etc. . i take my little one and we walk around looking at all the stuffed animals in there ` life-like ' settings . and there 's a great big aquarium tunnel of fresh water fish to see . the kids like that . then we 'll maybe look at some of the clothes and maybe have lunch . they have a cafe upstairs . they have many things , some basic like hamburgers , hot dogs , salads . but also some rare like elk , rabbit , etc. . but do n't expect high marks on the food . it 's more of a cafeteria feel than a ` cafe ' . all in all , it 's just a place to waste a bit of time unless you are an avid outdoorsman .		2		0
i got to say this is probably the most accurate 3 star overall rating i 've seen on yelp in some time . i 'm proud of you phoenicians ! this place was simply meh , especially given the huge amount of delicious mexican food places in az where you can get a kick ass margarita for a whole lot less than $ 10 . we ordered a couple drinks and were disappointed with all of them ; consensus was that they were all too sweet and not enough tequila , the sangria tasted like juice for peets sake . the chips are a nice thicker version however the salsa is thin and flavorless . roast those tomatoes or something , throw in some heat ! their guacamole , although a decent flavor profile , needed a lot more lime and was super blended to the texture of those nasty avocado ` dips ' you find next to french onion and ranch plastic containers . we all ordered tacos of various types for dinner , i had the roasted veggie ones with a hard shell . man these were no good . the veggies were really oily from their saute and were used sparingly ; the bottom of the tacos was cabbage . honestly , the only good thing i ate tonight was the black beans , abet a bit salty . i will say our server was very friendly however the food just do n't hold water to the prices . try tia rosas in mesa for some excellent mexican food and margaritas worth their $ 8 and more in tequila .		2		0
after taking the girls shopping at the mall we decided to try kona grill . the menu had a wide selection of food to satisfy everyones taste . we ordered the basil pesto linguine , the chefs salad and various sushi . the wait time on the food was a little long for the amount of business they had . the flavor of the dishes were average with nothing standing out . typical mall restaurant , average food for above average prices . i dont know why i was expecting anything different .		2		0
its okay ... foods good . . had the strawberry salad service is good ... just really do n't care for the clientele . snooty scottsdale women who `` lunch '' . perhaps i was n't in the mood , i do n't know . just did nothing for me . would n't go back .		2		0
what a disappointment ! after reading these reviews and even hearing good -lrb- not great -rrb- reviews for a couple family members , we headed her this sunday . first off , i thought the service was mediocre to poor . not friendly , no smiles , and they never came back to the table except to take the order and deliver the food . no water , no extra chips for the table of four , nothing . my wife tried the huevos rancheros , which were okay , not terrific . congealed eggs versus over easy , but a big tortilla . $ 6-7 bucks , so did n't break the bank . i had the two enchiladas and shredded taco plate , about $ 10 . overpriced , greasy , and just not very good . gut bomb was more like it . my daughter had two shredded beef tacos for $ 4 , filling . my son had a $ 4 or so bean an cheese burrito , again just okay . re-fried beans were paste , and more lard than beans it tasted like . rice was good , not great . anyway , not even in the top 1/2 of mexican restaurants i 've been to . definitely not in the top 3-4 like many reviews seem to indicate . i live downtown , so only about 5 min from here . i really wanted this to become my favorite new place . but when a place is in a just okay neighborhood , dirt driveway , and mediocre to poor interior , man , their food and service needs to shine . and they just do n't . i wo n't be back . by the way , if anyone wants to know my favorite mexican owned and operated , not ritzy but excellent food place in phoenix , head to las glorias south of northern on 19th avenue . better value , better food , better decor , and way better service .		2		0
the only good thing about this place is the guy working there was really nice : -rrb- oh and you can drive through . the bad . they dont even have coffee !!!!!! wtf !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its 2 shots esspresso and milk , wtf . it tasted very very burnt and had no flavor other than burnt . sadly starbucks might even be better : -lrb-		2		0
i love mexican food !!! one of the first things i always try when i go to a new place is the chiles rellenos . its a great benchmark for the overall quality , `` tastyness '' , and value of most everything on the menu . is the chili fresh and prepared well ? -lrb- hatch or not hatch -rrb- . is the chili stuffed with a delectable mexican cheese mix -lrb- or just jack cheese -rrb- ? what kind of batter ? egg ? breading ? -lrb- one place i went had a deep fried , crumpled saltine cracker crust that was surprisingly good -rrb- . are sides included ? habanero 's chiles rellenos was n't all that great . far to many seeds left in the chili for my taste . just melted jack on the inside . mostly egg battered outside -lrb- not very thick -rrb- . i do n't think the chili was roasted in any special way or given any other kind of seasoning ... overall it was meh . the chili came with a side of beans that were authentic yet a little boring . also included : a little spanish rice -lrb- also boring -rrb- . pico was yucky . they are very generous with the sour cream . -lrb- i noticed that sour cream and guacamole are included in most dishes so you do n't have to pay extra -rrb- . cool .		2		0
i 've been to harlow 's a couple of times now for morning meetings at breakfast . let 's just say i would not come here if i did n't have to be . it is a hole in the wall kind of place . my boss has come here since he was a child so he sentimental to it . not my kind of place , but i do know that the huevos rancheros are good .		2		0
this was stop 2 for my friends and i 's awesome pre st patty 's day drinking times . there was no line outside at about 10:15 ish . we got fireball shots for 3 $ which is a good deal imo , but other than that it was not so good . the slushies were a little on the gross side , too sweet . i got the strawberry marg and it was just too syrupy and too expensive for what you get -lrb- like 8 $ for a ` large ' which is not that large -rrb- . the music was fine and the dancing was fun , but i would n't say this is one of my favorite bars .		2		0
i have been twice now . the thing that assaults me as soon as i walk in the door is the smell of baby poop . i have no idea what causes the smell but it is very strong . my children noticed and mentioned it to me the moment they walked through the doors also . the sat at the table with their noses plugged . my kids liked the deep fried tofu for $ 3.50 and it was a good portion size . 8 large chunks of tofu . i tried the braised noodle with sesame paste -lrb- vegetarian -rrb- for $ 4 . it was so plain with very little taste . tasted slightly like peanut sauce . i had to cover it in srarachi to get it down because i was so hungry . kids liked the beef with fried noodles for $ 7.95 . with the tofu it was enough food for my 3 kids that i brought home leftovers of both the noodles and tofu . i tried the vegetables with fried noodles on my first trip for $ 7.25 . they were just okay . even though the noodles are being made right there and you can watch through the window the taste was very similar to panda express to me . had three of the smoothies - watermelon , papaya and strawberrry - all with boba . the boba was pretty good but the smoothies were n't great . i prefer boba house around the corner in the same shopping center . i do n't think i will be back .		2		0
i have been a regular at the tempe improv for years . years and years . we go probably 5-6 times a year easy . i was so sad when they closed their doors . the first time we went since they reopened was a 4 star experience bordering on 5 . i was very happy and so glad to have my tempe improv back . so off we went 3 weeks later with the whole family to see another show . now when you plan a night out , and you have to arrange babysitters etc. . you want a night out ! my niece got the babysitter , we made a reservation way in advance and we arrive at the door . but it is closed . we call wondering what we did wrong and they tell us that they are closed because of storm damage . it happens . this would be completly understandable and they would still have 4 stars . however , no one notified us . any of us and we all get emails and text updates from them regularly . how hard would it have been to send a blanket email saying we apologize for the inconvienence but we have to cancel this weekends shows due to storm damage . not only did we arrive to find this out , but the people on the phone were like oops . not i am so sorry , we will have someone contact you to remedy this , nope . nothing . zero . zilch . oops is not an acceptable answer . this is not an acceptable level of service and so very dissappointing from a local treasure . customer service is not that hard . a text , email , anything and i would not be writting this review . i would be writting a much different account . i am actually really sad . oh well . time to try one of the other local comedy clubs we now have . got ta love competition , they now have my buisness . they have contacted me this week to try to remedy this . i will be giving them another try and will write a review update when i go back .		2		0
was there last night . pho was a 2.5 on a scale of 5 . i had the one that costs a little extra with meatballs , tripe , brisket . generous amount of meat , but you know what they say , pho is all about the broth . that 's what makes it . every pho is made from beef broth even the chicken pho . and that would n't be bad if the broth was flavorful . da vang 's broth is a 5 out of 5 but i decided to compare . i had the spicy , salty shrimp with shells on . they were ok but i did n't realize i would be eating the shrimp 's caca in the process . my guest had beef with snow peas . it was spiced to his liking but the flavor just was n't there . their prices are incredibly low and that 's why i gave them an extra star otherwise it would be a one . you get what you pay for . back to da vang for me !!!!!		2		0
we went here late one night for dinner because it was the only mexican place open past 10pm . the bar was the only place available to sit down so we ordered drinks and got chips and salsa . i ordered the albondigas soup and a bean burro . the soup was extremely salty , too salty to the point where i told our waiter i was n't able to eat it . the burro was ok , i only ordered it because it was on the a la carte menu and cheap . i will say the service was pretty fast and attentive but it still is n't saving it for me to return anytime soon .		2		0
carne asada fries were disappointing .		2		0
my review is already biased from the start . i 've tried cajun cuisine about 3 times now and i 'm not a huge fan . i do n't mind eating food with seasoning and some pepper . but i do n't like eating fire sauce in any of my food . lol . well , i ordered the lunch special which was some type of chowder with jambalaya on the side . the jambalaya was way too hot for my taste buds . i was on fire . and the chowder was just okay . the service was good but the food experience was just okay . i really ca n't give the food a bad review because cajun is just not my cup of tea .		2		0
ok , yes , the beer list is incredible . it 's an amazing way to try new stuff and find new favorites to add to your drunky ass repertoire . the much-discussed orange blossom beer is pretty good , but not so good i would make a trip out of the way to get it . the food is standard bar food . well , despite the fabu beer list , this is just a bar when it comes down to it . vegetarians , take warning - eat elsewhere , unless a overstuffed , not-entirely-melted cheese quesadilla is your idea of a kick ass meal . to be fair , my so loved his brat and gobbled that sausage down like a pro . -lrb- i 've always wanted to say that . -rrb- our server was helpful and attentive . the ambiance is somewhat non-existent and , as someone else mentioned , the seating layout is fragmented . my biggest beef is with the other customers ! i 've been to many a shithole bar and never have my eardrums been so bruised and battered , my throat raw from having to scream conversation over the relentless mating calls of the idiot woo girls at the dart boards . i mean , people were staring . the manager had to ask them to stfu multiple times . and this was before 9 p.m. and they were not 18 with fake ids ; these ladies may have been older than me -lrb- gasp ! shudder ! -rrb- . if i wanted to listen to piercing screams while consuming a shitty quesadilla , i would have gone to a filiberto 's in maryvale . ugh . my so will have to get his papago fix on his own .		2		0
the problem is that the atmosphere is subpar , and the drinks are literally half full . do n't believe me order a 50/50 vesper , it 's 50 % full . i will not return .		2		0
i 'm not really a big fan of getting food that has ingredients that are n't mentioned on the menu . not just my meal but my friends had food that was n't exactly what we ordered .		2		0
the people are very friendly and nice . the food . 2 stars . meh . my sandwich roll did not feel cooked all the way through . doughy . tasted doughy as well . the meat , cheese , sandwhich itself was good . my only complaint with the toppings was the onions were in chunks and not slices . based off the menu , they had a good variety of sandwhich offerings and toppings . the 11 '' roast beef was almost $ 9 dollars with not extras on it . not worth the cost . scrunching my nose ... i do n't think i 'll be back .		2		0
it was like some strange vortex enveloped the table and took us to another dimension . . from the second the waiter man handled my hot dog . . uhm , err . . let me start from the beginning ... we decided to wait a while before trying a the new corporate chain at scottsdale fashion . . you know how the weeks following opening day can be be well , iffy . so with that in mind and have tried the burgers at the vegas location , knew that this might be fun . insane huge menu , large portions and affordable prices . upon arrival -lrb- parking is really bad since they tore down the east structure -rrb- we were greeted by a very friendly foh person and were seated immediately . the space is cavernous and was actually quite empty for a thursday night . after looking over the book of a menu decided on the kobe beef hot dogs as an app . . blue cheese salad . . the max burger . . and short rib sloppy joe . this sounds like a sort of high end weinershnitzel or something ? the server had 3 tables and she seemed a bit flustered when she finally approached us . she was a pretty neat person and was very friendly but after placing our order things started to go wrong . after about 20 minutes our kobe beef hot dog app showed up . . seriously , come on , the place was empty ! well the dogs are stacked high on thick buttered texas toast . . well when the waiter set them down he lost control and one of the dogs fell off the plate and onto my bread plate . . well , no biggie right ? wrong , he reaches over and grabs my hot dog with his bare hand while mentioning ` jesus ' as he was doing it . you 'd think i would have at least gotten a kiss first ? he puts the hot dog back on the serving plate and walks off mentioning he would get us another one . after about 10 minutes the manager comes over -lrb- very friendly -rrb- and gives us his apologies about the hot dog man handling . fortunately he had a replacement with him and took the app off the bill . let me tell you though , if you can order only one thing of the menu , these are it ! seriously . blue cheese salad showed up as a chopped salad * sigh * , drinks sat empty , bread bowl empty , manhandled jesus hot dog still in my head . the entrees finally showed up , this is a good hour after being sat in a mostly empty space . just kept humming ` things can only get better ' -lrb- still love howard jones -rrb- , ah happy place ! the the max burger was room temperature and the cheese was just sitting on top in that sort of i 'm trying to melt stage . . not good . at that point i was so over it ! now the short rib sloppy joe was pretty darn good ! piping hot and full of that familiar ` manwich ' flavor , reminded me of being in grade school again , those were the days . hmm , now i remember why i was always the fat kid in school . . ordered desserts . . new orleans beignets . . deep dark fudge cake . . and banana cream pie . . after some time the desserts finally showed up . . the beignets were huge . . ive never seen a beignet that large before . . comes with 3 dipping sauces . . while big they were just alright in taste . . i prefer the smaller ones as they are n't as doughy . . deep dark fudge cake , oh yeah ! this was almost as good as the chocolate cake at coronado cafe . . dense , chewy intense choco - curl-your-toes yumminess ! the banana cream pie , well , just order the deep dark fudge cake . . not so much on that one . . thick hard graham pie shell covered with pastry cream , brown bananas and so much whipped cream you would think they were trying to hide something , hmm , brown bananas anyone ? i still think it was some sort of vortex that we got sucked into . the nice manager came over and i joked around with him about my theory . apparently he thought it was so funny he offered to take care of the desserts and invited us to ` please give us another chance ' . he did mention that if they try to seat us at that table again , ask to be moved . im not sure if i will come back to grand lux unless i bring a spiritual guide and a set of tongs for the manhandling hot dog waiter .		2		0
my first time here several weeks ago was great . my second time lost a lot of points . monsoon rains were coming and water leaked from the ceiling onto our chairs and table . apparently the waiters did n't think a leaking roof was a big deal in a restaurant and did n't do anything to accommodate . we ended up just sliding the table away ourselves and heard no apology from anyone . we asked our server for a minute to take our order soon after we arrived . he took forever afterward and only came when we flagged him down after making awkward forced eye contact . during my meal , he took my plate without asking if i was finished - i was still working on those fries and had to physically grab his arm to set the plate back down . then there was this witch with a b giving us attitude because a friend asked why she did n't tell him she had moved his phone that was charging near the waiters ' computer workstation . they exchanged some heavy words and we asked to speak to the manager . the other workers were watching and smirking during this time . she claimed she did n't work there so she could n't get fired -lrb- she was wearing all black like every other employee and had been chatting it up with two other waiters at the station for a while , but whatever she says ... -rrb- . so minus stars because these waiters were awful and do n't care about repeat customers . minus stars for upcharging to sub for a measly portion of fries . minus stars for not stepping in to stop a confrontation in the middle of the restaurant that was completely unnecessary . minus stars for leaky roof and , hoping no one 's contaminated . they 'll get to keep a few stars because the food itself is n't that bad . there 's too many comparable restaurants in phoenix for me to be back . bye bye fez , too bad .		2		0
so i have been here three other times since my last review . i 've always had good experiences ; good service and good food . this time was a bit different however . we showed up at 10:36 am -lrb- i 'm actually still here -rrb- . there was one person in line in front of us . we placed our order a minute later . my dad ordered the breakfast buffet and was promptly told they stop service at 10:30 . there was still plenty of food all still on display in the buffet line . he told the cashier he just wanted a couple pieces of sausage and some egg and would not be going up for seconds . she again told him no , they have stopped serving for nearly 10 min . again , everything was still out and ready . so he got a yogurt parfait and iced tea . the yogurt parfait was pretty damn good . probably best i have ever had . i ordered the cafe chau chau which was good -lrb- but should n't take 13 minutes to make right ? -rrb- so about another 7-10 minutes , right out on the floor , one of the employees is throwing away all the left over food from the breakfast buffet . yes throwing it away . and there was quite a bit food left over still . it did n't make sense that they would rather throw it all away rather than make a few extra bucks and serve one last person .		2		0
my fav mall ???? no , but it has two stores that i do adore and when im in a rush this place is the one to stop by since you can get in and out relatively quick . it a mall , but not the greatest but nonetheless still a mall .		2		0

this place is n't all that it 's hyped up to be . lots of people say `` this is the best place for chinese '' it really is n't people . i 've had better from , i 'm embarrassed to admit - pei wei . i had the beef pad thai which was watery and bland . it seemed like they just added a load of hot-spices to cover up the watery substance . it was just awful ! the server took a long time to refill my water while my mouth was on fire , i 'm never going back to this place again . this place is too small to bring in a 10 person group , so do n't . sorry fate i know you mean well to the asian cuisine community , but you 're not worth my presence .		2		0
there is a reason why when i lived in scottsdale for 3 1/2 years i never ate at kyoto . but upon my last visit i decided i should try a new place . hmmmm ... i now have also learned to always trust my trusty yelper 's reviews . this was a bad choice on my part . bad , slow service . poor sushi selection . no wine menu . the sushi came out cut as thick as a piece of steak . i hate thickly cut sushi . rolls ... bland . ambiance was that of a cheap , generic restaurant . the good ... cheap , sushi was fresh and did n't taste bad . but with all that being said i 'll pass on a next time here .		2		0
i have been here twice and i 'm not sure if the fake scottsdale people annoy me more or less than the fake staff . i ordered halibut which i stressed to the waiter i hate it overdone . and indeed it was overdone . the drinks are light pours and overpriced but someone has to pay for the awesome door and decor .		2		0
eh ... it 's ok . i think i was looking for something a little more chill divey and not so sports divey . it was a little brighter inside than i expected and as i said it seemed more like a trashy sports bar than a trashy divey joint which was a pretty immediate turnoff . the pour was okay , i 've had better elsewhere for the same price . there was a slightly noticeable odor of ass in the air and it was freeeeeezing at the bar . hello people , the temperature is dropping , it 's no longer 115 degrees outside , do ya think you can raise the thermostat above 70 ??? thanks . not horrible but i doubt i 'll be back .		2		0
it was ok . too much of a chain feel to it for it to be considered authentic greek food . try pita jungle instead .		2		0
monkey pants is a bar that does n't take itself seriously -- as if its name did n't give that away . the bar hosts live music from local bands , goldfish racing and a 1 a.m. topless shot -lrb- free shots for anyone who ditches their shirts ! -rrb- deal . sadly for the guys , not a lot of women are eager to part with their clothes and the guys are usually the ones who end up topless by night 's end . this wacky spot is fun for a couple drinks , but i could n't imagine spending an entire evening here . it 's usually pretty quiet and uneventful .		2		0
the food is actually three star or maybe a bit better , and the ambience is okay . the problems : 1 . very expensive for what you get . 2 . a wait staff that hounds you to death . i 've been to a number of brazilian steak houses , where they bring skewers of meats to your table and you ask for pieces of the ones you want . you can eat until you are stuffed . there is also a salad bar which has about 30 items , most of them high end and of good quality -lrb- such as fresh mozzarella , roasted peppers , heart of palm , etc. -rrb- . they bring bread , fried bananas , mashed potatoes , and fried polenta to your table . but mostly its about the meat . fogo de chao has about ten varieties , including filet mignon , top and bottom sirloin , a couple of lamb cuts , bacon wrapped chicken , etc. . if you do n't like your meat medium rare , you will have to ask them to cook you something -lrb- which they will do -rrb- . in general , the meats are ok , but pretty much without sauce and seasoned with salt and pepper . in short , not great . the experience might still rate 4 stars , disregarding the price , if it were n't for the servers . fogo de chao gives you a disk , red on one side and green on the other . when you want the meat servers to stop by your table , you turn yours to the green side . if you are not constantly eating , within about 33 seconds , a waiter will pop over and ask if you he can get you something that they have n't brought out in the last two minutes . this is very nice -- well , it 's nice the first six times , but then it gets obvious that they are rushing you . if you sit around to digest your food , you might eat more . heaven forbid ! in any case , $ 50 just for the buffet and meat is stiff , and the food needs to be really good to warrant it . it just is n't .		2		0
sky bar , violet candies , and naughty soda drinks . let us review : sky bar , a delicious treat from the necco factory -lrb- the place that makes the chalky valentine hearts that say stuff like `` fax me '' and `` text me ur heart '' -rrb- . it is a masterpiece -lrb- even dan kennedy of candy freak fame has stated so -rrb- of candy delight for the indecisive . caramel , vanilla , chocolate , and peanut butter filling each get one single solitary chocolate pyramid all joined together in a melty seatbelt of ooey gooey self contained bliss . you can nibble one at a time , or shove the whole thing in your mouth for a psychedelic mouthgasm . at a grand $ 2.50 -lrb- i am used to like 75cents , but being across the country in a desert of 112degrees can up that price -rrb- , it is a bargain . http://www.necco.com/ourbrands/default.asp?brandid=11 violet candies : the most appealing candy wrapper , i imagine myself in some kind of victorian dress w/a parasol all anne of green gables and shit , offering the candy to my beau while he paddles our boat in a dapper vest . it tastes like springtime , like potpourri , like mysterious goth girls in the east village in the late 70s , like alice in wonderland , it is glorious and perfumey . and in an appealing square shape with a texture resembling tic tacs , candy hearts , candy necklaces and certs . it is like a grand of $ 1.50 i believe . http://victoryseeds.com/candystore/chowards_violet.html naughty sodas . i am not much of a soda drinker-i quit all the caramel coloured sodas in 3rd grade cold turkey and never looked back . but i do have an extremely soft spot for root beer , orange , grape and other novelty flavours . especially stewart 's brand . back on the east coast , we had lil drive throughs that serve black cows , which is a root beer float . but stewart 's root beer is a masterpiece . virgils is creamy and spicey , hansens has a real licorice taste , dr. browns is anise tasty , but only stewart 's gets my vote every time . they had that one , cream soda , orange n cream , lime rickey , jones soda , virgil 's , and way too many other brands/flavors to count . truly a refreshing way to cool down while perusing the strip . http://www.drinkstewarts.com/ everything else . well . there are some cool cupcake wrappers . and we were endlessly amused by the huge bouncy balls , but not $ 15 amused . the prices werent terrible , a lot of the same merch is at urban for twice/three times as much . the wall w/photo booth is cute . i just do n't get what they are going for . i was excited for this place , but i do n't think it will be its own destination for myself personally . and i agree w/everyone - more candy ! or cupcakes . or food . dang , there ai n't no food in that corner and a lady gets hungry doin ' all that browsing . and dairy queen does n't quite get it . maybe if they put in a pretzel machine or a soft serve or just had some other unique hand dipped candys ? could it be i am not much of a novelty girl ? hmmm ... violet flavoured soda filling in a sky bar ...		2		0
the only reason i went is because my dad wanted a taco . the last few times i have eaten here it has been nothing but a greasy mess . i miss the days when julio g 's was down the street . the quality control and level of care to the food has gone way down hill in the last few years , and it is really sad to see . with it being right next to the w , you 'd think they would strive to be the best place ever . if i was staying there , i 'd walk to downtown and find something else .		2		0
the service was good but i was very disappointed in the food ! very salty and fatty food : -lrb- will not be back		2		0
generally i 'm not a huge fan of macy 's just because i 'm enamored of the brand itself , which is why i feel like so many people love macy 's . yes , you have to give them props for longevity , the parade in nyc , miracle on 34th st. ... etc. ... but companies simply can not rest on their laurels and assume that bad service is ever ok . which leads me to why i 'm reviewing this location and giving 2 stars . when me mums was out for thanksgiving a few weeks ago we went there because she wanted to look at some things for xmas gifts . i drove her there and went along for the ride . while we were in the jewelry section she commented on a few items she liked and i made mental notes to come back and stock up for xmas for her -lrb- after she 'd left town -rrb- . when i went back i was astounded by the rudeness of the employees/disinterest in actually helping customers . after several searching for a sales associate in the jewelry area for about 5 minutes with no one in sight , finally a middle aged white lady appeared in the fine jewelry section . she sort of hid behind a display and when i finally made eye contact with her she seemed completely put off by the fact that i had a question about jewelry . i told & showed her what i was looking for , but in a different size and when she asked if i was looking for gold and i explained no , silver ... she rolled her eyes and wafted me away with her hand back towards the `` cheap '' jewelry . fortunately for me -lrb- and macy 's -rrb- a lovely lady named shell appeared and rushed over to help me , -lrb- despite the fact that i was `` only '' looking at $ 100 necklaces in silver -rrb- . she was super helpful , friendly and knowledgeable about her inventory , made some recommendations and showed me several pieces . i ended up getting the $ 100 necklace and a pair of earrings from her and she was more than happy to help me , ring me up with me a smile and at least redeem macy 's momentarily . shell rocks and should be promoted . the other lady should get the stick outta her choochoo and stop pretending she works at tiffany 's . on the way out i passed mens fragrance and inquired about some product for my roomie . the snotty little fashionista twink sales associate scoffed at my inquiry and and rolled his eyes and i thought i better get outta macy 's before my shell-induced glow waned any further . all said , i got what i came for and have arranged some nice xmas gifts for mom , but my overall experiences at macy 's mainly serve to solidify why i abhor the mall , large retail chains and would prefer to shop local indie .		2		0
- the waitress was friendly , bland , and close to useless - the food was bland and way beyond expensive - the restaurant is in a great location -lrb- close to the freeway -rrb- - the bill was stunning for what the 6 people in our party received . - the place was empty , except for one other table -lrb- with a couple -rrb- i 'm not sure how this place has stayed open for several years , since they have so little traffic . i 'm thinking that it 's a mafia money-laundering front , and i would recommend that my friends/family stay away . bottom line : do n't bother		2		0
a large amc theater with somewhat reasonable prices -lrb- compared to harkins and ultrastar -rrb- . the snack bar however is a different insult entirely ... `` movie nachos '' = $ 7 + . wow ! are they proud of those nasty stale nachos or what ? and for that $ 7 + purchase you only get one thing of fake cheese ? cmon amc ! this should be considered a criminal enterprise charging that much money for nasty nachos . anyways , this location does not lack parking or places to eat before or after the movie . just be wary of the criminal and insulting prices at the snack bar . really uncool prices in fact . enough to make me bring in my own `` movie nachos '' at a fraction of the price .		2		0
well i would n't really call this place a `` cocktail lounge '' like sayyyy side bar but to me it was more like a very well lit pool hall . even though there was no smoking inside it was hekka smokey in this place . i am guessing this place is 21 + thats why people like it oh and cheap drinks !?!?! i 'm not sure but this place kind of reminds me of river city pockets with less pool tables ?? if this was like the only option available i 'd go if you made me , cuz you cant fool me twice . i 'd rather just sit home and drink myself to sleep .		2		0
i used to frequent this place years and years ago when it was le petite café so decided that i might as well try this new place . it 's completely gutted from when it was the other restaurant and has a very open but hipster feel to it . the menu is on boards as soon as you walk in and you go further up to place your order with the waitress . number in hand , you sit anywhere and someone delivers the food when you 're ready . i 've been to places like that before but it 's still a weird concept for a `` sit down '' place . i got the sunrise sandwich which is basically runny eggs and ham with cheese on toast and a side of pan-fried rosemary seasoned potatoes . the sandwich was really good with plenty of ham and a lot of flavour but , and i say this as a potato lover , the potatoes were not edible . they were rubbery and flavourless like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all morning . this would n't bother me from a place like denny 's but if i 'm going to be paying nearly $ 8 for something i can make at home at a fraction of the cost , i expect high quality and flavour . also tried the italian coffee and cinnamon roll . the cinnamon roll was very fluffy and had a good helping of frosting on it . i liked that they did n't melt the frosting over it . the coffee was very good but a little costly at over $ 2 for self-serve no-frills coffee . even starbucks is cheaper than that . overall , much left to be desired . decent food but i 've had more satisfying experiences at ihop at much better prices . i can only assume all the high ratings are from people who are n't super into breakfast like me . it 's my favourite meal so i know when it 's lacking . i 'll continue mourning the loss of the little cute france-themed breakfast joint that was .		2		0
i had high hopes for the marquee . i had n't had the chance to see a band there yet , tickets for my morning jacket were $ 30 , not worth it for me . but , when a friend wanted to celebrate is birthday there , i agreed to go . first , the parking lot has no signs to signal you in , it is hard to see because it looks like you are forced to go onto the mill bridge but then make a right at the last second . parking is $ 5 ? what ? i should have parked across the street . now the tickets are not just the price you are quoted , they are marked up by a $ 3 service charge at the box office . at the box office right in the theatre ! no ticketmaster , nothing . just raise the price of the ticket ! now , they make you take everything out of your pockets and force you to be patted down . errr . then , if you want to drink they take a photo of your license for their computer . errr . was there a shooting here or something , because this is ridiculous . the interior looks like it is meant for 4 h fairs or amateur wrestling . there is a concrete floor , poor paint , and nowhere to sit . the drinks are way over priced -lrb- $ 7 a shot for jager !!! robbery ! -rrb- . give me $ 100k and i will turn this place into a venue worthy of its location and name , and make it a profitable venue . cheap carpet , sound baffles/curtains , high top tables , new paint in the lobby would make this a place worth seeing a show in . i will try to avoid the marquee at all costs , its too bad there is no where else for midlevel bands to play here .		2		0
chile , please . you call that barbeque ??? -lrb- snort -rrb- and they definitely aint soul food . they are in a misplaced category . take it from a soul sista with a southern mama , unh uh ... it was probably back in 2001 the first and only time i ate there . i could n't even finish my bbq pork sandwich , i was that disappointed . for those who hail from states to the east of arizona , you 'll know just what i mean . sorry , honey bears . just keeping it real !		2		0

what is going on here ?!?! the last few times i have gone into lee lee they do n't have what i want . they never have clams anymore and they did n't have the shrimp i wanted or the live dungeness crabs . every time i come in here i always have to go to mekong to get what i really want . so from now on i 'm just going straight to mekong . get it together lee lee !		2		0
really 2.5 stars , and with some small changes , it could be 3.5 stars . i do n't come here for the food -lrb- with one exception -rrb- and i wish i was driven to come here for the beer -- but so far , i 'm not . the beer is ok , but nothing stands out , and for now , this is a big for now , the beer is not made in house , but that will change soon . being an ipa lover , i am stunned that their ipa has the lowest ibus , at 17 , among their 4 beers -lrb- ipa , pale ale , lager , oatmeal stout -rrb- . i 'm at a loss on the ipa -lrb- and yes , i did get all beer geek on you -rrb- . i do n't need 90 minute ipa levels , but i 'd like to taste my hops . that said , the ipa has good flavor . the staff is friendly and usually a blast to hang out with , although it appears turnover is high -lrb- yes , i know , shocking -rrb- . i 've had some great nights and afternoons just chatting with people -lrb- including watching some marines in from ca hit on every woman that moved ... it was one of the few times that i was actually rooting for the guys -rrb- . it is a nice , although slightly awkward space , because of a front room that makes no sense . still , it has a bar that opens to the outside and a nice patio . the food is slow and average on a good day . however , the sausage/bratwurst sampler is awesome , but i 'm not sure it is on the menu all the time . and let me tell you , if you play hide the brat with me , i 'm not down . ultimately , i would hang out here more often if the establishment had cared about a small error that was made with one of my credit receipts -lrb- and the beer was better -rrb- . basically , a $ 7 + $ 3 tip receipt was run for $ 40 instead of $ 10 . i informed them and left a note with my bank record for the manager . she never called and the error was never fixed . consistent with the nice staff , the bartender did comp me a beer when i told her the story . given the good location , i 'm sure dave 's can survive , i just hope the beer improves .		2		0
we tried this out last night . we wo n't be back . there is no indication when you walk in that it 's a seat-yourself restaurant . we stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something . we sat ourselves , and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us . perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons , so a server knows they 've arrived ? finally , the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us , and she was very polite and took our order . our drinks came out fairly quickly , but then we waited and waited for our food . this would have been understandable if the placed had been packed , but it was n't . it was maybe 75 % full -lrb- 7:30 on saturday -rrb- and there seemed to be plenty of servers . there was one large party on the patio . i ordered the vegetarian salad -lrb- ca n't remember what it was called -rrb- that advertised avocado , jicama , beans , and other yummy things . when it arrived , there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top , and no more to be found . it was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad . it would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether . also , the white beans were undercooked . the pizzas were good . i ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese , and it came loaded with summer squash , roasted carrots , olives -lrb- local ? hmm ... -rrb- , leeks , roasted onions , and the crust was thin and crispy . my husband also enjoyed his pizza . i should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress , who comped my salad when i complained about it . i was willing to pay for it , but she offered to take it off the bill . the final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant , but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there . if ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners ' experiences , then i 'm afraid it 's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in . no such luck . anyway , this place has some things to work on . fortunately for us , there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance .		2		0
i usually love this place . really good breakfast burritos and tacos . however today i found a short curly black hair nestled in my machaca burrito and had to throw it away immediately and now i feel ill . this really sucks since i liked this place a lot and its the closest burrito place but now i can not eat there anymore . i did see someone not wearing a hairnet in the kitchen , please up your health standards .		2		0
after dining here last thursday , i would classify this as a `` special occasion '' place due to the prices and ambiance ; this was a surprise since i did not get that impression when reading the reviews . or maybe it was because the couple of other jamaican places i have been to have been dives ? i loved the classy intimacy of this restaurant . it gave me the feeling that i was having dinner at someone 's house who was both a great cook and also had great taste in decor . the impression i have of jamaican food is that it has really strong flavors but i found the food here to be a little bland . i got the jerk shrimp which did n't look very blackened or like it even had a rub on it . however , when i tasted it i was surprised and pleased that there was actually a good spicy kick to it . this was by far the best part of my meal . the sides it came with tasted good but were nothing special . i did really love their cocktails but i wrote another review of the bar since that is a separate business listing . i like the fact that there was so much seafood on the menu -lrb- try the mussels , they are yummy -rrb- but i think someone who is more of a meat eater might be disappointed . i was also surprised there was no goat on the menu - do n't jamaican places usually have goat ? overall , i think this is a great place for a date night or a quiet dinner with old friends . the food just was n't special enough for me to want to drive into downtown . but if i knew someone who wanted to go here , i would n't say no .		2		0
if amc , the $ 1 cinema and denny 's were able to birth a baby from a menage a trois , it 'd be this . farrelli 's shows not so new yet not too old movies while serving mediocre food . it was very distracting to watch a movie while servers walked throughout the area serving denny 's quality food . i took a few bites of my food and left it . i 've managed to repress the memory of what i ate so i 'm sorry i ca n't warn you all about it . the concept of dinner & a movie , at the same time , is awesome , but unfortunately , they failed to deliver .		2		0
worth checking out the view -lrb- and the slide -rrb- but everything -- from appetizers to drinks to entrees -- is drastically overpriced ! if you have money to burn and are looking for kitsch , this is your spot . otherwise , pick some place else ...		2		0
here i was thinking for some bizarre reason that their carne asada would be better than morenos or mi casita in chandler and boy was i wrong . i had come here for -lrb- street tacos -rrb- carne asada tacos hoping i would find another joyous mexican place i would be fond of . their carne asada had a very weird texture or lack of i should say with very little flavor or crispiness in the slightest its almost like they boiled it and threw it on the stove and swished it around til it got hot but not crisp obviously . if their carne asada was amazing id be in heaven with how ginormous the size of those things are . i wish someone would have warned me that they are no where near street taco size they are like street tacos on steroids . i am in love with the usual street tacos because my stomach will only allow a max of 3 in my stomach at a time . the pico de gallo has a lot of minced jalapenos so beware . my spicy tolerance is slowly diminishing where i can no longer handle extreme heat like that . i do happen to like their red sauce though it is spicy enough for me to handle to dip my not as spicy food into to add the heat with each bite . not much to really say besides i wasted a lot of money for two tacos . so overpriced and the longest wait known to man for 2 tacos . 30 minutes for 2 tacos is crazy . i understand you are busy but 30 minutes really ? i doubt ill ever return to this establishment .		2		0
some days are good , some days are bad . i have experienced the good and the bad of pasand . i have experienced great service and horrible service from the same person . when my family and i first tried pasand , we had a very family warming type experience . the food was exceptional as we each tried a variety of north and south indian foods . there was also a time where the server took the food out too late and the dosas turned out cold . he did not offer to refire another one . in another experience , my dad got sick the next day . it is hard to dine some where when you do n't know how it will turn out .		2		0
i 'm not one to usually complain and you can see that on my review history but this place offers terrible terrible service , slow service -lrb- they were n't busy -rrb- and overpriced food and drinks . was n't impressed w / the food and for sure will never return .		2		0
i feel the need to explain my 2-star rating , because i come here with regularity . every so often i just jones for an emerald chicken quesadilla , smothered in their salsa . the service is hit & miss . there is one particular employee who is awful , the rest are okay - very friendly . but communication is not their strong suit . for example , one day i tried to order a rice bowl with a quesadilla . they did not tell me that i ca n't have a quesadilla with a rice bowl , so i ended up with emerald chicken over rice - no quesadilla . no warning , or i 'd have changed my order . they also refused to fix my existing order , they told me i 'd have to put in a new order for a quesadilla - no refund on the rice bowl i did n't want . just today , i put in a to-go order and came home to find they put something ... not emerald chicken , i do n't know what it is - in my quesadilla . in their defense , they were busy , and i 'm sure it 's hard to tell what 's in a quesadilla . just disappointing when literally , that is the only reason i go there . many people seem to love their fried rice - i do n't think it 's anything special . likewise with the beans - they are good , not spectacular . i love the jade red chicken and the diablo chicken . the pork tends to be too fatty for my tastes . the cookies are okay . the salsa is something special -lrb- do n't miss it - they put it in a big container by the fountain drink dispenser -rrb- , i love it and if they sold it in jars i 'd probably buy it . the good news is that i did find the emerald chicken recipe online http://www.foodieslikeusblog.com/recipes/guy-fieri-dishes-on-tattoos-foodies-and-changing-lives/ -lrb- allll the way at the bottom -rrb- and i 've made it - it really does replicate it well ! the bad news is that 80 % of the time i 'm too lazy to make it myself ... so back to chino bandido i go . ps - every so often ... they run out of chicken . really , it 's the weirdest thing to me . how does a restaurant run out of chicken ? but it 's happened 3 times to me here . since i go there for the chicken dishes , i just leave when that happens . pps - i really hope the chino staff does n't see my review and muck with my food next time i go ... i need a yelp alias .		2		0
cool : funky retro furniture that looks like it could be from the 60s . not cool : furniture that is so dirty it actually looks like it 's from the 60s and has been sitting in my parent 's basement for two decades . cafe zuzu -- clean your freaking booths . the first thing i noticed after sitting down here this morning was that the brown polyester upholstery on my chair was stained with -- milk ? and then , looking around , i noticed the walls of many of the booths -lrb- same fabric -rrb- were also stained . the carpets were full of crumbs and food , too . that 's what i expect from i-hop , not the valley ho . my husband and i ate here for easter brunch , but were overall disappointed . the menu ? boring . the prices ? ok , but a bit high for what you 're getting . the service ? slow . the decor ? very cool . i 'll admit , i enjoyed sitting in the cafe with glass walls that were open to the pool and the cool decorations . but that was about it . the menu was all things like `` denver omelet '' `` bacon and mushroom omelet '' `` scrambled eggs with grits '' `` pancakes '' -- what is this , a breakfast join in fargo or something ? really , that 's the best you can do ? i really wanted french toast , but the only option zuzu offered was `` cranberry and walnut '' - which seemed a little seasonal . as in , not the springtime season . so i settled for the eggs and grits . the grits were really good . the eggs were ... well ... scrambled eggs . they were fine , and all , pretty tasty -- but that 's it . i guess i just expected something more . i was under the impression that this place was supposed to put a `` twist '' on the typical `` comfort foods '' -- but they seemed to forget to add the twist . i could have had a far more creative brunch at home .		2		0
was it just an off night ? i had high hopes for this place and was sorely disappointed . went on a monday and the place was dead . i know my fellow yelpers may stone me for this review but here goes : to start - i found the décor to look a bit cheesy , like design on a dime but they only spent a nickel . . what 's up with the glass jars full of paper confetti ? the music was too loud and the lights kept getting darker and darker , by the time we got our food we could barely see . our waitress was nice and recommended her favorites . so many people have raved about this place , but i found the fusion either bland or overspiced . shabu hot and sour was served first - this soup had no spice to it at all , even the side dipping sauce provided had no spice . the lime broth , while providing nice flavor to the veggies was too overpowering to eat , so we just picked out all the veggies . spicy wontons came out next - chicken and pepper jack . . this tasted as though it had been frozen for ages , no flavor and very little amount of chicken . volcano beef - nice touch on the `` sear it yourself '' hot rock . we could see the beef was marinated , but we could n't taste it and the garnish accompanying it was loaded with too much ginger . at this point we were so disappointed with the food , and still hungry . we left and walked down the street to moira , another disappointment . review to follow .		2		0
i was so excited when the new location finally opened in mesa . i have been a loyal fan of beaver choice , and have highly recommended to all my friends to try it . tonight , i was extremely disappointed at the whole dining experience . we had all placed our orders at the same time . the waitress indicated that the kitchen was behind and it will take about 5-10 minutes to put the ticket inside . we agreed . another friend came after we just placed the order , sat over 20 minutes without any type of service -lrb- no water or even a menu -rrb- . she had to get up to ask for them . i know you have expanded but might just need to hire more staff to help on weekends . we all had to ask for refills many times . after 1/2 hour of waiting , we noticed the tables around came after us got their food even few ate and left . i felt it was a deja vu moment reminded me the very first time i visited in the tempe location . they had lost our ticket and we waited over an hour too . however , the owner came out to our table to apologize . this time when the owner came around to chat , we mentioned we have not received our food and indicated that tables around already ate and left . by now , it 's over an hour ! we are very patient people , others would have left by now . the owner came back with our waitress showing us the time that the waitress placed our orders on the pos receipt . we knew we had placed the orders way before time indicated on the receipt . the owner kept telling us they prepare it freshly and will take time to cook . again , i was loyal customer so i should know how long a normal schnitzel takes . over 1 hour is just unacceptable ! i felt i was in the episode of amy 's baking company when the owner accused the customers they were wrong . i know the owner here is not amy and sammy . the family working in this establishment are much better than that . i really hope tonight was just an one-time incident .		2		0
so sad that i have to change my 4 star review to 2 stars . both of my reviews are below : updated review -- i went to lolo 's today for lunch , and i 'm not sure what was going on with them , but they were definitely off their game . every time i have been to this location of lolo 's the service is always on top of everything . today , not so much . where do i start ? -lrb- 1 -rrb- we had to hunt someone down to take our order . -lrb- 2 -rrb- the fried chicken was not seasoned well . -lrb- 3 -rrb- the grits were clumpy and lukewarm . -lrb- 4 -rrb- we had to ask for our check twice . and then on top of that , we were seated literally right next to the restroom . they should really reconsider that setup as it is not appetizing to eat while people are going in out and of out of the bathroom . just the thought that airborne germs were drifting through the air everytime they opened and closed the door just grosses me out . it just seemed like the kids who wait tables there had absolutely no management or direction . what a disappointment . original review -- as always , the chicken and waffles were delicious , along with the cold , sweet lemonade ! however , i was more than disappointed in the red velvet cake , which was surprising because it was delicious the last time i had it . it was extremely dry and just tasted like a white cake with red food coloring . if not for the disappointing red velvet cake , i would have given 5 stars !		2		0

between fair and good . we went here on a friday night . i had short ribs , which were a big pile off the bone and recommended by the server , huge portion , tasty , and in general pretty good -lrb- i shared with everone and they were a hit with young and old -rrb- . my wife had the tuna , which was at best average . i 'm terrible cooking fish , and i do better . what shined were the side dishes . i dislike cornbread normally , but the cornbread caserole was filling and outstanding . the mashed potatoes with cheddar tasted several hours old , but still were good . my wife tried the cornbread and like it , but also tried the carrots and said they were very , very plain and disappointing . children had standard fair chicken fingers and fries for $ 5 . other option was buttered pasta . ca n't complain about the price , but it would be nice if they had something a little healthier or interesting for the kids , like a very small portion of the short-ribs , which my kids loved . so here is the verdict ... setting was pretty nice , especially in the enclosed patio , but food was just okay for an upscale restaurant , and in general overpriced . for $ 20-30 entrees , i expect tastier better food . however , quantities were nice . use your gps , because it 's easy to get lost finding this place . just when you are about to turn around because it 's residential , look to your right and it 's there . would i be back ? perhaps . i would like to try the happy hour -lrb- we just missed it -rrb- and try greater variety . but i think there are definitely much better options in this price range in this portion of phoenix -lrb- for example , sierra bonita grill up the street comes to mind -rrb- .		2		0
just okay for my taste , the one thing i do like is that you can go crazy with what you decide you want to have them cook up for ya !! you simply , pick your choice of meat , choice of seasoning , veggies , sauce and starch and you hand it over to the cook , that then they heat it up for you in their gigantic grill and ta da , it is all ready for you to enjoy !! the one thing that i honestly do n't really like is the price , it could definitely be adjusted , it is a bit over-priced for the portioned you get and that is without a drink , if they included your drink of choice then i would then be content !!		2		0
= = = = = = this review is for the weekday lunch buffet = = = = = = i 'll admit that as a meatie i 'm a tough customer to impress at these veggie buffets , but madras ananda bhavan managed to pull it off , & so did cafe krishna , yesterday . by comparison i thought udupi café here was weak . this is a mid-sized restaurant with a simple but ok decor . there are tables only , no booths , which would have been my preference . the host was friendly but the smell of incense burning was sure to interfere with the taste of the food , & it did . over at the serving tables , there were 15 food items plus sauces & dressings . i was also brought an ok tasting masada dosa with curried potatoes , & offered another one during my meal . the next issue was that the sambar soup was barely warm , & most everything else that should have been hot was not up to temperature either . -lrb- if they 're worried about people burning their fingers on the little stainless steel bowls , replace them with china or melmac ones ! duh ? -rrb- the rasam soup was better , & there was salad as well as some puffy chips something like the ones the mexican kids sell from tricycle carts around town . they were labeled papadum , but they were n't that . the dall curry was pretty good but mostly everything was just `` there '' ... neither particularly good nor bad . most of the dishes overall were labeled properly as far as i know , & vegan recipes were identified . sorry udupi fans , for me this one was a bit of a dud . weekday lunch buffet recently reduced to $ 7.99 ; closed tuesday .		2		0
oh here we go again ... a `` trendy '' well appointed spot in central phoenix that seems to place more focus on the decor and drink menu than the food . here 's the thing , if i 'm ordering tapas -lrb- small bites -rrb- and i am paying the same price i would for a full sized entree ... i would expect these miniscule morsels to be amazing . they , unequivocally , were not . seems like people are fooled by this concept and the flashiness of the place . i have been to a similar restaurant in mahattan , and you know ? they lived up to the hype . i appreciate the concept , and bringing this to phoenix -- but the cooks can do better . much better . chicken - overcooked/dry fish - overpriced , fishy tasting/super breaded . ribs - very fatty ... i suppose had we ordered main entrees instead of the tapas we would have been more impressed ? i am unsure . but i tend to like more authentic asian spots . i appreciate classic flavors and home cooking . meh . a shame because the place has a very cool vibe .		2		0
meh . sorry to be a hater , but i 've eaten here several times , always expecting the food here to wow me , and i always leave somewhat dissatisfied . i like the concept of pita jungle - fresh , healthy , middle-eastern influenced . but there 's just something in the execution of their dishes that does n't seem to jive with my palate . i always leave wanting more flavor from the food , and to eat something a little more authentically middle eastern i guess . the last time i ate here was for breakfast , and the omelet i had , while humongous , did n't really satisfy my taste buds , while the coffee that was served was super bitter , even after drowning it in cream and sugar .		2		0
i started a new job and the bosses brought us here for lunch . it was ok . i got a lunch combo meal , but i did n't pay . the service was really great but the food was not . just kind of plain . it 's convenient to work , so i will probably be back , i just wo n't have very high expectations .		2		0
not very impressed with our experience . the cheese plate was just ok , a girlfriend got the cucumber soup which was wonderful , the main course was ok at best , for dessert i got a cheese fritter which was good . overall i was n't very impressed with noca . our waitress was slow even for as busy as it was . there was a time period i was without a drink for 20 + mins . cool setting just not really worth the price .		2		0
scale of 1-10 -lrb- single visit -rrb- : 5 food 6 service 7 atmosphere 8 value by no means the best sushi . though weird as this sounds , grab some creme puffs ! those are great ! but probably just from costco . they were also unable to figure out when we were done eating -lrb- lots of stacked empty plates with no one left eating ? -rrb- , so the payout was slow . and during lunch table turns should be fast b/c people have to get back to work . here 's the cool part : you do n't -lrb- but you can -rrb- order off a menu . you grab covered food off a conveyor belt that rides around the restaurant . apparently this is common in japan . i 'd never experienced this before . and the items are cheap -lrb- $ 1 - $ 2 -rrb- , so you kind of just grab what tickles your fancy .		2		0
i 'm somewhat new to arizona , so when relatives from out of town said they had heard of this place on the food network and knew what they needed to do to get in , i figured why not ? we get off work and head over to meet them at 5:00 , when the place opens . there is a small valet lot -lrb- full -rrb- and a public parking garage -lrb- $ 12.00 -rrb- which the restaurant will validate -lrb- only $ 9.00 , though , you still have to cough up $ 3.00 -rrb- . our dinner companions already had a table inside which was great because there was a huge crowd outside . inside , the restaurant is teeny-tiny , with maybe six tables that seat four or more , a few tables that seat two , and a bar area where people can eat . the bathrooms are one-at-a-time only and the ladies ' toilet did not flush properly . i scanned the menu and quickly realized that they serve pizza and some salads - that 's it . so if you have any dietary restrictions you 're pretty much f * cked . while we are waiting for our food to arrive my dining companions inform me that they showed up at 3:00 to secure a table . three ?!??! and they were n't the first in line either ! what ? bread comes and it is homemade and delicious , with a crispy-outside , spongy-inside thing going on , and the inside was the best - soft and delicious with huge swiss-cheese-like bubbles -lrb- do n't know how else to so eloquently put it -rrb- . then drink refills come . no one else is being served -lrb- so they fire up these orders to order , not bad , okay -rrb- . i did n't have salad but they looked pretty good - buffalo mozarella and fresh basil , huge slices of tomato for the caprese . kalamatas on the baby greens salad . pizza comes out , finally ! $ 12 each for personal-sized pizzas with thin crust . the four-cheese was great ; you can really taste the separate flavors of the cheeses . arugula on top . a couple of the pizzas had salami or sausage on them . too salty -lrb- and i love salt so yeah , that 's saying a lot if even i am critical on that point -rrb- . one pizza 's crust was not burned but charred black on half of it . but it 's food so it ca n't be perfect every time now can it . a table of two finished/paid/left . they were the first people to finish from the first wave of customers and it was after 6:00 pm when this happened , and there was still a shitload of people outside . meaning that if you do n't line up at 3:00 to get in at 5:00 , the soonest you can be seated is after 6:00 -lrb- and that 's likely if you showed up between 3:30 and 4:00 for a table -rrb- . here 's where it gets tricky - we paid , but were finishing our drinks . we were not the only ones there taking up a first-wave table who had n't left yet . and after paying $ 150 for pizza -lrb- give me a break , please -rrb- the hostess came over and asked us to clear out because `` people waiting outside are getting upset . '' hey , i can see how that sucks for them but we 're customers too and so is everyone else around us who have been lounging around for this long . when we exited the restaurant the people waiting outside were giving us -lrb- and everyone else who was leaving -rrb- dirty looks . bitch please - it was your decision to come here and wait in this ridiculous line , for one . for two - the food is n't that great anyway . would i ever come here again ? hell no would i ever wait in a line that long for anything , not even if they sprinkled diamonds on the overly-salty meats . oh , and i woke up twice in the middle of the night feeling like my face was caving in on itself and had to get up to go drink water .		2		0
so we 've been hearing all sorts of buzz about culver 's . . the famous butter burger and frozen custard place from wisconsin . so we piled in the car and headed out to mesa . when we got there the place was packed . . we stood in line for 10 minutes before it was our turn . the service is very friendly and super helpful . we even ordered the flavor of the day , caramel cashew swirls and were told we could pick that up later so it did n't melt while we ate our dinner . . that was very cool ! anyway , you place your order and they give you a number so they can bring it out to you when its ready . . another nice touch . well after we got our food , butter burgers , fries and cheese curds we felt well , kind of let down . the burgers here are alright , kinda greasy and lacked a good beef flavor . the cheese curds were also deep fried -lrb- as most on the menu -rrb- and were good but not as good as i was hoping . the crowd there . . it was like i was in iowa or something . . definite walmart crowd . . i sat there and watched this kid pick his nose and then proceed to fill his soda cup from the soft drink fountain . . uhm , yeah . . i just looked at my cup and thought about all the other people who touched that button . . suddenly did n't feel very good . we got our frozen custards . . eh , very very smooth and creamy but to me just tasted like ordinary soft serve ice cream . cashews were salty and nicely roasted , a good contrast to the smooth custard but lack depth and interest in the overall taste of the frozen custard . i probably would n't ever go back here . . though the service is great and is priced well , i just do n't think the food was worth the drive back out to mesa .		2		0
had the bean burro . ca n't really mess up beans , but their hot sauce is too tomato-ey and not spicy enough .		2		0
01/27/11 yes , the mango fish rolls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=kklpgd3aa5bpvwdonaufyg#kklpgd3aa5bpvwdonaufyg were definitely crispy and tasted delicious , and yes , the oven-roasted plantains http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=q-jpbnwkko0gme66g9w2ta#q-jpbnwkko0gme66g9w2ta were firm on the outside and just-like-buttah on the inside , but were they worth $ 10.50 and $ 5 , plus tax , respectively ? i do n't think so . i took photos of the food w / a pen next to the plates to show you how small these portions were . really , $ 12 for a small mango fish roll , sliced three-ways ? and i 'm supposed to feel good about ordering an entree and dessert after ? the sweet potato pudd 'n http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-breadfruit-phoenix-2?select=ghufceowcgwschxrw8zmva#ghufceowcgwschxrw8zmva was just absolutely fabulous , but you wo n't catch me driving all the way to the breadfruit to spend my hard-earned money here . at least i know they 've reinvested some of the profits into remodeling the place ... it looked fifty times better than when it did on its first year of opening . if you wish to dine and converse w / your companions , it 's best not to come here on the weekends , when next door rum bar is hopping . then again , maybe it was just hopping on this night , bec . of the rum-tasting event held there ... i have n't been back since , so i do n't know how busy these two businesses are .		2		0
i really want to like cheba hut ... i just ca n't do it . i 've been trying it again and again for some nine years now and i have decided it 's just not going to work . the sandwiches are too bready and often too toasted making the bread hard , sure they have cute little names but they just are n't impressive . i genuinely like the meatball sub ... i do n't remember what they call it ... the weedinator or something probably . but the decor is too much , the weed theme is taken too far , the staff seem to pick and choose who they 're going to be friendly to and the food just is n't anything to write home about .		2		0
after a long day of busting my ass i wanted to find a place where i can unwind by indulging my taste buds . i have a few spots near tempe that are trustworthy when it comes to fulfilling my desires , but its always better to expand your circle of friends . i decided to do just that . mexican food , pizza , burgers are all great , but sometimes you just want something that 's not run of the mill . i wanted gyros , but like i said i wanted to try something new because i 've been to haji baba far too many times and phoenicia is a bit too pricey for me . a gyro sandwich plus fries for $ 5.99 sounded like a really good deal ... except that the gyro was very sub par . i was expecting something that was sliced fresh off the rotisserie , and instead got what seemed to be frozen meat cooked on a grill . if i wanted that stuff , i could have made it at home . thanks for the offer , but i do n't think i will be coming here again . the food was n't completely inedible , and the service was certainly pretty good . that 's probably the only reason i gave it a 2 star rating . i 'm not into hookah , and i do n't mind the smell , but it did n't add to the experience . although , if for some ridiculous reason i did want to smoke hookah , this place seemed pretty cool because it looks like they are the hookah kings of tempe , never seen that many hookahs in my life . i do n't think i will be returning here . probably better off trying haji baba or phoenica .		2		0
we had a 60 + person luncheon event here and i 'd say the service and food were marginal . for example , i made the mistake of ordering my salad with dressing on the side . this caused 59 people to be served and one to sit and wait at least 15 minutes for lettuce and tomato assembly . these guys may be fine for dinner , but i 'd never do another group event . they were a pain in the butt to deal with .		2		0
i 've been a loyal nordy 's customer for years . i even worked there for about four years in the past . in recent years , it sure seems their customer service is slipping . men 's rail never has been a department i 've recognized for their customer service . it was never bad service by any means , it just was n't nordstrom quality service . i 've felt no sense of loyalty with any associate in that department becuase , thought friendly , they never seemed to care much . it 's the department i do the majority of my nordstrom shopping , but no one ever remembers me from my previous shopping trip -lrb- no matter how recent -rrb- , i 've never been sent a thank-you card , and though i have asked numerous times , i 've never been called about sales or new items . i will describe my last couple visits to the rail . earlier this year i was rummaging through a sale rack . i was completely ignored , while the three associates there helped customers who were perusing the regular priced racks . not only that , but two female associates were talking about one of the sale shirts -lrb- that i was holding in my hand -rrb- . one girl said she was n't sure if she liked it , she 'd have to see it on her boyfriend , but it might be `` too ugly '' for her to let him wear . the other girl replied `` yeah , the color is a little gay . '' now , they were n't talking about it because it was in my hand , and i do n't feel they were homophobi my last visit started the most recent string of events that really have left me questioning any future shopping at the store . i had another pair of jeans i brought in for a repair . i was again offered an exchange but i was insistant on the rapair because i really loved them and they did n't have them anymore . i was wanting a small tear repaired and was originally planning on shipping them out to new york to have them rewoven . i instead opted to try nordstrom , hoping to save a few bucks -lrb- atleast the cost of shipping to and from nyc -rrb- . well i was shocked when the associate asked the manager how to ring it up and she said to do it as `` customer 's own goods , no charge '' . i told her the jeans are a couple years old , it 's just from wear and tear , not a defect . i was told not to worry about it and needless to say i was very excited . i was planning on spending about $ 20-25 for the repair . i asked how the repair would be done and they said they would be rewoven . even better ! so i clarified that they would be actually rewoven and not patched . i was told yes , that was correct . so they took them in and gave me the date of 6/4 that i could come in and pick them up . well that date came and went . i was so busy i did n't get a chance to go get them . no big deal , i was n't in a rush . on 6/12 , the associate that had helped me originally called me about the jeans asking if i had wanted them shortened . i said no , just the repair that i brought them in for . he did n't know what repair and i described what i wanted . he told me he just found the original slip , the pants had not been touched yet , but he would put a rush on it and ship them to me for no extra charge . he said i should get them by saturday or monday . well that did n't happen . i called this past thursday and spoke with the department manager and explained the situation . he said he was the only one on the floor but would look for them and call me back later that day . that did n't happen either . i called back the next day . he tells me `` i 'm sorry , you must not have gotten my message . '' well of course i did n't get your message ! you did n't call me so you obviously did n't leave me a message either ! well that is what i wanted to say . but i was nice . he said the jeans were going out that day . that did happen and i got them the following day !! thankfully they had not been shortened , but they also were not rewoven . they were patched and then stitched over the patch . i 'm annoyed , but the thread they used is a perfect match and they did do a good job . the work is very subtle and hardly noticeable . this is just not the level of service i would expect from this store , regardless of what department i am in . i know i probably should n't complain about a free service , but i did n't expect or ask for it to be free ...		2		0
the only good thing is the cheesecake . the food is terribly mediocre . and i hate how they seem to all be decorated like ruins of some sort . i want some damn food not an expedition with fernando !		2		0
i do n't get this place . . i seriously think i could go to the store , get the same type of ingredients and make a similar sandwich for less money . i know there are lots of different sandwiches here that you can try . i suppose i prefer a place that has a select few sandwiches that are really good opposed to a lot of choices with ok flavor . the bread is seriously the cheap kind you can get at the store . it comes with a cookie which does n't taste like anything special . lots of people like it here and i ca n't say anything really ... negative happened . i just wo n't be back .		2		0
my work was offering discounts for this restaurant and since i had been here roughly 5 years ago , and loved it , i thought it would be fun to take my boyfriend here for dinner . so i purchased one of the gift certificates being offered and we visited the mesa location last night . unfortunately , it seems the food and quality has really plummeted since my last visit . service was subpar . while our server did get us everything we needed in a timely manner she was n't friendly at all . she seemed bored and almost put off by having to even be there . the food was ... eh . i 'm pretty sure our second bowl of chips were left over 's from another table . when we first arrived we were given a bowl of very warm chips . as we ran out i watched a manager clear off a table from customers who has just left but they had a full bowl of chips on the table . i watched the manager walk back to the kitchen and within a minute or so our server walked out with a bowl of chips . when i grabbed one it was cold . this tells me the chips on our table did n't come from the same place as the first bowl of warm chips . we did n't touch anymore chips . i 'm 100 % sure that the shrimp i was given was frozen , and then possibly microwaved . it definitely was n't freshly cooked shrimp as it was bland , and rubbery . the refried beans are unquestionably canned instead of made fresh . they had that same dry texture and metal taste as the canned variety . my boyfriends carne asada burrito was just that ; cooked beef wrapped in a tortilla . no salsa , no sour cream or beans , no onions , no peppers or tomatoes . nothing was in this tortilla except for cooked beef . i 've never seen a burrito that did n't have any other elements to it other than meat . it was strange . we tried the fried ice cream for dessert and they did n't even bother to crush the corn flakes , they just stuck them onto the ice cream whole before slightly frying . since the cornflakes did n't fry all the way this gave it a terrible , thick , and yet almost stale type of texture . it looked very appealing but it truly was a disappointment compared to other fried ice creams i 've had . had it not been for the $ 25 off we would have definitely complained to the manager . we wo n't be going back nor will we purchase anymore coupons from my work for this restaurant . quality and service is just too low compared to the prices they have listed . there are better mexican restaurants around to choose from .		2		0
ok , i 'll admit that this place is too upscale to be in my wheelhouse . so snooty fine diners can ignore this review and go back to your $ 100 bottles of wine and your pasta in a spinach and black truffle reduction sauce . the rest of you , pay attention . we had headed to tempe for the day thanks to the power of the light rail . after a few hours of walking up and down mill , the gf decided she needed a ` snack ' before schlepping back to phx . we both felt like wine so we happened into caffe boa . in the history of bad ideas this does n't rate very high , but its still the equivalent of a kick to the crotch . the biggest complaint was that our service was awful . and not just ` we 're not being paid enough attention ' awful , but ` why are you making us feel like we do n't belong here ? ' awful . we were n't dressed any more poorly than most of the people here . we 're young and good looking enough not to be treated with disdain anyway . and did i say the biggest complaint was the service ? i should take that back , since our ` snack ' set us back $ 50 . for a bottle of wine and a shared appetizer -lrb- both of which were pretty good , i will admit . -rrb- so i guess i could try the boa again and get a different experience , but it really felt like it went beyond just a bad waiter thing . but hey , if uptight and snooty is your thing , who am i to throw stones -lrb- even though i just kinda did -rrb- .		2		0
this place brings out strong feelings among some of my friends . my opinion ? it 's fun , and kinda gives me a `` i brought sexy back '' feeling because i hosted fondue parties in high school for my friends . back then no one understood fondue . now they pay big $ for it . i was fondue before fondue was cool . but anyhow ... one friend believes that this is the most fun ever . she loves this place like almost nothing else as a place to have a girls night . another friend thinks it 's ok , but unless you get one of the tables with the pot inside of it , it 's not so great . my lactose intolerant but cheese loving friend thinks it 's the devil . she blames it for having an entire cheese course in front of her for 20 minutes so of course she had to eat it . and as someone who carpooled with her on that occasion , i agreed . and yet another friend thinks it 's the biggest rip off she 's ever seen . i think it went something like this : her : so , they are giving you cut up veggies and stuff and you dip it into melted cheese ? are they special veggies , or just what you could get at the store ? me : um , just normal . her : and they bring out raw meat for you to cook yourself ? me : um , yea ... her : and if you forget which thing touched the raw meat and you end up putting that in your mouth it 's not their fault if you die because they told you to be careful ? me : i guess her : and this costs how much ??? and it was at that point that she and i were on the same page . so it can be fun , or evil or both -lrb- especially the chocolate course ! oh yea !!! -rrb- but in the end there is a part of you that wonders why you paid all the money and did almost all the work . and for a 3 course meal , you could be there 2 hours easily . fine if the date is going good , or you are w / good friends , but not a good place for those `` how soon will this be over '' kind of dates ...		3		0
just ate here again last night and had the shrimp scampi pasta , which was impressive , but i did have to add salt . something is just lacking here . ambience and portions and quality of the food ingredients are all great , but the food just is missing some kind of splash of flavor that would make it different and/or better than i could make myself at home . the shrimp , however , were huge and the addition of cilantro in the dish added a nice twist .		3		0
this place has all the amazing potential in the world . it 's a cool concept and i certainly appreciate the plethora of vegetarian and vegan options they have available , but i got ta say : bland , boring , blah . the hummus was good , but certainly not the `` best in the valley '' as our waiter purported . i ended up adding salt . my `` ltl '' -lrb- veggie version of the blt -rrb- was very bland . i added salt and that did n't even help . my bread was slightly burned and the potato hash that they gave as a side was cold , limp and you could tell it was burned during the cooking process . the vegan pizza was also pretty boring . it was a combo of olive oil and red sauce . they could have spruced it up with some spices and made it really flavorful , but it definitely left me wanting for more . i appreciate the charcoal water filtration system that helps eliminate `` water bottle waste '' but i do n't know that charging $ 2 for the table is necessary . the honey lemonade was good but gave me a tummy ache , and the nojito just had way too much going on -lrb- honey , lime , ginger , soda water , etc -rrb- . our service was good , if not a little overbearing , otherwise i would give this place 2 stars . the food is boring and extremely overpriced . our casual lunch turned into $ 50 , and there was no alcohol involved . i am all for health and i support the cause , but they really need to do something about the taste of the dishes .		3		0
here is where my best food friend -lrb- bff ... to me -rrb- and i disagree : classic italian pizza . i think it is alright . it definitely is a place that supports my `` treasure hunt '' hypothesis to finding great stuff in the phx -lrb- for crying out loud , it is next to a big lots ! -rrb- . i 've been here three times , at least -lrb- 1 : with bff , 2 : with a date who said he gave a former student/girfriend an `` a for the lay '' - yeah , that was the 1st and only date - . 3 : with mom and step dad -rrb- . i do n't know -- i appreciate the wood fired oven , the totally sweet staff , and the bread , but the food just does n't quite cut the mustard for me . i suppose all those years in rome -lrb- okay , those two years in rome -rrb- really amped up my snob factor . i would take a picky date here in the future -- because it has good date atmosphere , i could n't date anyone who could n't support the th hypothesis , and who does n't at least like pizza ?		3		0
this place is so cute . i love the location and the decor . too bad the service was kind of weird and the food was iffy . not bad . just iffy . the first thing everyone mentions about lisa g is thier meatballs . the meatballs are okay but not all that . i tried them after hearing everyone rant and rave and was a bit dissapointed . they were n't bad - just not the amazing experience i 've heard about . my sandwhich was not that great either . i will say that my dining partners really enjoyed thier food and were quite happy with thier experience . in summary - i do n't love the place but most other people do . to each his own .		3		0
i will start by saying that my favorite part of lee 's is by far the french baguettes . being an east coast transplant , it 's hard to find good bread -lrb- by which i mean chewy interior , crusty-but-not-stale exterior -rrb- . this place has done a great job and i will likely return just for that . i tried the bahn mi , since it seems to be a house specialty , and i found it lacking flavor . the roast beef & cheese was better , although i tasted cheese more than the thin amount of roast beef they put on . next time i 'd order extra meat . i ca n't complain at the prices either , $ 3 - $ 5 for a sandwich is good , and $ 1.25 for a baguette to take home is better than local grocery stores in price and flavor . thanks to those who warned about no refills -lrb- i went to circle k across the street for a soda -rrb- and the cash only environment .		3		0
threw a friend 's baby shower here and it went pretty smoothly . we made reservations well in advance , and it was a small party . i 'm not a huge fan of their food but it 's always busy so clearly other people do n't have my same opinion . the three stars is for the service , they were super attentive and everything was taken care of for our party . i just do n't think the cheesecake is that great , i 'm sorry ! but the apps are n't too bad .		3		0
lollicup is a franchise i first experienced back in la . . i come here every now and then , but the odd location is definitely not favorable for business . it 's so quiet ... too quiet at times . i have some boba and zzzzzzz ... i 'm sure this place does well for pickups to stay around . nothing too special about their bobas except the cup says lollicup not some other store name . i 'm used to the boba service - give me my boba without a smile and go about your way - fair enough i guess . decor ... um sure they have chairs and tables . what 's pretty cool about this place is the board games . any one for some connect 4 ? i was champ back in the 4th grade ... oh yeah ... and i was sporting a bowl cut hairstyle too while connecting my fours ; -rrb- - enjoy !		3		0
this place is `` aight '' . it 's not a fancy seafood place , but its not long john silver 's either . i actually found it to be a bit pricey for the type of fare , even though understandably seafood tends to be more expensive . i felt like they were charging more just because they could , but not because they deserved it . i 've had dinner here and a few happy hour events . everytime i leave like i enjoyed the food , but was slightly ripped off . if i were to recommend something : the calamari and fish tacos were good .		3		0
what 's italian for average ? ah ... passabile . not only that but i think the place might have a sort of identity crisis . the place is decorated to be a traditional , upscale spot . but then they play the loud music and hire the cast of jersey shore , complete with the oreganos style t-shirts , to serve . we 've tried several pasta dishes and they were lacking originality and flavor . one bright spot is the olive oil they use . it is very fruity and light . the chicken was decent but , once again , flavor deficient . in a town full of flavor and variety i would be hard pressed to come up with a reason to visit again .		3		0
i tried their pizza a few years ago , and thought it was okay . i like the concept of using some natural and organic ingredients , but the flavor when it 's all pulled together leaves me wanting something a little better . it makes me think : `` this is what pizza in california probably tastes like . '' i agreed to get some pizza from here recently for two reasons . 1 -rrb- they now deliver to my neck of the woods . 2 -rrb- they offer a gluten-free crust for my pizza-deprived husband who recently discovered his sensitivity . i ordered a regular sausage and mushroom for me and a gluten-free cheese and pepperoni for him . i got a mushroom and onion . i could have called and complained , i know , i know , but i did n't . i just picked off the onions . not what i was expecting , but i put the lingering thoughts of yummy sausage in the back of my head and moved forward trying to enjoy my mushroom pizza with the flavor of carmelized onions . it was okay , but the next time we order i will make sure that the guy heard me correctly . the husband thought his was fabulous . but he has n't had pizza in over 3 months . it 's kind of like when he stopped drinking beer because of the wheat , then realized that budweiser is made without wheat , and now he likes bud . or when vegan 's say a desert is good . i 'll probably order from here again , if only to please the hubby .		3		0
this past weekend we were celebrating my birthday with a little staycation up the road at royal palms and since i had read this place had the best steaks in phoenix , i decided to give it a try since i love a good steak on my birthday . admittedly , i 'm a bit of a filet snob since i grew up in the midwest and we have some of the best steaks i 've had anywhere in the world . i drive by this place all the time and its outside apparence looks like a typical , run of the mill steakhouse so i never considered it but when a living social deal was offered , it prompted us to give it a try and i thought maybe the inside had something great to offer . we called several times the day before to try and change our reservation time but only got their answering machine on a sunday . i doubt they were closed so i 'm not sure what was going on with that . we decided the original time worked for us anyway so we made our way there . upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly and welcoming valet . when we stepped inside it was a tiny bit of a let down . it was the standard , dark wood , white table cloth steakhouse that looks just about every other one i 've been to . the reception staff was very friendly and one woman happily agreed to take our picture while the other hostest went to check on our booth . she returned shortly and took us to a booth without any waiting . while i 'm not fond of the u shaped booth that 's always awkward to sit in , no matter how many are in your party , it was pretty comfy and we settled in . our team of servers were nice and prompt with water , bread and telling us about the specials . no one ever asked if we were celebrating anything special so it never came up that it was my birthday . it was nice to see that the potato and vegetables were included in the price of the steaks rather than al a cart . other sides were average priced for a steakhouse at about $ 11-15 i think . i opted for the 8oz filet , medium , with a baked potato and requested that i substitue my vegetables for a side of creamed spinach . unfortunately they could n't accomodate a direct substitution so we ended up paying for a full side of the spinach and also of the mac n cheese with bacon . my fiance ordered the cajun ribeye . the bread and butter were good , but nothing different or extraordinary . when our dinner arrived , it looked really good . instead of loading the potato in the kitchen , the waiter had a server with all the potato toppings and offered as much butter and sour cream as i wanted , nice touch . the sides of spinach and mac n cheese were big portions and looked delicious . my first cut into the steak was perfect and it was perfect throughout . while the tenderness was superb , you could cut it with a fork , and the flavor was good , there was nothing that set this apart from the rest of the other steaks you can get elsewhere like a ruth 's chris or capital grill . zero seasoning so all you got was meat . luckily i went all out on the sour cream for my potato because otherwise , it was very dry . the creamed spinach was really good but i did n't care for the mac n cheese . it seemed a bit dry to me and the bacon bits on it almost tasted like bacon bits from a jar . i would have preferred velvetta shells and cheese to this . my fiances ribeye was also cooked perfectly and the taste i had , it was really good . the staff continued to check on us through out the meal and we opted not to order dessert because we were so full . there was no issue using the living social deal and the meal ended up costing about $ 100 once we used the deal pricing . overall , good service , mediocre steak and average sides . the ambiance was standard steakhouse with little to differentiate itself from anywhere else . our meal was good but i do n't think i 'd ever come back .		3		0
it is difficult writing a review . this restaurant changes in quality , portions and pricing quite frequently . i have to say that i do enjoy the food , but the prices are expensive , too expensive - it is ny style deli ! a sandwich with an ice tea after tip is closing in on $ 20.00 . the staff are hit and miss ; some good , some have these artificially less than genuine ny style bad ass attitudes - too funny ! the corn beef , pastrami and turkey is all good as is the cole slaw . the desserts are simply fantastic . again , a piece of 7 layer cake for $ 5.00 or so is not something i care to remember or repeat . i am probably one of the few that miss the atmosphere of the old location on greenway . the new location is just to artificial and kitsche . the wait in line can be frustrating - the greeters tend to deflate the actual wait times - try it with a three year old . the food is good , but do n't choke when you get the check .		3		0
i like the burger tapas concept thing they have going , but the entire time i was here as i sat on the patio , i laughed at the `` under construction '' sign of delux under plain view smack dab across the street on scottsdale road . so of course during my meal i could n't help but draw comparisons to delux . granted , it probably would have happened anyway , but regardless , i found the constant reminder amusing . my friend maya brought me and some out-of-towner friends who ooed and aahed over the place . `` sliders are so trendy ! '' i exclaimed to the group as we basked in the stench of the scottsdale canal from the patio and watched as sceney passersby and diners enjoyed the saturday afternoon . i immediately felt like hurling , not sure if it was over the stench , the half-joking insipid exclamation i made , or the poseurish crowd - inclusive of a blond scottsdale broad in a baby blue jumpsuit with matching blue flip flops . -lrb- we saw that blue smurf atrocity later at giligin 's , naturally . -rrb- back to stax -- the 3 oz . burgers themselves are good ... not excellent , and not bad either . they offer more variety in burgers than delux : salmon , turkey , ostrich , veggie , etc. . the meat was cooked well done on one and a little too charred on another - the buffalo . the highlights here are the toppings and customizable add this , add that option -lrb- incl . cheese , sauted mushrooms , caramelized onions , tots , sweet potato fries -rrb- which opens up a number of possibilities . i really liked the toppings on the buffalo - muenster cheese , peach bbq sauce , pickled shallots and an onion ring . a friend asked our server how many to order to equal a typical hamburger and her answer was 2.5 , so basically two or three . ahh , there 's the rub . the sliders are $ 4 - $ 5 . ordering three will mean you spend $ 12 - $ 15 . yikes . definitely more expensive than an oft-criticized-as-expensive delux . service here was solid if a bit slow to start . my friends ' margaritas came out very quickly , but the diet coke i ordered took about 10 minutes . i would come here again , if for only the dipping sauces . garlic , aioli , pesto , chipotle . crap , they were all excellent .		3		0
does anyone else think that writing these multiple reviews makes you tougher and tougher to please ? am i being tough or is it that all these restaurants seem so much alike ? i liked this restaurant . the food was good . the waiter , kevin , was great . but , geezuz , i did n't think there was really anything special about it . i guess it will go into my `` count on them for consistency '' file more so than my `` new and different '' file .		3		0
this place was a laugh ! ... in a good way ... we had just ordered when a simulated lighting storm occurred ... the lights were flashing , thunder was booming and all of the animatronics were screeching ... . we just had to try this place as i had never experienced anything like this in australia ... the restaurant came complete with a night sky with twinkling stars , a fog machine around the bar , huge tropical fish tanks and bar stools in the shape of animal rears and feet ! ... our waitress was great ... and the food was good ... we did not expect 5 star dining as clearly this is the last place you would go if you were feeling 5 star ... it is essentially for children but we had fun as we still have a lot of child in us . my husband had the coconut shrimp which was actually very good and i had the english style fish and chips which i have to say was not very english but the fish was very tasty . great for a casual bite and to entertain the children ... . not sure if you want to take very young young children here though as it can get quite noisy and some of the very young ones looked quite concerned !		3		0
sometimes i crave a big , juicy burger . on a recent friday , a few co-workers and i went to five guys to get our dose of beefy goodness . the menu is simple - burgers , hot dogs and fries . one thing that is important to know is that the regular burgers come with two patties , while the ` little ' burgers come with one . convinced -lrb- or perhaps challenged -rrb- by my co-workers to try the full-size , i went with the cheeseburger . from the long list of toppings -lrb- all free -rrb- i chose to go ` all the way ' except for the tomato which meant mayo , mustard , ketchup , lettuce , pickles , grilled onions and mushrooms . the burger was pretty good - juicy and messy . i think i should have skipped the grilled onions , though , as there were far too many of them . the fries come in two sizes -lrb- big and huge -rrb- and two ways - regular and cajun . we shared a large order of cajun fries among the three of us , and i think it would have taken two more people to finish them . the fries were thick-cut , which i really like , but the cajun seasoning made them very salty . all orders are served up in plain brown paper bags , even if you are not taking the food to-go . a cute idea , except that the brown paper really soaks up that french fry grease . i know burgers & fries are greasy . duh . i just do n't want to have such obvious visual confirmation of that . the shiny glistening sheen that had soaked through the brown paper bag was not what i wanted to see after finishing my meal . overall a tasty burger , and so-so fries . would i have the burger again ? sure . however , five guys will not replace in-n-out as my go-to place to satisfy my burger cravings . yes , i will always be a california girl at heart !		3		0
i was supposed to be meeting several people there for a happy hour , but got stood up . it turned out to be ok though . my server patrick was very nice and helped me decide on a delicious sauvignon blanc and some nice cheeses . i also had a bowl of the shrimp corn chowder . overall , i thought the locations was great . nice atmosphere and a great patio . the menu was a little disappointing and i would have enjoyed a bit more help in deciding on cheeses . i said i was a big fan of goat cheese , but when he brought me my trip plate , there was only one goat cheese present . i had the purple haze -lrb- goat -rrb- , barely buzzed -lrb- cow -rrb- , and purple moon -lrb- cow -rrb- . he did n't ask any questions about what i liked in my cheese , was i adventurous , etc. . he brought me things that were popular , so i guess that would be safe assumptions , but as a lone diner available to answer questions and make bigger decisions , i would 've expected a bit more of a unique experience . and the soup was a little thick for me . tasted like it may have been the bottom of that batch . there were a few things on the menu i 'd be interested in trying for entrees -lrb- the small plates/apps were meh -rrb- , and having a few delicious cheeses with wine and friends on their patio would definitely be a fun evening .		3		0
the first time i went here , the tortas were great . on subsequent visits , i was n't as impressed with the quality , and prices went up a bit . coincidentally , they started getting a lot of press for being one of the best sandwich places in the valley . the cynic in me makes it hard not to think that they are coasting a bit on their rep with the gringo crowd . this place is n't consistently fast or consistently good - and on multiple occasions , they 've even been out of key ingredients early in the day . still , the tortas are good , and they are n't so much over-priced as other torta places are under-priced . decent value , decent quality , 3 stars .		3		0
i would like to first say that i 'm not really into mexican . i have a few staple dishes that i like to stick with ... okay , it 's limited to quesadillas and tacos , but a girl knows what she likes . i 've been to verde twice . i 've had their green chili pork and chicken chaquiles . i like the pork , it was a bit spicy for me . that really does n't mean anything because i have no tolerance for spice . all in all , it was good . loved the tortillas with the pork . the chaquiles were okay . i like tortilla chips , so i thought i would like this , but unfortunately i did n't . all in all , verde was only okay for me . i 'll go back because of it 's convenient location and there are plenty of other things on the menu that i would like to try .		3		0
i was really disappointed that sushi eye has such creativity with their rolls but they are all the same in the wasabi sauce and macadamia nuts on them . my biggest complaint is i do n't like wasabi so what am i supposed to eat ? yes i could get them without that sauce on them but then the roll is a bit dry wish i had another sauce option . also i 'm not a fan of macadamia nuts either why put them on every roll ??? it 's just weird to me we are not in hawaii and some people are allergic to nuts . i did however find a roll i liked that was the bay island roll which was a california roll topped w / bay scallops , baked in mild spicy sauce & sprinkled w / scallions & tobiko . it was for sure something i would get again . the other roll i ordered called the sweet thang had fresh water eel , crab , avocado & cream cheese , dressed w / unagi sauce , macadamia nuts & tobiko . no where did it say wasabi but i tasted it instantly and that was a huge let down . so i guess if you love wasabi and macadamia nuts then this is the place for you otherwise there are a lot of other sushi joints in the valley that cater to a bigger variety of pallets .		3		0
do n't quite think it 's bringing sexy back ... what ca n't i say about this place that has n't been said before ? food : they have a new chef , so apparently they heard others talking badly about the food . i actually really enjoyed the food and our server was awesome . ridiculously expensive ? yes . good to my tum ? definitely . we decided to try a little of everything so in our menu was the seared ahi , chopped salad with bacon dates , tenderloin empanadas , mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes , and sweet potato fries . ahi was seared perfectly . it had a slightly spicey musky sauce with it . very yum unless you do n't like raw-ish fish . bacon dates are my new favorite . mmmm . empanadas were good , but you did n't really get much of a meat flavor . caprese was wonderfully fresh . sweet potato fries ... god yes . price per dish around $ 9 to $ 14 . you 're looking at about $ 25 for an entree . drinks were relatively decent in price ... but $ 12 for a glass of wine . my favorite reisling is $ 12 per bottle , for crying out loud . this place is awesome for people watching . young things with massive ... melons of flesh , meat-head men trying to look cool , 50 + women trying to outdo the young things , and 50 + men ogling everyone creepily . the singers on stage were quite cheesy . great choice in music , but i 'd much rather listen to the dj version than a upscale karaoke . no dude , you 're not bringing sexy back with those aviator shades and check shirt . and whoa ... the female singer ... honey , you need someone else to do your extentions . wierd mix of dress code : from prom date to stained t-shirts . ugh . $ 9 for a pack of cigs -lrb- i do n't smoke , but i heard -rrb- and you can order a drink in the bathroom . wha ? so you can drink and pee all night long and never have to leave the room ? funny , funny place . i 'd probably go again mainly for the abundance of people watching . this place does n't get more than three mainly for the cheese factor and the prices . at least sugar daddies abound at this place .		3		0
this place is popular w / the overseas chinese -lrb- and especially -rrb- of the college student variety ... probably cuz the pricing is dirt cheap and gives them a bit of home . it 's a choice for chinese food considering the plethora of vietnamese offerings at the mekong place across the street . service was slow on this full friday night and did see a couple walk out , but the staff is super uber duper friendly -lrb- owner waitress to the young guy waiter -rrb- . hk milk tea -- better than most , i like mine cold . yellow leek bean sprout fish -- almost all sprout over leek , tasty but extremely oily . could of cut that down by half at least , was trying to drain the oil out . spicy pork noodle -lrb- on the wall pic -rrb- -- sweet and not very spicy , you 'd like it if you 're a fan of thick round white noodle dishes . salted fish , chicken & tofu pot -- best of the bunch . preserved salted fish is used sparingly to flavor the remaining ingredients .		3		0
i can walk there !!! not , like , a real city person walk . i mean a `` phoenix , arizona , this is totally walking distance from my office '' kind of situation . so , i am in heaven . that being said , i 'm not sure i can see myself hanging out at lola . it was sort of chilly inside -lrb- both temperature wise and general tone -rrb- . but , i have been enjoying the coffee . the first time i went to lola , i got their version of a white mocha - very very good . today i picked their drip coffee and asked for hazelnut flavoring to be added . i was pleasantly surprised that i was not charged extra for the hazelnut , that i almost tipped the girl ... if only she would have smiled ... or made me feel remotely welcome . so , lola could use some customer service spiffying up -lrb- based on other reviews i read as well -rrb- , but it 's not going to stop me from going there . did i mention i can walk there ? oh , and the coffee today was really quite good .		3		0
wow , the overall review of 3.5 stars is exactly how i would rate the garage . been wanting to check it out for some time , but the lackluster overall rating has kept me away until we finally made our way in on a nice saturday evening . it was pretty busy , lot 's of people eating outside and really liked the fireplace kind of area once entering . big tvs overhead playing sports , so a bit offsetting as one would imagine a bit more creativity what to put on those tvs especially given the obvious thought and money put into making this place look pretty cool . oh you know , perhaps some cool black and white movies or something . if i wanted espn , there 's a sports bar across the street , zipps . nevertheless , seated promptly and waited upon by a friendly and prompt server . ordered the chili wings to start and a side salad , the server asked if we wanted the wings and salad first , and said yes , sounds good . also ordered the garage burger and meat lovers flat bread . the appetizers came out the exact time as the main entree , which kind of disappointed as we ordered the other stuff first . ok no big deal , the wings were just ok and actually a bit on the cold side , as if to say ... hey they were waiting a few to be picked up , frown time . the garage burger was competent but forgettable . seriously nothing to write home about . the waffle fries could have used some spicy seasoning salt or something . and as to the flat bread you may not be asking ?? i sh $ & t you not , it tasted exactly like those frozen tostino 's pizza things i ate as a kid/teenager . seriously had the exact same taste . come on for $ 9 it should taste better no ? disappointed . 2 beers on tap , one margarita . total $ 60 with a $ 10 tip , $ 70 for dinner . that 's cool but i think i could have gotten a slightly better quality dinner for that kind of money . all in all , a competent spot that needs to work on their food and timing . but especially the food could use some more attention to detail . i would go back for sure because its a cool place , but it needs a little help . new chef perhaps or floor manager with keen attention to quality and timing of food . one thing is certain , the $ 9 tostino thing is not acceptable by most standards , especially with so many choices in cen pho to eat at . good place to grab a burger and a beer , but does n't go the extra mile imo .		3		0
dishes sampled include : raspberry lavender wine cooler grapefruit ginger wine cooler corn coins with fennel , herbs , pecorino beets with pears and pecorino polenta with romesco burrata with olive oil , sea salt , crostini margherita with house mozzarella , roasted tomato , basil , olive oil - half artichoke hearts casanova with prosciutto , dates , ricotta , arugula , pecorino bombolini with chocolate dip from the team behind postino featuring crusts crafted by local bread legend mj coe federal pizza seemed like a great choice for lunch after visiting the desert botanical gardens and with the new restaurant clearly fresh on the minds of locals i was not surprised by the proposed thirty minute wait on our arrival ; what i was surprised by , however , was how poorly the restaurant flowed after we were finally seated nearly an hour later on the outdoor patio - even taking into account ` growing pains ' the service needed work , our waiter john forgetting about us -lrb- and part of our order -rrb- leaving us with empty water glasses more than once while sitting in the sun and a nearly forty minute gap between appetizers and pizzas . subpar service aside , once the food began to arrive at federal we were met with a somewhat mixed bag as the appetizers , including the oft raved ` corn coins ' and a bright , bold , and balanced salad of various beets proved far superior to the pies - particularly the doughy , limp , and undercooked margherita . faring better , both in terms of ingredients and texture , i will admit that the casanova was a good pizza with great chew and top quality ingredients , but for two pizzas on the exact same day to be so wildly inconsistent certainly gives me pause when considering a recommendation of federal pizza , let alone a return visit ... not in a city where far better pizza can be found in abundance . a nice space for drinks , appetizers , and even desserts perhaps i 'll give federal pizza a second chance at some point , but with pizzeria bianco , ` pomo , the parlor , and la grande orange all turning out a superior product there is no chance i 'd wait in line to do so .		3		0
my gal and i decided to give mama java 's a try and i realize why i love hava java so much . mama java does have good coffee ! if you want a good cup of joe this could be your place . i guess i have been spoiled by hj 's service . mama java 's seems to have a more sterile and less friendly feel to it . it could have just been the time we went , but i had no desire to stay and drink our coffee . the place was n't as welcoming as our usual hangouts . overall the coffee was worth 4 stars , unfortunately the service and atmosphere brought it down a little for me .		3		0
hmmmm ... i have been there a few times and each time i want to give a completely different rating so i settled for a mid-range 3 stars . totally depends on the night and more specifically , the dj . this is unfortunate because you have to pay a hefty cover either way . * unless you get there before 10 30pm and then you 're good * first time i went ... really awesome and almost beat out char 's has the blues -lrb- which is my ultimate favorite -rrb- so that says a lot . the dj was great and there were lots of people dancing . love the rooftop bar and dance floor , giant chalkboard wall and people there in general . second time ... a letdown . not so great dj so a lot less people , expensive and ridiculously weak drinks , still same $ 10 cover . i would suggest to research the dj and get there before 10:30 pm on the weekend .		3		0
now i like a good salad . and i like it even better when you put a whole bunch of fresh veggie ingredients in front of me and let me select the ones i feel like having today . so on a scale of 1-10 , i would say that sweet tomatoes gets about an eight . why only an eight ? because today i actually looked at my receipt when i pulled it out of my purse and before i threw it away . the salad at sweet tomatoes is not cheap ; nor too expensive ... but , oh my goodness , i nearly had a heart attack when i saw that i paid $ 2.39 for a little dinky glass filled with ice cubes and about 4 oz of tea . yes , i could have returned to the drink dispenser and refilled my glass a half dozen times until i had consumed $ 2.39 worth of tea . but , $ 2.39 ? ... at what is a glorified fast food salad bar ? next time i will be drinking water ... unless they start charging me for that too .		3		0
nice layout , wide berths . well-lit and clean . only complaint was that the women 's restroom reeked of urine . took mom to see a couple of 3d movies here last night -lrb- `` how to train your dragon '' and `` alice in wonderland '' - both are excellent ! very entertaining and great fun to match the actors w / the characters ' voices ! -rrb- how is it that the playback of 3d movies has n't been perfected , yet ? we were going to see `` clash of the titans , '' and after 20 minutes of trying to fix the defect -lrb- we could n't even view the 3d previews -rrb- , management decided to cancel the viewing and gave us all passes - a relief since many in the audience were demanding free hotdogs . free hotdogs ?? c'mon people ! hotdogs cost only $ 5 , if that ! just sit tight , keep cool minds and be patient , and management usually will resolve the situation w / a free pass to see any movie . yes , even 3d movies -lrb- $ 13.75 here at westgate -rrb- . i 've been to az mills harkins 3d imax and the movie did n't start up correctly , either . i also received free movie passes there , too . -lrb- hotdogs ? really ? that 's like using a complimentary drink coupon worth $ 8 to buy a bottle of beer or a glass of house wine that costs less than $ 5 ... -rrb- btw , 3d at amc , at least at westgate , is much better than 3d harkins , but maybe that was bec . i saw such fun films last night and the movie i saw at harkins -lrb- `` avatar 3d '' in dolby 3d -rrb- was such a letdown compared to the 3d imax version i saw at az mills . hmm ... i 'll need more research .		3		0
my wife and i were invited to the pre-grand opening thing here last night . it was pretty much like i expected ; free food , pretty busy , etc. , etc. . the actual location is very nice , very new and very clean so no complaints there . their entire staff from the people running the event to the managers to the cashier were all very fast , friendly and helpful . i did n't really know what to make of this place . is it fast food ? is it a nice , sit-down type of place ? i think it is a small , more `` upscale '' , `` boutiquey '' fudruckers . i 'm not saying that is a bad thing . just saying that is what i thought of the place . anyway , about the food : * smashwedge salad - my wife and i shared this and it was very good . very odd though -lrb- in a good way -rrb- for a fast food place . * classic smashburger - excellent . perfectly juicy and tasty . definitely one of the best fast food burgers i 've tasted . you can see and taste that the ingredients were very fresh . * smashfries and sweet potato smashfries = no bueno !!! i was really looking forward to eating these , but i did n't think they were very good at all . i just do not enjoy rosemary on my fries . french fries should n't taste like soap or something . i do n't know - maybe i 'm just not fancy enough to like random herbs on my fries . at the very least they could have went farther down fancy lane and provided some aioli which would have been nice . next time i 'm going to hold the flowers and order regular fries for sure . i know i was n't paying but i feel this place is overpriced . an average of $ 6 - $ 7 for a burger or chicken sandwich seems a bit high . by the time you add fries and a drink you are over $ 10 which is way high for a fast food place . i really wanted to try the veggie frites but they were out so maybe next time i 'll give them a whirl . i may give the fried pickles a shot as well because i am very curious as i had never tried one before . anyway , my first smashburger experience was a pleasant one and i would like to return to get another burger , try their regular fries , get some veggie frites and maybe a fried pickle .		3		0
trendy trendy trendy . in other words : a freakishly long wait to sit down , much too loud music , shitty parking -lrb- i had my car towed out of a lot there once so beware , they show no mercy -rrb- , stiff but pricey drinks , and packed with everyone you saw last friday at six . i dont mind this kind of nonsense so i dont mind stingray . their rolls , to me , are compareable to ra 's . a little weak , skinny and a bit overrated , but again , it seems to work for them . outdoor seating in the winter is a great place to be since it overlooks scottsdale road -- instant entertainment . go to stingray more for the overall `` scottsdale '' experience than for the food , or mediocre service .		3		0
let me start by saying this location has been here for over 20 years now . i remember when they built it . i honestly never thought it would last this long . but , here it is still going strong . i have not been over to this location in a very long time . still looks the same only more techi now than ever . when i used to come here they would have tv 's , music machines , dvd player , etc now , every thing is high tech . from the phones to the televisions . they have good appliances here and have a good stock . they deliver when they say they will which is why i go back to them all the time . i do not like the up sale they are always trying to do . always trying to get you to buy a warrenty service.i think it should just come with it . though the folks that work here are quite in the know about all the latest and how to use them . so i do appreciate that for sure . lots of parking in the lot , though it is always really full -lrb- the lot -rrb- . they do charge for delivery . but , not a bad store by far .		3		0
when your the only person in a large dining room , you should be able to get a water refill , but not here . well buddy , you earned your 64 cents tip on my meal . sign up for the email club , get a free appetizer . the lunch costs $ 7.99 with basic pasta , soup or salad . the minestrone was horrid and from a can , but the large rigatoni with rosa sauce was quite good . also good was free bread and my free app choice of cheesy florentine bread . manager was eating lunch at 1pm and restaurant was a ghost town for some reason - maybe because you get no respect if your a solo diner . with another coupon would try different location .		3		0
i heard about aloha kitchen from yelp . apparently , they 've been at this same location for around 24 years , wow ! the service was good . the person who took my order helped me pick my entree since it was my first time there . i had the bulkogi and chicken katsu combination for $ 7.95 . i was n't overwhelmed by the quality of the food , but the flavor was nice and it was a good change of pace from the same old deli experience . it was more than enough food for me , so i guess the price was right for the value . aloha kitchen is n't going to become my new regular spot , but i 'd go again .		3		0
oh i hate to do this , -lrb- food and drink quality is still good -rrb- . 32 has been my favorite spot for awhile now for coffee . now where do i start on my new review ... i struggled between 2 or 3 stars , but i am being biased and letting them live with the 3 instead . i have n't been to 32 in 2 weeks , and decided to stop by and get some drinks with my wife . when we get there it is all new people working there , that is a little depressing . i will reminisce that the first baristas i met here have been hands down my favorite and none have filled the shoes they left . back to my experience . . i have my loyalty card with one punch left . that means my wife and i only need to pay for one of our drinks ! yay ! sounds like my day is going pretty well . the next event was waiting for this girl who was just tinkering on the ipad to get done and greet us and get our orders . we order or drinks , and she says `` i ca n't give you your free drink . '' i was just honestly confused and stunned so i did n't say anything . girl - `` you are doing this in one purchase right ? me - `` yes ... '' at this point in my head i am thinking ... what !?!? it has never been like that . . for the 3 or so years i have been coming here it has never been like that ... girl - `` well you can do it in two transactions '' me - `` yeah do that . '' ... at this point to prevent me from being over involved in this conversation i flip open my phone and wait for her to figure this all out the girl turns to the person working on the bar and asks some question about the situation . yay it 's the manager working at the bar , finally a familiar face . she was as confused as i was about the situation . girl - `` well i do n't want to give them a double discount , a punch in the card and a free drink '' at this point i just space out because this is the most ridiculousness i have heard . no where does that , or acts like that ... let alone in front of a customer . granted i did not say anything else and just got my drink and left . wow ... i just do n't even want to express how sad this is for me that 32 is starting to be one of `` those '' places		3		0
oh , ikea . i have such a love hate relationship with you . ikea is crazy , tiring , and crowded . i always say that i hope i do n't have to go back when i leave , and usually need some sort of de-stressing after . as many of us know , a lot of the items at ikea are cheap in price and quality . but , ikea really is perfect for all types of people . i think everyone can find their niche at ikea . i 've already noted what i do n't like , so here are the things that keep me coming back to ikea : - select pieces of furniture . i have desks , bookshelves , and a dresser from ikea . they are cute and i like them . but , i like to mix them in with quality pieces . - organization . great cheap accessories to keep things organized . - plants . i have a bunch of great cacti and pots from ikea .		3		0
walk in , seat yourself . beer prices incredibly high , it is indeed $ 8 for a guinness . they offer pbr . pbr , at an upscale restaurant , for $ 4 . this is a fairly significant fail , simply given the fact that i 've never seen such swill -lrb- at those prices ! -rrb- offered at a place like this . there was stella and hoegaarden offered as well , but at $ 7 , who wants that ? we should have immediately abandoned all hope of ordering beer and turned to the fairly impressive-looking wine selection , but no one in my party was inclined to do so . so that was the first disappointment . miller high life and other domestics do not merit $ 5 . i honestly wondered whether this was an intentional choice , aimed at adding a touch of irony to the menu , but finally must simply conclude that they 're attempting to drive people to the wine list . the burger options : there are three pre-designed burgers , none of which quite seemed to call out to me , and one yellowfin tuna sandwich counted among the burgers . i elected to build my own . 13 different cheeses are named and a brief description is provided , along with the source . refer to the menu if you 're confused . i thought this was an excellent touch . there are extras -lrb- ie , bacon , toasted tomatoes , etc -rrb- and sauces -lrb- ranch , garlic aoli , bbq , so on -rrb- that can also be added . i opted for a simple combination of midnight moon cheese and jalapeno bacon . i did n't say it was a good combination , i said it was relatively simple . they offer a side of 1000 island dressing with any burger , along with basic lettuce , tomatoes , pickles , and onion according to your preferences . i ordered mine rare . our table of 4 also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries , -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- which were good . the burgers emerged not long thereafter . mine was medium or medium well , only a little pink towards the side . this was the other disappointment of the evening . unevenly cooked , and cooked far beyond my order , i was more than a little let down given that their name -lrb- supposedly -rrb- refers to the specific temperature difference between a medium rare and a well done burger . thankfully , the burger was still juicy enough that i was n't forced to apply loads of ketchup or resort to the dressing . the cheese was excellent , mild , and the jalapeno bacon was quite tasty as well . the bun used is a very fluffy white bread , which combines with the thick patty to make the whole package rather intimidating when it 's first brought out . i did thoroughly enjoy the burger , despite the goof-up with the cooking . i did n't check to see how my companions ' burgers were cooked , but they claimed to enjoy theirs as well . another note : we asked our waitress about the beef used and she did not answer with confidence , informing us that the beef was 100 % ground sirloin , 100 % grain-fed beef . i kind of assumed a burger place like this would consider the beef a selling point , but she hemmed and hawed a bit , seeming only too glad to move on with the conversation as soon as her questioner 's curiosity abated . she did n't have to prove anything about the beef to any of us -lrb- i do n't think we were expecting really low-quality meat -rrb- , but she could have been a slightly more enthusiastic salesperson , in my opinion . it looked like lack of training . the decor is eclectic but very upscale on the inside , the patio , where we sat , was pretty plain . the service was really good - other than the brief description of the beef ; i have no other complaints for our servers . there 's nothing wrong with this place , in fact despite my little disappointments , we all enjoyed our meals very much . a few fairly small adjustments , and i 'd easily award this place 5 stars . but this beer selection , in this day and age where beer drinking is no longer vilified even among higher-end restaurants , is an absolute joke . many diners will be even more incensed at the failure to prepare the burger correctly - i felt that the juiciness of the burger at least partially redeemed this error . perhaps those that prefer their burgers medium to medium well will be less dissatisfied . i 'll almost certainly be back , and i 'd be glad to see these issues resolved on future visits . this place is too nice to not have substance to match the flash .		3		0
this place was good , but not great . and expensive , too , for my taste . but , i went there with a group for lunch and was n't sure what to expect . the pizzas are not pies at all , but rather small and on a thin crispy crust . from azcentral : `` the 10 pizzas -lrb- $ 10 - $ 12 -rrb- are personal size , about 10 inches . they range from the simple margherita -lrb- tomato , fresh mozzarella , basil -rrb- and pepperoni to more fanciful pies topped with wild mushrooms , pancetta , red onion and mozzarella or prosciutto , pears , arugula and gorgonzola . '' again , it was good , but not great . i would imagine that one of these pizzas and a good glass of wine , which they have a large selection of , would make for a nice evening of food , wine and conversation .		3		0
a great little independent record store . anything that is not a chain i can stand behind . they have a decent selection , especially the college/indie stuff . not a lot in the way of hip-hop or rap or other genres and imports . they carry both new and used as well as dvds and videos . the staff is friendly and knowledgeable . i do have a hard time finding things i am looking for there sometimes , but more often than not they have what i seek .		3		0
had a lunch date here ... i had the grilled swordfish tacos and i forgot what he had ... i think the grilled ahi tuna . portions were on the smaller size for the price -lrb- yes even for lunch -rrb- . i kind of felt bad , because i picked the place and he paid ... and i just felt it was waaaay to expensive for a lunch . we did have cocktails so our bill was definitely more than $ 60 . we did enjoy the patio ... even in january when the weather is perfect here ! not so sure i 'd do lunch again for the price !!!		3		0
the happy hour isnt too bad and neither is the sushi but i have had better elsewhere ! very busy on weekend nights , interesting just to relax and people watch !! although last time i was here , ended up going over to hava java and gelato spot had a better time there . not really the best place for a large group since twice had issues with service when we had 15 people both times . had made reservations as well and still messed up our checks and forgot my friend ` s sashimi !		3		0
their lunch are definitely cheap but you pretty much get what you pay for . the place is actually run by korean people not japanese . the food is okay but not what i was expecting given the reviews on yelp . we had the albacore with onions , spicy yellow sushi , spicy tuna sushi , tempura , and katsu . the only things that tasted decent were the spicy yellow tail sushi , tempura , and katsu . i guess 3/5 is n't that bad . but i probably would n't get anything raw from them again in the summer . the fish just did not taste fresh and left a gross aftertaste in your mouth afterwards . it was definitely disappointing and did not fulfill my sushi crave . i would actually only give them a 2.5 / 5 but i decided to round up .		3		0
: / loved good fellas the first time we went , as you can tell by my glowing review . but we had quite a few hiccups last time we were there . let 's start with the ordering . and a disclaimer . ninos was no where to be seen - which may have something to do with our experience . it took about 5 minutes for the man behind the counter to do whatever he was doing with the cash register before he could take our order . i ordered the vegetarian plate but they said they were out of the boorak . i said that 's fine but could i please substitute falafel for the boorak on the plate . they said that 's okay ... we tried to pay with our credit card but they could n't seem to work the machine . which is the same thing that happened with the last customer . i had a groupon to redeem on my phone . he clicked the redeem button on my groupon before he got the voucher number . -lrb- facepalm -rrb- luckily he still took the groupon value off our order . we get our drinks , and sit down to the bowls of steaming house soup . -lrb- still delicious ! -rrb- i take a sip of my iced green tea . it tastes like yucky water . i go dump it out and get black tea from their iced tea machine . also looks and tastes like water . i should have told them , but i was exhausted and weak with hunger . so i get sprite and return to our table . our food comes . i am handed a big plate of falafel . -lrb- big sigh -rrb- i wave them down and remind them i ordered the vegetarian plate substituting the boorak for falafel . after much confusion and discussion between the two men running the place , he says he will bring me the rest of the vegetarian plate and we can keep the big plate of falafel . redeemed . then my vegetarian plate comes out . just baba ghanoush and hummus . i give him a blank stare . he says `` this is the vegetarian plate '' with a big smile . i seem to recall the vegetarian plate also had a potato cake which i adored and also was looking forward to . but i was tired , so tired of the back and forth . so i ate the food , which was still delicious and plentiful . my husband loved this gyro sandwich as well . bottom line - the food is still incredible but i am very disappointed with the service that particular night . i hope it does n't happen again or we wo n't return . i am exhausted just from writing this review ...		3		0
hmmm ... i just realized that i may have to cut back on starting my reviews with ` ok , so let me start by saying ... ' ... that being said ... ok , so let me start by saying that this review is slightly tainted ... * tee hee hee * i have been feeling under the weather for a little over a week , so after i wandered listlessly into work on tuesday my friend suggested we go to sweet tomatoes for lunch so i could get some soup . sounded like a good plan to me . so we go through the salad bar then up to the register to pay -lrb- weird set-up , why not pay first or pay last ? why pay in the middle ? i do n't get it . why are you trying to confuse the sicky girl ? it 's just mean ! -rrb- my lunch was about $ 12 -lrb- did i just get charged like $ 4 for a drink ? i dunno , maybe i missed something -rrb- . that 's a little high for just going to get some soup and a beverage , but we were already there , so i decided to go for it because she said they were serving albondigas soup which pretty much always throws me into a good mood . then we were able to venture into the section of warm food . i search and search and search ... no albondigas ! : -lrb- sad tyger . * sigh * shame on your website . anywho , so i got a broth soup with a bunch of veggies ... -lrb- i ca n't tell if it was good or not , my tastebuds died sometime on monday -rrb- but it was hot-ish so its purpose was served . the food looked tasty , the salads looked pretty and green -lrb- except when they were n't supposed to be green ie . macaroni salad , potato salad , etc. -rrb- so i will probably give this place another chance after my taste buds recover from being fever-burnt .		3		0
i have to lead off this review by saying the last mlb game i attended was at fenway . if you 've been , you know what i 'm talkin ' about . that being said , it 's hard not to like chase field . so i 'm in between . i do n't like it but i do n't not like it . it 's ok . none of the seats are bad and the place is a palace . opulent . so much so that it feels wrong to old school baseball fans like me . when you come across the bridge from the chase field parking garage and enter the stadium it feels like you 've entered an office building . huh ? maybe that 's why chase field lacks the tension and energy of many other ballparks . what tone do you want to set for your fans ? that this place rocks and oozes history ? sorry , fenway has that locked-up . that we just had the carpet cleaned and check out my new big screen tv but keep it down , my grandad is sleeping upstairs ? that 's closer to the feeling at chase field . and no offense phoenix fans , maybe it 's a west coast thing . they could not keep a wave going and every cheer the announcer or the ring of bazillion dot boards tried to get going self-extinguished in 10 seconds or less . sad .		3		0
- spa review only - my husband and i decided to celebrate the first day of 2014 with massages and a day at the spa at the camelback inn . i 've heard wonderful things about the resort and spa in particular , so i felt this would be a great way to kick off the new year . the spa is tucked away at the back of the resort , so once we found it we were checked in a directed towards are respective locker rooms . the women 's locker room is a decent size , maybe a little outdated , but overall quite nice . my locker was tricky to get into , but had enough space . the robe i was given had stains on it , which was n't the greatest impression , and the sandals i found to be a bit uncomfortable -lrb- as did the hubs -rrb- . once i changed , i lounged in the waiting area , which was packed before i was called back for my massage . there were so many women being called back for services , it was n't quite relaxing , but oh well . my massage was ok ... nothing really to remember , but it was relaxing -lrb- i 'll take it -rrb- . after our massages , the hubs and i met up and had lunch by the pool . i love the views and it was nice and quiet outside . the waitresses were very nice and prompt . the weather was beautiful ... i mean honestly , does it get better than sitting by the pool on january 1st ??? the banana smoothie we ordered was delicious as were the sliders , really tasty and cooked perfectly . the beet salad was bland and the beets were a bit too hard . after several hours reading by the pool and hitting the hot tub , the hubs and i adjourned to our locker rooms to shower and use the facilities . all in all , i found the spa to be nice , but lacking something . everyone was very friendly and helpful , but there is something i enjoy about a more intimate atmosphere , like the spa at royal palms . despite some minor things , we had a great day enjoying the beauty at this spa and celebrating a new year .		3		0
the appetizers were very good . i enjoyed the much raved about `` griddled corn cakes '' the queso was also unique and delicious . the butter lettuce wedge salad was so delicious . they even chopped it for me to make it easier to eat . the pork tenderloin was so tender and moist . i `` m not a huge fan of this dish in general , but they made me a fan . they keep things interesting by having specials daily . the servers seemed very novice . they did not remember drink orders , i found it unusual they would walk away then come right back and ask again what we said . went on a monday night at 730pm . it was definitely still active at that time . i imagine weekends must be crazy . the food and atmosphere was excellent , i was a little disappointed in the service . otherwise would have given 4 stars .		3		0
my husband and i were at the tempe arts festival around lunch time , and i spotted la bocca . i had it mentally bookmarked for quite a long time , so i was excited to finally try it . i was somewhat disappointed . while i appreciate the pretty people that work there , those pretty people might want to carry a pretty pen and write down an order . we had the bruschetta , which comes with 4 selections , a pizza , and two drinks . so that 's kind of a lot to remember . when i asked our server if he was going to remember all that , he smirked as if to say `` i am a professional lady . '' our bruschetta came and was average overall . the roasted garlic was anything but roasted . it was sliced and did not even remotely have the sweet , caramelized flavor you expect . it was cooked enough to not knock you over , but still retained the firmness of raw garlic . since the bruschetta took quite awhile , i was not concerned that our pizza order was taking even longer . however , our server came by and asked if we needed anything else and i asked about the pizza . deer in the headlights stare . no real apology , just a head shake that told the whole story . his aversion to ink now resulted in another 20 minutes or so to get the pizza . i will say the `` sicily '' pizza was really good with schreiner 's sausage , parmesan and goat cheese , and sundried tomatoes . nice bit of char on the crust . if in the area , i would come back for that . only i will write down the order myself .		3		0
there were some pro 's about this place : service was decent and some of the food was really good . however , other food was just meh . the items that were good : salsa had lots of onions in it which made me happy -lrb- i am a big onion lover ! -rrb- and had a really good fresh flavor , the chips were nice and crisp , the jalapeno cream sauce that came with my numero ocho -lrb- 8 -rrb- combo was delicious with just the right amount of spice , and the fideo that the hubby ordered was different but i really enjoyed it -lrb- hubby said it was too plain for him -rrb- . now onto the other food : hubby said his pork chimichanga was n't bad and that the pork was cooked well but needed more seasoning , my chili relleno was ok but the batter had a weird texture to it , and my spinach enchilada was not very good at all . i like to have other components inside the enchilada rather then just plain spinach and unfortunately , these just had lumps of unflavored spinach with nothing else . so all in all , i would say this place was ok . there were some items that are good enough for me to come back but i would just try something else on the next visit .		3		0
so normally i like this place and the corned beef and cabbage have been quite good ... but , on this occasion , the chef was clearly not irish or familar with irish food & culture , because the dish was dreadful . how to you ruin corened beef a. . . nd cabbage ?? the urge to tell them how to make it was a compelling one . i 'll go back because it 's been decent in the past , and the beer flows freely and good , usually with good company , but , i 'm thinking it 's a one more chance kind of thing . sadly , there are few places in phoenix that claim to be ` irish ' that serve authentic quality irish food . i think if your going to cook food of another culture , you should at least learn how it 's properly prepared and served .		3		0
it 's been a while since we 've been here and we got here by ways of infiniti . we were getting the oil changed on my husband 's car -lrb- or something else equally mundane -rrb- and a salesman kept trying to get us to test drive a new car but we had no interest . he finally sweetened the deal with a ruth 's chris gift card . long story short , we drove the car , got the gift card , got our car back and went to dinner . we got there and sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple of glasses of champagne and scotch before we moved to our seats . i 've got to say , this is the only location i 've been so i ca n't speak for the ambiance of others , but this one is sorely lacking . the lighting is bright , it feels overly open and the air conditioner was blowing full force . we started with the wedge with blue cheese . it was as expected . iceberg with bacon and blue cheese . hard to screw up . tastes good . i do n't remember was cut if steak we ordered but i was talked into getting the butter on my plate . huge mistake . it just made it overly rich . i also ca n't say i 'm a fan of the searing hot plate . it made my medium rare steak progressively more cooked . if it has to go in either direction , i prefer it to be rarer . my husband wanted the au gratin potatoes so we shared an order of those . here 's another one of my beef 's . sometimes restaurants equate richness -lrb- butter and cream -rrb- with flavor and goodness , which they are , but they stop there . they load up the potatoes au gratin with sticks of butter and pints and heavy whipping cream and think , `` viola ! i have created a masterpiece ! '' but in reality they 're just rich and really do n't have much flavor . you can probably tell i did n't think much of them . for desert we ended up with the chocolate sin cake and the creme brulee . both were ok but so are the frozen deserts from trader joe 's . i 'd say they were on par with those . ok when i 'm paying $ 4.99 for two and preparing them myself . not so much when buying one in a restaurant . nothing was bad at ruth 's chris , i was disappointed to find that nothing stood out as phenomenal . next time i 'll stay home and make some steaks myself , we 'll eat them in our pajamas with a bottle of wine them watch some mad men . now that 's a good evening .		3		0
this nice mid-sized place has patio dining available during the cooler months , and a full bar . it 's comfortable inside , & the food is ok , but to me there was nothing exciting about the place . the chicken tikka masala was delicious , but the lentil soup & yogurt salad dressing were not as good as at indian delhi palace , & i had more fun at delhi palace cuisine of india . with the price a little high at $ 9.99 for lunch , & both of these alternatives nearby , i can only give royal taj 3-stars .		3		0
it was a burger kind of night , and we searched high and low on yelp for `` best burger '' and found this place . based on reviews , we decided to give it a shot . it was a bit of a gamble considering we drove in from scottsdale , but it was pretty good . the vibe is pretty hip and swanky inside , with lighted up tables in the center row , but we opted to sit outside in the misted patio . our server took our order for beer . here is where things kind of went a bit south . this place has a pretty extensive craft beer selection , with a strong selection of seasonal beers . our server had no idea what seasonals were on tap , and had no idea how to describe them once he figured out the list . my tip ? print out a list of seasonal beers and put them on the table . on the plus side , they offer beer flights for all of their beers , so you can mix and match everything . awesome sauce . we shared a turkey burger and the chinese chopped chicken salad . both were good . the turkey burger was moist and flavorful . perhaps had a bit too much garlic . the salad was very good , and the portions were very good . overall , this was a decent place . i 'd maybe give it another shot . there was n't any huge red flags that said , `` dave ... do n't come back . '' but , there was n't anything that said , `` omfg , dave ... you have to come back next week and bring all of your friends . '' final grade . 3 stars . solid b.		3		0
hey , a restaurant that sells food and brews their own beer . what a novel concept ! not . bj 's is a chain and they do pretty good by their patrons . i can never go to a restaurant that serves fish and chips and not order it , so that 's all i 've ever had at bj 's . it pales in comparison to places that fry fresh fish , but it 's passable . the beers are decent . then again , so is newcastle and blue moon and bud that you can get on tap anywhere . the real opportunity for bj 's is to put together interesting pairings and make it a real brewhouse . they do have pairings suggested in their menu , but most of them fall flat . a blonde ale with fish and chips ? no , sir . i do n't care that you breaded the fish with the same ale . do you think your average brit would be caught dead drinking `` blonde ale '' , with or without fish and chips ? hells no . stouts and porters , man . it would be better if the waitstaff were a bit hip to the beers and could speak about them intelligently . as it is , they can regurgitate what 's already written in the menu and that 's about it . most of them clearly have not even tried all the beers served there . that should be day 1 of new hire training at bj 's . get sloshed and take a cab home . they need a sommelier , except for beer . does that exist ?		3		0
i was underwhelmed by wandering horse buffet . we went here this morning for sunday brunch . for $ 30 + tip and three cocktails the sunday brunch is a decent value . it was the food that i did n't care for . i have a hearty appetite so i tried just about everything . the best part of my meal was the chicken ceasar salad . the deserts were also relatively tasty . everything in between failed to live up to my expectations . i felt like i was eating at a high end cafeteria as opposed to a fine dining buffet . other reviewers have raved about the seafood selections , but simply having seafood available does not mean a buffet should be esteemed . for example , you can buy a fish sandwich at mcdonalds and crab legs at walmart . the seafood i had today was ordinary at best . i had a california roll that was mostly rice . i had the caprese salad and the mozzarella was so stringy that i would describe it as borderline runny -lrb- i do appreciate the tomatoes being local and heirloom -rrb- . i had three different kinds of chinese food , none of which tasted very good . i had some prosciutto from the cured meats area and discovered a thin sliver of bone or gristle in one of my bites . the english muffin at the base of my eggs benedict was as hard as a rock . i was trying so hard to cut through it with my knife that i almost knocked over my champagne glass . on a more positive note , the views from the patio are phenomenal and the service is very good .		3		0
i forgot about this place for a long time because i was buying my quick asian food elsewhere but elsewhere closed and after paying for a sit down dinner at a asian restaurant plus tip recently - i decided it was time to return to chino . i ordered the pork fried rice and egg fu yung bowl . old school chinese with vegies . my biggest complaint about fast asian food and buffets are that they are all about bland meat with very little vegies but chino did not disappoint me and they were super fast . i will be returning to work my way through the menu .		3		0
2/3 stars the service was very good my wife had the eggs bene which she really like it came w / a side of fruit ... . . no potatoes she also asked for eggs poached soft the wait gal said thats the way they always come ... . not i had the corn beef hash some yelper said it was great ... hey my friend its out of a can . . it was ok came with 3 eggs and a bisquit w chorizo gravy suprising enough it was bland . great eclectic crowd including 3 of phx 's finest ... all set in a 50 's diner setting . zzzzzzzzzzzzz sorry joes probley wont be back ...		3		0
thought saturday night would be busy at 6:00 pm , but to our surprise it was just getting started . we do n't like to go there too often because it seems that a lot of older folks go there , not that i 'm a `` spring chicken '' . the waiter was efficient , he never told us his name but memorized our order . he made sure we had our drink glasses filled at all times . when he brought out the bread , it was only three pieces of different types : roll , carrot bread and another type . we had to ask for another order . my daughter had the chicken pot pie which had chunks of chicken but the sad part , the crust was only on the top , which was golden brown . to her it was okay . my wife had the petite sirloin steak which came with a salad and asparagus . she ordered it medium rare and it was a little too pink , but still eatable . my order was the lamb shank on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus . love asparagus !! the lamb was okay and portion was just right . the sauce that was poured over the lamb was like beef stew gravy with carrots and celery . the sauce was a bit salty for me but bearable . if you looked at the lamb shank you would mistaken it for a turkey drumstick .		3		0
poor zoe 's . they get a bad rap for being bland , but you have to give them credit for having fountain diet dr. pepper and amazing chocolate cake . that said , it 's true : zoe 's does n't have much to offer in the way of flavor . the sides are generally flavorless and dry . the sandwiches make you feel guilty because you could have made them so easily at home , and for much cheaper . but i just ca n't hate on zoe 's that hard . the staff at this location are super laidback , and i 'm a sucker for cashiers who remember me after one visit . i am also a huge fan of big , clean , open spaces with minimal design . it could very well be that i like this place because it 's quick and conveniently located near my place of employment , so do n't group me with the philistinic masses who will eat anything just because the outside is pretty . i think it may be the diet dr. pepper that keeps me coming back .		3		0
went to lunch at the wild thaiger yesterday after having no luck ordering to-go a couple weeks ago . we sat outside on the covered patio , which was pretty busy . our server was prompt and pleasant . the food : i ordered chicken with peanut sauce and jasmine rice . the sauce was very flavorful , but no heat at all . i 'm used to peanut sauce with just a bit of heat and was mildly disappointed with this dish . my friend ordered the pad thai and it was good , but again not much heat . now our server did not ask us about stars or heat at all . if i were to go back i would order the pad thai with a side of peanut sauce and add more heat . all in all , an affordable lunch , good service , and decent thai food . i would like to go back in the evening to check out the inside as i never set foot in it . maybe try another dish too . phoenix yelpers - any other awesome thai places to try ??		3		0
the grapevine is one of those places that you always randomly walk by and think `` i 've got to try this place out , '' but because of it 's obscure , off-the-beaten-path location it 's easy to forget . i think one of the best parts about the grapevine is the diverse realm of fun you can have . whether it 's some day-drinking up on the patio for spring training , some racious karaoke with a distinctly more ... experienced ... crowd , or grabbing some pizza in a dimly lit dining area , the grapevine is definitely not a bad place to stop . it 's been a while since i 've had the food here , but from what i remember it was pretty tastey and equally reasonable in terms of price . drinks are a little on the expensive side , but hey - that 's old town !		3		0
this one is a hard one to rate , so i 'm going to do it the good-old fashion category break down so the numbers do n't lie : 1 - service - service was prompt when we arrived , but it also was a pretty-dead monday evening ; our server guy was friendly and knowledgeable and agreed with us that the red wine should not be served at any colder than 50-60f range ; when the bills came , it was a huge mess and for the order screw-up mid-meal , i think the imposed 20 % gratuity should not have been valid . 2 - cleanliness - place is modern , new and appears to be clean , though it was dark inside and we could n't exactly see too many details . 3 - food quality - i had sashimi and the other gals had rolls ; i 've also experienced some rolls in previous visits that were ok ; i guess i would n't say that their sushi blows me away or is something i 've ever craved . . and i do love sushi but have yet to find a good equivalents to my experiences many years ago at shimogamo and at hiro sushi in n. phx . 4 - pricing - pricey sashimi , but then again , sashimi should n't be discounted if it 's high-quality . . not implying that because i paid $ 25 for 15pc that it is high quality ; their wine glasses are affordable and their rolls are , too . 5 - i am saving this star for the experience - the experience ? meh . i 've had way better and i 've had way worse . i was mostly turned off by the screwing up of one of the gal 's order which was really simple and the fact that there was no apology or price fix , etc. . basically she ate after we all ate because they screwed her order up . also , i was n't thrilled with drinking a cold ass glass of red . . yeah , i 'm in arizona and it 's summer and it 's appropriate to drink cold whites , but not ice cold reds !		3		0
great concept , cool location , okay food . i got the veggie sandwich -lrb- that i loved !!! -rrb- , but tried my friends ' sandwiches -lrb- sloppy joe , chicken sandwich , and a ham/turkey sandwich -rrb- that all left a little something to be desired . do n't get me wrong , it 's not bad , it just does n't knock your socks off . i 'd go here again to try their breakfast and coffee bar . their cinnamon rolls were calling my name from the case too ...		3		0
i live really close to bookman 's , actually within walking distance from my apartment . it 's not a half bad place , and carries an enormous amount of books . i shop here from time to time , and its not a half bad place . they carry cd 's movies , musical instruments and an assortment of other items as well . overall , the store is a good place to shop , but i 'm not the biggest fan of this place . yes , it 's local business , and that 's why i shop here from time to time , but i do n't consider it my `` home '' bookstore for a variety of reasons . please read below for the good , bad and ugly about this place . the good : * wide selection of items new and used . books , cd 's , movies , instruments and much much more . it 's definitely local business and i feel better buying from here then other big box stores . you can get a huge selection of new or used items at fair prices . the bad : * store feels tired and old . not that it 's going to turn me away , but has a darker feel to it them most . also , i feel like the selection is more fiction based then non fiction . * i do n't think they give you a store credit for trades , just cash . i like to put my money towards re shopping at the same place , but i do n't think they do that here . i could be wrong , but that 's my knowledge . the ugly : * they have a security guard here at all times . wait , its an actually police officer . i do n't know why , but it 's kind of intimidating to walk in and cruise past a cop . i 've been to other bookstores and they do n't seem to have this problem , so i 'm not sure what that 's all about . are gang bangers suddenly cruising through a bookstore and having turf wars ? is there a serious stealing problem here ? what gives ? to much riff raff ? * also , even though the staff is helpful , there 's a sense of arrogance depending on who helps you . are they all this way ? no , just some . i feel like i 'm at a snobby coffee bar when i shop here . it 's the trendy mentality that gets me at times . look , i like to support these places , but it gets old when i really need help finding a book or have questions about something and i feel like i should already know the answers to my own questions . it does n't happen often , but there is a vibe at times that i ca n't shake . * one time i came here and there was some sort of star wars convention going on . even though i 'm not a star trek fan , it was fun to watch adults and kids having a good time . good to see that their doing events like this . overall , i ca n't hate on the bookstore , and i say if you live close , shop here . it 's just not on my short list of places i absolutely love , that 's all . huge selection , great prices with wall to wall everything .		3		0
went here tonight based on reviews from yelp . we ordered food to go . they cook everything except the salads in some spice rub so beware if you do not like spicy food , which we do not . the grill cheese sandwich with bacon is very spicy due to the rub on the bacon , it is also very expensive @ $ 13.00 and not at all worth it - 3 different kinds of cheese , 1 piece of bacon on sourdough bread . nothing special and way over price along with the mac & cheese a itsy bitsy tiny bowl for $ 5.00 ... the kale salad and the cobb salad nothing special once again just ok . the cole slaw which came with the brisket , again nothing special just ok ... the cobbler is very very sweet , overly sweet and the chocolate cake while okay it is a bit expensive @ $ 6.00 for what you get or rather do not get . i had the beef brisket , the rub again was spicy so what i could eat was very good , it was tender and melted in my mouth . i would not recommend taking food out , but rather eating it to experience the big screen tv , the bar and the high booths ... my family was not impressed with the place , but i like dives so i will try again if just for the brisket .		3		0
i have only been here a couple of times for lunch and have n't tried much on their menu but my experiences so far have been ok . nothing was bad but nothing was really memorable either . it 's a little place that feels like a converted wendy 's or other fast food restaurant without much character . on both occasions , we stuck to the ` lunch specials ' but i think i 'd be happier ordering from the regular menu . sabai serves standard traditional thai/fusion fare with typical offerings of stir-fry , curries , and the like .		3		0
i 'll start off by saying that saddle ranch chop house is one of the few places open on sunday around 3pm ... that 's how we ended up eating a late lunch / early dinner there . i called arcadia farms , orange table , sugarbakers , and bandera with no such luck ... so , saddle ranch came to the rescue in that sense . i was with 2 girlfriends and we all decided that it was probably ` first a bar , then a restaurant ' based on the food we had . 2 of us shared a cobb salad and a veggie burger , and the other had one of the chicken wraps . cobb salad - eh ... -lrb- maybe it would 've been better with tomato but because of the recent scare , no tomato for us ! -rrb- veggie burger - not so much - pretty bad but we dressed it up with avocado , lettuce , ketchup , and mustard . we did have the sweet potato casserole as a side and that was delicious - on the sweet side though so be warned ! i did notice a decent size breakfast menu and of course the bull that was resting during the time we were there ... he probably had a rough night the night before ! service was just ok ... waitresses -lrb- and i do say waitresses because they are all women -rrb- are all showing their midriffs and a little bit ditzy . it took awhile to get drink refills and to pay our bill , but it was fine . there you have it ... 3 stars for saddle ranch for now . i 'll be back for the beer tower -lrb- not the food -rrb- if and when i return !		3		0
from may 20 , 2010 -- or those of you who love the mediocre food and service of caffe boa ahwatukee -lrb- no relation -rrb- , do n't go to the tempe big sister . tempe 's caffe boa , headed by chef payton curry , is sleek , friendly and a foodie 's dream . the new spring/summer menu , just launched , shows the kitchen 's skill . homemade charcuterie , good cheese selection , a tasty burger and inventive panini . the crown to the whole menu ? the new gnocchi dish ... homemade , soft on the inside , crunchy on the outside sauteed in browned butter and sage , served with preserved lemon , grilled favas and a fried egg on top . died and gone to heaven . service is relaxed but not slow and cordial . so happy we tempeans now have an outstanding fresh , seasonal , local gem in our neck of the woods . why travel further ? update : payton no longer there ... restaurant has gone back to old menu . have n't had the opportunity to try it again , but friend just went there last night and did n't seem to have many complaints . it is a higher end , food centric restaurant that tempe needs more of .		3		0
it 's tiki time . b - -rrb- grab cocktails left and right . dr. funk ? hell yeah . mai tai ? packs a punch every time . now sit on the patio and people watch in style ... and if you like island food but you 're not feeling adventurous , this is perfect for you . i tried the pulled pork sandwich and the jerk chicken . the jerk sauce is a bit sweet , and not nearly spicy enough for my taste . but it 's still tasty . my pulled pork sandwich had an amazing slaw ... the overall sweetness , and the heavily buttered bun was a bit overpowering . i do n't need everything to taste like cinnamon and allspice . i think i 'll come here for the cocktails and appetizers . those sweet potato fries are the best i 've had !		3		0
after reading the reviews , i could n't wait to eat there last night . but i have to say , i just was n't that impressed . maybe my expectations were too high . i thought it was pretty good food , but nothing great . after reading the food can be pretty hot , i ordered the red chile chimi which is milder . i wish i had ordered the green . the red had no heat whatsoever and it needed a little more flavor , but it was n't bad . i thought the beans were okay , consistency of homemade , but the seasoning reminded me of canned beans . the guacamole seemed a little over processed to me , not bad , but not to die for . overall , it was good enough that i would give it another chance and try something different next time .		3		0
so i went here the other day on the tour de coffee de phoenix ... ftw . i ordered my usual ... a latte and the bf got a mocha -lrb- the ... unusual i guess -rrb- . my latte was fine , not the best , but fine . it was a little watery ... i think this may be due to the barista , not the coffee . that is a trend i see with matt pool 's places ... bad service . we got here and waited like 5 minutes for someone to come out of the back and help us ... kinda weird . also , it took the barista about 10 minutes to make a latte ... whoa . anyway , the reason for the low star - age is the bf 's mocha ... ugh . it tasted like a hot chocolate milk made with hershey 's syrup . no coffee flavor . no intense chocolate flavor . just bad flavor . they do have a cool way to pay with a credit card ... on an ipad ... and the space is cool looking , but i probably would n't go back .		3		0
if i was to title this review , it would be `` time to freshen up '' . when people go to mastro 's they expect first class service and food . in my experience , they just did an okay job at both . my fiancé proposed to me at home and then had reservations at mastro 's for dinner that night . it was a big evening for us -lrb- obviously -rrb- and he wanted to make sure we celebrated . he spent so much time and effort planning the proposal that he did n't even think to look at the menu for vegetarian options . he assumed that they would have some ... well they did n't . my only option was to order side dishes individually or they would give me a platter of 4 smaller sized sides . side dishes are not a meal , with the level of chefs they have working in this restaurant they should be able to put a composed dish on the plate . while my side dishes were good , i will never go back . vegetarians , vegans and gluten-free diners should have at least one option on every menu -lrb- a salad and sides does not count , that is what we order in addition to our meal -rrb- . ten years ago , a restaurant could get away with this , but not now . but , i am not going to totally bash the food , because the butter cake was to die for , but that is definitely not enough to make me want to go back . okay , now for the service . let me just say that we waited 5 minutes to be greeted , then another 5 minutes to place our drink order ... and then another 5 minutes for our drinks . not exactly `` wowing '' the customer from the start . our server was nice , but overall the service was slow . it was the day before thanksgiving , so they may have just been understaffed . at the end of the meal we waited at least 10 minutes after we were finished with desserts and drinks for the server to come around again so we could ask for our check . after reading this review , you may wonder why i even gave them a 3 ? well it is mastro 's , they do have a great ambiance and my hottie said his steak was amazing . if they want to stay relevant with all the great dining popping up in old town , they need to freshen up their food menu , narrow down their cocktail list to real `` specialties '' and put more attention into the customer 's experience .		3		0
good burger , awful fries , high prices . since i appear to be the only person i know not on the five guys bandwagon , i decided to give this location a try . i 'm still not jumping on board . there 's nothing wrong with the location . cityscape is a great spot in downtown phoenix . perfect for the busy lunch crowd , and five guys is open for dinner and on weekends . for a fast food burger in this area , it pretty much is as good as it gets . the location is very clean and the staff was very friendly . my walking distance options are five guys and mcdonald 's ; five guys is always going to win that fight . as i stated earlier , the burger itself is good . i learned my lesson from the scottsdale location , and ordered the little hamburger this time . it 's a good size and not too unreasonably priced , but still more than i want to pay for a quick service meal . the huge amount of toppings are wonderful -lrb- but i can not figure out how all the toppings are free yet cheese is an additional 60 cents -rrb- . it 's also a little too messy and greasy to me , but that 's probably what appeals to others . the big problem i have with five guys is the fries . why is there no small ? the amount that comes in a regular order is way too much . while you certainly get the value of what you pay for in the quantity , there should be a smaller and cheaper option . you also do not get the value of what you pay for in quality . this time i experimented with the cajun fries . just awful . way too overseasoned and soggy . i left out the cup so my coworkers could finish them off . not too many people seemed interested . a little more than seven dollars for a burger and an unnecessary amount of fries . no drink -lrb- had water back at my office -rrb- . more money than i want to spend on greasy fast food . but -lrb- if you did n't get enough food -rrb- , there 's also complimentary -lrb- very salty -rrb- peanuts you can gnaw on , too .		3		0
i ate there friday night at 7:15 . it was n't crowded . there was no reason for this terrible experience . first let me tell you that we had decided that we were going to p.j. for dinner two days prior . so , i had my mouth ready for the roasted veggie salad . it is one of my top favorite menu items . it was raw . no , not joking . raw zucchini . raw summer squash . raw carrots . not lightly cooked as if it had been quickly cooked in a wok . cold from the fridge , hard , hurt your teeth -- raw . to add insult to injury , the oil tasted very odd , and there was a lot of it . i ate the salad . i was hungry and we had people waiting for us elsewhere , and my date is very shy . i also ordered the tzatziki . not a good thing that night . it was underseasoned yogurt soup . what a travesty . my date ordered a greek salad with chicken and his chicken was cold and dry . he also ordered a side of roasted potatoes -lrb- which we usually share -rrb- and they were so bad neither one of us finished the plate . we spent a great deal of time trying to figure out what was making them taste bad , and really could n't figure out what went wrong . some mislabeled spice bottle in the kitchen perhaps . the experience only gets worse from here on in . our waiter left without saying goodbye . our new waitress then came up and very properly introduced herself . this is where it gets really bad . my date eats super slowly and i ate my salad super fast just to get rid of the terrible thing , so our table was a bit lopsided . the waitress tried so hard to get rid of us that it actually pissed me off . i finally told her `` why do n't you just let him eat ? '' and for the first time in my life left exactly a 10 % tip . if she had asked us if we wanted a to-go box one more time i would have screamed . my date actually caved in one time and told her to go ahead and bring the boxes and she looked like he had given her diamonds . we are going back , because we have both loved pita jungle for years , but this location is skating on thin ice . i will update you on our next visit !		3		0
great staff . the first time i visited a z ` tejas , it was at the location in phoenix for brunch . i did n't even know there was a location in chandler . at night this location has a `` grown and sexy '' like vibe with the dim lighting . we went to celebrate a friend 's birthday . love that they have a whole veggie section on the menu , it made choosing my meal so simple . i had the wild mushroom enchiladas , my friends had the salmon . the food was good but the portions are a bit small . my friends enjoyed their cocktails and the ancho fudge pie was yum ! staff is really kind and accommodating . love the cornbread !		3		0
not bad , first time here - i had driven past a few time and decided to finally get some carry out , and man we got the carry out - they gave it to us in a box . place was nice , it was actually packed when we went in to pick up the food . everyone was friendly and the food was ready and perfect . the reviewed the order with us so we knew nothing was missing . we had : cream cheese puffs - could have been better , but i still ate them wonton soup - very good , and really good crunchies egg roll - i am not a huge eggroll person but was good for an eggroll shrimp chow mien - i loved this ! was a really big fan , i had n't ordered matthew did and i ended up eating it all mongolian beef - was good , your standard mongolian beef mu shu pork - very good , and something i noticed a couple days later , usually the wrappers get hard and you can use to eat left overs the next day , these wrappers were perfect 2 days later i think in the end , it probably depends what you like and what you order . i have had better mongolian beef , but this place had great pork . i will go back and for a place that does n't cost and arm and a leg it works as a neighborhood joint .		3		0
this place was decent . my work had a holiday party on the porch , well more of a holiday get together . regardless , we had some drinks , chips and dip , and tacos . overall the service was decent . the waitress did take a drink order and forgot . no big deal . the tacos were great other then the carne asada taco . it was overloaded with cabbage , and was lackluster in flavor . i 'd recommend the brisket , they were amazing ! i would definitely go back again .		3		0
i ordered the peanut panang chicken ... i rqstd to the waitress that i wanted extra bell pepper . when it came , it had - no - bell peppers at all ... i actually did n't realize this until about 5 mins into eating it . could not find our waitress , i waited about 7 mins , finally , i had to get up & search for her . i found another waiter & told him my problem . he took my dish , but then came back to tell me that they are `` all out of green bell peppers . would i like red bell peppers '' . i said yes , of course . this whole experience has put a sour taste in my mouth about this place , which is next door to the ` mediocre ' good egg on central . i like wild thaiger on central much better instead !		3		0
how do they do it ?! i could barely speak the words of what i wanted in my order - based on the number 13 menu item , and then boom ! there it was . i do n't mean to sound like a complicated order , but i know that i was pretty particular and it should have taken a little longer considering the line of people who seemed to be ahead of me . but somehow , they had my order ready in what seemed like one minute and everyone else seemed to disappear behind my gluttonous inhales of delicious simplicity that is otherwise a deli sandwhich . i will have to re-visit that place . stand by .		3		0
this is such an awesome concept with so much potential ! i like the idea of a trendy , downtown bowling alley with a hip bar and snazzy feel . -lrb- i also love old school bowling alleys as well - especially the bars ... top notch ! -rrb- anyhow , lucky strike looks really cool . the main point being `` looks '' . when you actually touch something and focus , this place is made of complete crap . it just looks nice because it is new . the balls are cheap and generic . the floor , lanes and light fixtures are worse than ikea . they have little plastic stools that probably cost a buck . give this place a little wear and the poor quality will start to show . there also are n't a lot of lanes ? the bar/restaurant area is bigger than the actual bowling alley portion . hopefully the entrance is finally completed because we had to walk up some creepy closed in stairwell strewn with old food . if you are going to charge over 20 bucks for two hours of bowling and attempt to be snazzy and upscale , then commit to that . we went around happy hour time and they had some `` deals '' if you want to call them that . the glasses of wine were so very tiny . about a half a glass each . our server was nice , but really slow . so we would order another drink as soon as she brought one so it would time out -lrb- about 15 min between -rrb- . i do n't really get it either since we were the only people bowling . better hope you are n't a vegetarian because your only option on the menu we had was soft pretzel sticks . at least they were really tasty and had nice presentation . this place has good potential for sure . come and enjoy . i just do n't think the quality is worth the cost . .		3		0
though i 've known about the existence of this place for quite some time , i have always been hesitant to visit bar smith , not out of an aversion to drinking and dancing , but because i know some of the guys who work/frequent this place , and some of them have n't really been briefed on the whole `` jetta '' thing . oh hi , um , i hope this does n't weird you out , but i already know you . we used to take a class together . you might not remember me ... i was a boy then . so , uh , what 's new with you ? when dottsy z announced that , as a conclusion to her birthday pub crawl , she wanted to go dancing at bar smith , i was at first a little wary . but everyone seemed so excited at the idea , and as the pictures of the pub crawl will show you , i was looking fucking hawt last night . so i figured to hell with parliamentary procedure , we had some dancing to do . after navigating the diabolical labyrinth that are the one way streets that surrounded the place , nathan and i showed up about twenty minutes after everyone else . since it was after 130 in the am , they did n't charge us cover , and after i gave the security the old `` please , i 'm working on the driver 's license thing , do n't make a big deal about it '' eye fluttering , we were let in without any hassle . within thirty seconds of stepping inside we spotted a man dressed in a cardboard and tinfoil robot costume , doing the robot . then and there that i decided this place was at least getting three stars . the scene on the rooftop bar was like every halloween party in hell -lrb- or heaven , for you overachievers -rrb- . way-buffer-than-humanly-reasonable hipsters shook their bon bons with joker nurses and s & m fairies as bass-driven boogies pounded our ears to near deafness . one could even spot adam m over in the corner by the dj dancing with himself -lrb- either that or his partner had wisely moved out of the way of his cyclone of dancing fury -rrb- i like to imagine that no matter where i am in the universe , adam m at any time can be found dancing in the corner . seriously . only phoenix would have rooftop dancing in november . that 's why i love this city . at first i felt a little awkward about dancing , but when i realized that dottsy and kevin h were taking pictures , i knew that there was no going back , and even i starting shaking my groove thing , despite being about three or four inches taller than every one else in the club . i tried so very hard to minimize the damage done to the other patrons , but i just know someone will read this review and say to your friend ! `` hey , remember that behemoth chick who gave you that black eye ! she wrote about it on yelp ! '' though i 've been to many a club , last night marked the first time a total stranger walked up to me and asked to take a picture of me . every day i 'm going to google `` tranny dancing bar smith rose in mouth '' until i find that picture . my pose was simply too good to be kept in someone 's memory card . the whole night we were there -lrb- in this case , `` night '' means about 45 minutes -rrb- we kept dusting off chalk off of each other . the walls were literally coated in it . surprisingly , i was n't as annoyed with this as i was disappointed . i was hoping that perhaps some sort of hipster robin hood was literally just throwing drugs at passersby , but it turns out we were just dancing too close to the walls . oh well . i admit , i feel a small tug at my conscience , giving this place a three-star review based on 45 minutes spent on the rooftop dancing and brushing `` mystery powder '' off my tits . but , alas , it was enough to win me over , and i will definitely agree to a second date -lrb- perhaps even a third if i can actually get into the ladies room -rrb- , where i 'll order some food and drinks and write yet another one of those `` useful and factual '' reviews i 'm so well known for .		3		0
family owned thai restaurants are incredibly consistent . i have yet to have a bad curry , pad thai , or stay . it is always very vibrant and flavorful . thai spices carries on that tradition of consistency as everything was good and to our expectations . nothing more , nothing less . the location is diverse and clean . while it had the customary pictures of thai royalty on the wall , the decor was decidedly different and contemporary urban . all in all a good spot . a solid candidate for the best thai in mesa .		3		0
as expensive as this place is , the food was mediocre . 2 stars on the food , 3 stars for the service . i got the rainforest burger with cheese and it was something that i could make and i have never made a burger in my life . flimsy on the fries , too . hubby got the turkey wrap with tomato basil soup . the soup tasted like marinara sauce and the hubby said he was glad the waiter got his order wrong by only giving him half the turkey wrap . he 's usually easy to please . my daughter barely had 2 bites of her mac/cheese . frame of reference : she devours the mac/cheese at paradise bakery on the up side my daughter was entertained with all the sights and sounds . the decor and ambience is fun for kids . she really enjoyed the `` experience '' but i do n't think we 'd ever come here again . our meal ended up being $ 49 but that 's with 15 % gratuity and two drinks , too . pricey for a mediocre meal . come here for the ambience but do n't expect much from the quality of food . meh , i 've had better . i really should 've given this place 2 stars but i 'm feeling generous today .		3		0
first , you have to know that this place is casual . wear your flip flops , hat on backward , and your asu t-shirt , and you 'll be fine . lots of tvs , pretty busy on game nights , and there 's a patio . the best part ? kids were sat on the restaurant side . woohoo ! as for the food , just embrace the whole peanuts on the floor thing . really . it was hard for me to chuck them on the floor , too , but it 's not really a reason to dock a star ... the food and service will take care of that for you , because it 's as casual as the atmosphere . the service was just a bit slow and sloppy . hubby was given the wrong sandwich , so i shared half of my turkey ruben with him . it was a fine sandwich -- not great , but not bad . hence the 3 stars ! his cheesesteak came back out looked really yummy but the cheese sauce just did n't have any flavor . my blue moons were excellent . : -rrb- so if you want a fun , casual night out , just do n't go with high expectations and i think you 'll be just fine !		3		0
pretty big disappointment for me after all these great reviews praising pancakes of the gods . everything here seems pretty average to me , only slightly ahead the likes of cracker barrel . i compare it to cracker barrel not because it has a ton of crap all over the place and a tacky gift shop , but because the food is pretty flavorless except when they decide to heap on the sugar . had the famous apple pancake . which does have a delicious apple cinnamon topping , but on top of a thick , spongy , bizarre apple pancake . i 'm definitely not a fan of the pancake base and the whole thing made me od on apples and sugar . i think it would be better just to have the spiced apples on the side of a dish . the omelets are amazingly fluffy and flavorless . i had cheddar in my omelet , right ? for good measure , we ordered some coconut pancakes on the side with the omelet . pretty average pancakes with a little bit of coconut mixed in and some intensely pineapple syrup . again i oded on pineapple without any good pancake substance . i 'm guessing the people who love this place are more into sugary toppings on their pancakes , while i am in it for the cake experience . coffee also tasted like it came from denny 's . to aggravate the situation , this location has all the atmosphere of a village inn on sugar roids . elderly patrons trying to clank there way through all the crowded tables with their walkers , angry scottsdale douche bags yelling about how stupid it is for a restaurant to not take credit cards , church-goers sequestering large sections for a apple god chasers , and morbidly obese patrons with fashion statements like tinkerbell sweat pants with a hot pink shirt and crocs and a rainbow coach purse . it all just made me wish i went to the good egg at park central mall instead . would 've cost less too .		3		0
finding a place with a large patio on a hot summer day can not be considered a great find . we arrived and parking was so tight we had to park on a near by neighbor hood street . inside it was crowded with a long line to order . most items are available in regular and xl size . i went with a regular vegetarian quesadilla $ 3.75 and `` americas corn '' 2.50 , and was then given a number for my table . my quesadilla arrived and it was much smaller than i expected and less cheesy , but the sautéed onions were good . the corn is just a corn on the cob , covered in mayo and then some shredded cheese . each dish comes with a small piece of cucumber and radish . on the table there is a large selection of hot sauces however they did not taste fresh to me . my co workers got the carne asada and they liked it . they have a 2-6 happy hr with $ 1 tacos cheap chips and beer i may try it again for a late lunch .		3		0
my husband and i went to rooftop yoga at the palomar , and wanted to grab dinner nearby afterwards . we were looking to eat something lighter , so we stopped into squid ink . the decor was very nice , clean , & modern and our server was great . we opted to sit at the sushi bar and ordered a yellowtail roll , tuna roll , garlic edamame , and beef & broccoli . the sushi rolls were good , but a little pricey at $ 7 per roll . the garlic edamame was very flavorful . however , the beef & broccoli was pretty disappointing . while the beef & broccoli were cooked perfectly , it was pretty much ruined by the sauce . the sauce was way too sweet , and the dish was drowning in it . cooked dishes do n't seem to be their forte , and the sushi is little bit pricier and no better than a few other sushi places in phoenix . so i will most likely only return for happy hour , as their regular priced options are not a very good value .		3		0
we had a living social discount and i was excited to try the steakhouse . i was not impressed with donavan 's . went to the uncrowded bar and no one served us while we waited for about 15 min . we got sat down to a table that was weirdly in the spotlight . all other tables had that dimmed mood lighting but we were right under a super bright recessed light . service was slow at first with getting our drinks and they even ran out of the drink that i wanted from the menu . service did get better towards the end . food was okay , kind of bland for my taste . we tipped a little over 20 % of the full price b/c i think there 's a stigma that groupon/living social users do not tip well or for the full price . there are better steakhouses out there like durrants or mastro 's . wo n't be back .		3		0
this is ling & louie 's flagship store which they are using to work out their concept so that they can franchise many more . unsurprisingly , they still have quite a few kinks to work out . the cuisine is pan asian which is not easy to execute given how much variation there is . taipei pepper beef had a nice kick and the filet mignon cubes were beautifully charred . the sauce was very tasty but do n't know why they have to put it all over rice so that you have no control of how much rice to eat with it . in fact , this dish needs way more rice given how strongly flavored the sauce is . the lemongrass mahi mahi was a big letdown after starting on such a high note . the firm flesh of the fish just does not lend itself well to deepfrying and the lemongrass is such a delicate herb that all flavor is lost in the frying process . the fried spinach leaves were not crispy and the sauces that accompanied the dish were sweet and boring - contrary to their tagline `` not for boring people '' . our waiter let the general manager know about our reaction and he immediately came over to speak to us . he offered to take the mahi mahi off our bill and comped us another taipei pepper beef to take with us . service is great and i 'm hoping the food will catch up to it . i 'd definitely go back for the beef dish and will hopefully have a better experience with other dishes . so until then ...		3		0
whatever you do stay away from this on new year 's eve !! : -rrb- i have never been to rogue bar before the nye 2013 event , bad idea to go to this place for nye , ya i know what i was thinkin ha . hey gim me and 'em some credit , they had a pay $ 30 and from there on all penny drinks ! that was a good deal , ofc they didnt have anything fancy to drink , but hey that 's a geat deal for alcohol as long as it does the job ; -rrb- . oh they didnt care about the pennies either :p well i was just disappointed with the event on nye , i was expecting something more atleast from the pics and fb event , i thought there would be people hanging upside down lol . that 's y i said dont go to a nye party there . -lrb- or any big day events :p -rrb- now that i have been there , i know what to expect and i am definitely going back to see if i can improve the rating : -rrb-		3		0
bloom is a part of the fox restaurant concepts and located in the upscale gainey ranch area of scottsdale . went with a friend for a lazy sunday lunch and sat in the outside patio . though the view of the patio is just the srpawling parking lot of the shopping complex , the nice weather in phoenix made it enjoyable . the menu looks very similar to one of its sister restaurants north -lrb- in kierland commons -rrb- . we had a glass of sangria which was nice and refreshing . my friend had the tuna salad and i had the salmon . the food was good . another similarity with north is the lovely butter they give with the bread -lrb- though the butter at north is better , also we had to ask for the bread , it didnt come automaticallyas one would expect -rrb- . a good experience .		3		0
this place used to be great but now , it 's just average . the bread is great , do n't get me wrong , but i find that the prices and quality of the rest of the ingredients just do n't mesh . as an example , when we last dined here , my husband ordered the smoked salmon omelette . we had to dig through the entire thing to find the one piece of smoked salmon in it . the breakfast potatoes tend to be mealy and served luke warm instead of hot and the herbs on them are lacking . i need me some more sea salt and rosemary ! the sandwiches are a good size , it 's true and could easily be shared for a light lunch but i just feel like the quality of this place is not as good as it once was now that it 's a super busy family place . i will still eat here when i hit the mall but i wo n't go out of my way to visit this place . i do like their turkey breast and brie sandwich but i wish the mustard was a little heartier . i love stoneground mustards , though , and i suppose i could ask for extra . this place is busy , busy so arrive with a buddy and have them scope out a table while you order .		3		0
i had my first nando 's experience last night . the place is good . i would say this place falls above chain mexican places , but falls short of smaller independent places . when we arrived we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a table , but we were seated within 15 minutes . the salsa served with the chips was ok , pretty bland if you ask me . the menu is pretty big and has many , many options to go with from the specialty plates to the combo platters . the portions are very big . half the party i went with took home over half their meal . the food was above average . i had a healthy portion of beans , rice and the enchiladas were big . i do wish there was more red sauce . most of the enchiladas were covered with cheese . i was n't a fan of the onion inside my beef enchilada . i wish i knew about this before . not a fan of chunk onions in my food . my biggest complaint was the rice . the rice just did n't measure up to other mexican/spanish rice . rice is one of my favorite things when eating mexican . the service was very good . our order was out quickly , sodas refreshed and bill all served quickly . you get good value for the good served here . most plates were around $ 11-13 i can see myself going here in the future . 3.5 stars		3		0
walked in on a thursday at 10 am . half-empty , so we sat down , checked the menu , ordered , and received our drinks in 5 minutes . maybe 5 minutes later the food arrived . coffee cake was phenomenal -- even though it appears it is `` outsourced '' from another bakery . chilaquiles were pretty good -- very spicy . chicken fried steak was ok -- gravy was loaded with bacon rather than the normal sausage i 'm used to . ham steak very tasty . overall a pretty good dining experience . very eclectic interior -- warm , lots of light , very clean . friendly staff and lightning-fast service .		3		0
not quite what i expected , but still a good time . the highlights : - waterloo , an abba tribute band playing the night i was there , was amazing . they did a great job and had the audience dancing in the aisles . - the food was a festival of deep-fried , artery-hardening goodness that you can only find at fairs and some sports events . - i tried my first ever funnel cake . yes , it was good - i purchased a corn dog from a vendor that was missing his front teeth and wanted a sip of my beer . no , i did not give him one . the not-so-great : - $ 20 to park !? i am not familiar with the area and probably could have done better on this one . - where were the cows !? you can not have a fair without cows ! i saw a large building filled with llamas , but no cows . another building , that may have had them was closed . : -lrb- overall i am glad i went , but maybe should have gone during the day to be able to see more exhibits . in the evening it is more like a really crowded and kind of dirty amusement park , but with drunk people . i will still go back next year ... : -rrb-		3		0
this was actually my first ra that i 've been too , and it sure did n't disappoint . we hit the 5pm happy hour after work , and though the place was packed , there was still room and no waiting . but to start , let 's talk about the parking ; it 's old town scottsdale , so you have to expect parking to be crazy , especially on a friday evening . fortunately , ra is located at the end of a street with a massive parking garage . so a short walk and you 're there ! the service was great , and even during the busy rush of happy hour , the waitress was prompt when we asked for something . the coolest part of the whole night was actually when we checked in on foursquare . after checking in , we got a special promo of free edamame and miso soup , all we had to do is show our phones to the waitress . awesome ! when we ordered , most of us got the vegas roll , and what a beautiful dish ! the size was smaller than other places -lrb- like koi & sushi brokers , they have much bigger portions -rrb- , but it tasted delicious . at half off because of happy hour , we could n't argue with a $ 7 bill for each of us . outside of happy hour , i would n't go , but only because of the size of the rolls . as tasty as they were , it 's not worth $ 14 . sushi brokers totally has larger servings , and at the same -lrb- or less -rrb- price .		3		0
have you ever been to a place that you really wanted to like ? it 's close to home , great atmosphere , great ambiance , ambitious menu , and you hope this could be a new place to frequent but the food turns out to be not that good/borderline bad . that was bootleggers for me . first , my friend and i ordered the nachos , the pork belly sandwich and the wings half in the miso glaze and half in the peanut butter and jelly glaze . everything was over cooked and i mean everything . the pork belly came out dry , and the wings were almost inedible because the miso was reduced to pure saltiness . the pbj wings had no flavor at all . the wings did seem fresh and were all drums which was nice . i will say the nachos were pretty good . tons of guac , sharp cheddar and pork but the pork didnt really shine in this dish . to be fair , it seemed like all the food was almost there but not quite . we told the waitress the wings were bad and the owner came out and said he tasted the sauce and we we 're completely right , apologized and took the wings off of our tab . i could n't ask for a better response and because of him i will be willing to try bootleggers again after the kinks get worked out .		3		0
i 've been to true food a bunch of times but i still ca n't make up my mind as to how much i like it . the food is consistently good , kale salad is awesome , tacos , pizza , soup are all good and i love that they have interesting drink choices - i tried the sparkling iced tea the last time and it was great . service can be spotty , i even had one waiter sell me on a vegan sweet potato soup only to take a bite and find it had chicken - not good , not good at all , that 's a big mistake - they were completely unapologetic about it and blamed the kitchen staff for the mix up . my main gripe with this place is flies , yes flies . every time i 've been here there are flies in the restaurant . the last time i was here my husband looked at me and said , `` oh right that 's why we do n't come here more often , i forgot about the flies '' . all things considered , it 's just ok .		3		0
i really have to say that my experience was just okay . i walked in the wrong way and got ovewhelmed . there are 2 doors , one is for the bar and one for the restaurant . because it was so crowded everywhere we could n't figure out what door we needed to enter . we finally got inside and seated in the presidential room . the doorways and rooms are so tight and clausterphobic . everytime i needed something i would have to flag down the waitress and i felt like we were bugging her . the food was just okay . i ordered the veggie burrito that i liked but would just get it from the take out window next time where it is even cheaper than inside the restaurant .		3		0
i can walk to calabria 's from my office , so i have probably # 1 eaten too many of their subs and # 2 become partial to the owner . the owner 's a nice guy , i swear ... really . ok , somewhere underneath that gruff exterior and short greeting , he 's a nice guy . tell him your a boston red sox fan and he 'll lighten up . and know what you want to order , because lunch time -lrb- the rush hour -rrb- is tough . you can call ahead too which works great for them and you . for office meetings , this is a fantastic people-pleaser . almost everyone can find something on the menu , however , meat-eaters will be more satisfied with both the selection and the actual food . the specialty orange and lemon sodas , the sides of olives , cold desserts , and coffee round out the menu . their veggie sandwich -lrb- with cheese -rrb- is what every vegetarian hates -- a boring , tasteless sub . my advice to making it better is do n't forget your toppings . calabria 's only has a few things like lettuce and tomato that come standard on their subs , so add , add , add . toppings do n't cost you anything and trust me , adding pepperocinis to that veggie sub can mean the difference between happy lunch time and sad ! their eggplant parm is decent , though not as good as other places around the valley . for sure , if you love cheese , the caprese will be your saving grace sub . besides these subs or a salad , as a vegetarian , your options are limited -lrb- and were n't that good to begin with -rrb- . so , for vegetarians , search elsewhere for the best eats ... for all the rest of you meat-eating folks , enjoy your italian with a side of sox .		3		0
ah , cue club . i have to agree it 's a little over-rated , but it has some positives to it too . i do like the pool tables ... there are several , so even if there 's a wait , there 's pretty good turnover . honestly , i 'd probably never come if it were n't for the allure of pool . the long island iced teas are good and cheap . the electric lemonade , or amf , or whatever they 're calling it this week , are good too ... the same thing as a long island but with added blue curacao . lines can get long , and i do n't think it 's worth waiting for if that 's the case . it can get really crowded too , be that a good thing or a bad thing for you . i prefer to come earlier , when i can play some pool without fighting over the tables or the space , enjoy a drink with my friends , and hear each other talk . for a crazy late-night , i 'd go somewhere else .		3		0
nice coffee & art/craft shop in a residential area of downtown phoenix that participates in monthly art detour . they serve coffee , espresso drinks , italian sodas , bagels , sandwiches & organic green salads . they also sell art , clothing and jewelry in an art collective . there 's a book & game library in back . friendly service . the only problem with this space is seating . 3 bar stools at the counter and three more around a tall table in the front room and a long table in the library room are it for indoor seating . wednesday night is craft night , when the back room seating is taken up by people 's sewing & other craft supplies . there are some picnic tables in the lawn outdoors and a small table on the shaded front porch . in fall , winter & spring this will be super , but during the summer heat it 'll be intolerable sitting outdoors after noon .		3		0
i wonder if i will be banned from heaven if i do n't give this place at least 4 stars ? oh well , i 'm taking the risk ... three stars - there you go . i have been looking forward to trying st. francis for many months and my experience was anticlimactic . the interior architecture is as uninteresting as the exterior . i 'm not sure what saintly images i had conjured up , but i was imagining some sort of religious overtone . nope . i was disappointed by lunch . the menu is n't interesting nor diverse . i ordered a onion burger and my friend orders a blah salad . i hope to try it again for dinner - given all those 4 star reviews . but honestly , after the lunch experience , i 'm not in a rush to go back .		3		0
we made the trek down from northern phoenix to get some authentic ramen . i wanted to love this place and i wanted it to be worth the trip , but it just was n't . the decor is as previously described - you sort of time warp back to the 80 's but it is clean and well loved by its owner . they do have a lot of authentic menu items and a great kids meal , but the ramen was just not that good . its downfall was the broth . hubby got the salmon chirashi which was also not that fresh . if i 'm in the area , i may give it another try for the don-buris .		3		0
this was our second time at sonora , and overall it was a decent place with warm woods , brick , and sautillo tile . the lighting was not too dark . where we sat , in the hallway like middle section , was way too stuffy , however , and we were shocked by how much cooler it was when we stepped into the main area . hubby had the vanilla porter , which he really liked . it was black as my soul , and probably a little sweeter . not my cup of tea . my hefe was very disappointing - the worst i 've had in arizona , frankly . it was dull and muddy tasting - something was just plain wrong . my dinner was quite tasty . i had the haddock with a wonderfully spunky tartar sauce and their awesome freshly made kettle chips . the fish was huge , with a tasty batter , not at all greasy , but a tad overdone . hubby had the cottage pie , which was good , but we 've recently had far better at tim finnegan 's . his dinner came with a cup of clam chowder - it was zesty and really different . we both liked it . sonora is a place we will likely come back to . it has a good vibe .		3		0
every meal comes with a kiss , we were informed shortly after sitting down . i was going to ask if we had to cook our own food or how that whole thing worked out , but did n't . ktc was a solid 3 stars for our breakfast this morning . i ordered the canjun bene ; paul , the belgian waffle ; and jason , the biscuits and gravy . three orders of mini muffins arrived shortly thereafter , with real butter and apple butter that was at the table . as others have stated , the muffins were great . our meals arrived in a timely manner and we all dug in . paul polished off his waffle promptly while jason and i slowly enjoyed our meals . i honestly have to say i wish i did n't eat so many muffins because i was n't able to finish my eggs , which were wonderful . the creole seasoning added to the hollandaise sauce added a terrific flavor and just a little heat . the decor made me feel like i was back home in northwest ohio . that does n't add the the appeal for me , but some enjoy those things . while service during our meal was attentive -lrb- i drink a lot of water during a meal and their glasses were pretty small , but i was refilled several times -rrb- . however , after our plates were cleared , we sat around for almost ten minutes before we could flag down our server for the bill . which was when we also received our kisses . hershey 's kisses . cute , but i rarely eat candy . still , cute .		3		0
ok , so until i stepped up to the second floor -lrb- to use the cardio machines -rrb- i did n't really recognize the full coliseum view of the gym . you can pretty much see everything - except free weights - from up there . that mat area where you were stretching ? yep , we can see you . the stairmaster where you are giving up a lung ? we can see you . the spin room all the way across the gym ? we can see you . silly me did n't realize the full racquetball courts were visible to everyone everywhere . so while i was using the back end of the court to suffer my way through burpees -lrb- in what i thought was relative privacy -rrb- anyone could have gotten a good chuckle over that one . so dress nice kids ! -lrb- i 'm too old to use that term myself , but there do appear to be a number of asu kids who frequent the gym . -rrb- my feedback is from a saturday which i recognize is vastly different from a m-f visit . i was there around 1ish and i would say the weight machines -lrb- arms and chest of course ! -rrb- were pretty busy with guys . i was happy to see a treadmill in the midst of the arm/chest machines . it 's a nice idea to be able to throw in a quick sprint while downstairs instead of having to go upstairs . the good : tv 's are within ready access so there 's no need to squint . there are only two rows of cardio machines so everyone gets a good view , which kind of rocks . there was only one treadmill out of service . the lifefitness machines have seen better days , but are ok . the treadmills are about average . ladies locker room has a lounge in it . why you need a room with a tv -lrb- with comfy looking arm chairs -rrb- is beyond me . -lrb- there is a tv in the main locker room area . -rrb- however , should you find yourself in there , you could stretch as there were yoga mats on the floor , as well as some free weights . interesting . i was impressed to hear that there is both a wet and dry sauna . oh , and a hot jacuzzi . also , a neat little machine to squeeze the water out of your bathing suit . this is a step above the amenities offered at the gym i 've been currently going to . the only ding i would voice about the locker room is that none of the showers have a nozzle . it 's like being doused by a fire hose . plenty of water pressure ! last , but definitely not least , is that harold g. is a personal trainer here . he moved from highland and 20th . folks , if you can get on his calendar , do it . seriously . i 'm a much fitter -lrb- and hell , better looking -rrb- person as a result of his training program . i 've dropped * more than * ten dress sizes . no chump change there . -lrb- see my before | recent photo in my profile -rrb- . also he 's pretty space balls amazing about seeing you all the way through . even though i do n't train in the same gym anymore - he 's still there for me . i really appreciate that . the bad : there are n't any paper towels provided by the soap -lrb- that i saw not a single person use -rrb- to clean machines with . seems odd . the kid up front seemed very invested in using his cell phone instead of talking to people . update : in general about la fitness training . that stuff works . i just went in for a fitness eval and measurements seven months out . hot damn i 'm happy . http://tinyurl.com/llb3caz		3		0
this cutie pie cottage restaurant serves up high quality lunch fare at a reasonable price . it 's a great soup , salad , sandwich kind of place for ladies who lunch ... there 's the rub . the place is tiny and the wait is ridiculous , even if you try to beat the crowd by going early . and the veggie sandwich is n't very good . but other things on the menu are . if you do have 2 hours for lunch and come here , be sure to get a cookie . the cookies alone are worth the wait .		3		0
went there today at lunch with mrs. had heard good things about their breakfasts but it was too late for that . ms. had mushroom soup and a sandwich . . turkey and brie with cranberries . i had mushroom soup and ham and gruyere cheese . both sandwhiches were served hot . wife declared the soup wonderful . i thought it was a bit thin . it was good though , and had a bit of pepper in it but not overly so . this is because of the cajun roots that the french groc . has . their cold case had several tempting items in it . ms. wants to go back but i 'm thinking i want to give it another try before putting it on my permanent `` go to '' list . price for two sandwhiches and two cups of soup was $ 19.00		3		0
my husband and i came to fuego tacos when they were having a special fixed menu and were pleasantly surprised . we both had a drink , an appetizer to share , our own entrees , and a dessert to share . for our drinks , i had this rum concoction that was both really fruity and strong . i really liked it ! my husband had this ginger ale drink - like a dark and stormy . he was n't too impressed , but he did n't come for the drinks anyway . for our appetizer , we had the empanadas - puff pastry with ground beef and cheese . i really liked these , but another miss in my husband 's eyes . for dinner , we each ordered a signature entrée - two tacos with rice and black beans . the black beans were lacking in flavor - no spices at all ! however , the tacos were good . i ordered the pernil asado , which is pork with mango salsa . my husband ordered the short rib barbacoa , which had hints of pineapple and spice . while they are not the best tacos in the world , we enjoyed them . as our evening came to a close , our waitress forgot to bring our dessert out and we had to remind her that we ordered the churros . she quickly brought us out some . again , not the best churros , but still cinnamony and sugary . our experience was n't bad , so we came back another time to enjoy dinner . this time the place was n't as packed as our first time here and the tacos tasted the same . overall , it 's a decent place but parking is a hassle . if it was located somewhere else , we 'd probably frequent it more often .		3		0
it 's cinco de mayo and this place is deserted . it has n't even been opened that long . i realize it 's a monday and everything , but people still go out and get drunk because it 's the 5th of may . loco patron across the street was packed . the dew-baggio factor was high at loco , but not so much at saddle ranch . i 've been to the one in l.a. many times and it 's really touristy and stupid and all , but i like it because i always meet cool people there who are visiting from someplace else as opposed to snarky asshole local la people who wo n't like me because i 'm not from la . . they also have stiff drinks in large amounts at reasonable prices , great food and good enough service considering how busy they always are . i think this sr in sosco has the potential to be the same eventually - but for now it 's just trying to figure itself out . i would n't even try to go when there 's a line , but that 's me . this being the case , i probably wo n't end up there when it 's really busy . i 'm kinda glad it 's here and i hope it settles down . i 'm pretty sure it 'll do well in this town .		3		0
i love german food and am thrilled whenever i discover a new restaurant , but i think the trick here is knowing what to order . i 'm going to give four stars for gemütlichkeit -lrb- coziness -rrb- , since i had a great time hanging out in the bar listening to accordion music coming from a table full of regulars . the bartender was also personable and conversational , so i stuck around after my first beer in order to quaff a second and order some grub off of the bar menu . i was intrigued by the bratwurst sliders . i 'm pretty tuned in to what decent bratwurst should taste like , since i lived in germany for nearly three years . i 'm partial to the thüringer style , which is what i came across growing up in west berlin , but everyone in the phoenix area appears to favor the nürnburger variety . the nürnburger style is perfectly acceptable to me however , as i had eaten a delicious one on the street at the mesa christkindlmarkt -lrb- christmas market -rrb- just a few days earlier . let me offer my comments about where black forest mill got it wrong . the bratwurst sliders were served with sauerkraut which was just too darn sour . i glanced at some fellow bar diners who left their sauerkraut nearly untouched . they really need to cut back on the brininess -lrb- rinse it better before preparing or add some apples to balance it out -rrb- . i do n't think this is an `` american palette '' issue ... it really is nearly inedible . now the bratwurst `` slider '' is a novel idea i applaud . but they were served on sweet dinner rolls which were soft -lrb- almost like hawaiian bread -rrb- . not only did they get soggy sitting in some sauerkraut juice drifting over from the other side of the plate , but it was the wrong flavor and texture counterpoint to the sausage . a sturdier more rustic european-type brötchen is what i was hoping for . and the bratwurst themselves were unremarkable . tasted boiled ... should 've been grilled . the mustard that came with them was the standard american substitute for german mustard , gulden 's spicy brown mustard , which is n't bad . however , i had just shopped next door at the german sausage company -lrb- presumably the same owners ? -rrb- and noticed they had authentic sharp german löwensenf . i think it would 've been a real treat if this restaurant could 've offered some of that on the side instead . so , call me picky if you must . but i think i know german food and , although i loved the atmosphere and the beer , i think the black forest mill could step it up a bit on the food preparation . i will post an update if i return and try something here that hits the mark . the waiter kept talking up the schnitzel sampler , and the gulasch and spätzle sound awfully tempting . but again , it might just be that you have to be careful what you order .		3		0
mediocre food the night we went , but it was busy and late so i did n't mind terribly . wine was tasty and reasonably priced , and the place had a fun atmosphere rolling . there was a fire pit and band out back , and house-y tunes inside after the band shut down . cute atmosphere -- a comfy little shack on grand with moderately high ceilings and a neat looking bar . the staff was great and posssibly psychic -- they comped one of my glasses of wine in apology for the so-so food that night . near closing time , everyone got out on the dance floor and shook it a lil ... a fun crowd and a few tunes i 'd never heard before . probably a ton of fun there if/when they have a good dj .		3		0
i first visited this spot for a `` foodies like us '' event back in june where i was able to sample food off of their menu . the event was held on their patio ; they had music and food set up around the patio and servers were also passing out food . i was able to taste lots of yummy goodness off their menu they had a `` white '' and `` red sangria '' station set up , so i grabbed a glass of the white sangria and started tasting the food ! their crispy fries with pecorino cheese , garlic , basil and chili flakes were delish ! i probably could have eaten those all night ... i also tried the bruschetta , my fav had to be the apples and brie . they also had some sort of chicken skewers that were a bit bland , and lots of bread to fill up on . they finished the tasting off with these moist and chocolatey brownies ... it was a perfect way to wrap up the tasting . overall this is a great place to have a glass of wine and just relax -lrb- which i did not long ago -rrb- or even a meal with family and friends . i will be back to try some other treats off of their menu very soon !		3		0
this place is good , but nothing incredible . i went here for lunch today and it was busy ! it was difficult to find parking , but i managed to snag a space -lrb- in the lot next door ... shhhh do n't tell ! -rrb- . anyway , it was easy enough to order , although none of their dishes really screamed at me -lrb- most of them sounded ok , but not great -rrb- . at someone 's suggestion , i ordered the chicken roll ups and they were alright . the chicken and the onions were good , but i think maybe the cheese or something in there made them taste just slightly off . anyway , it was good , but i would n't run over there to get it . this place does get points for being fairly inexpensive and quick .		3		0
we 've been here a few times , when we 're jonesin ' for sushi but do n't want to pay an arm and a leg . is it the best sushi in town ? nope . is it decent ? i 'd say so . you ca n't beat $ 1.50 - $ 3 a plate , depending on sushi . the assortment is nice and it lets you try a little bit of everything , from edamame to squid salad to rainbow rolls . our usual fare includes potstickers , edamame , vegas rolls , hawaiian rolls , spicy shrimp and crab rolls and the shrimp tempura rolls . is the fish always perfectly fresh ? no , but then that can be true at any sushi place . the only difference is , with the conveyor belt you can actually see the stuff before grabbing it . if it does n't look right , do n't take a plate . it 's a good place to get a cheap sushi fix , but i 'd recommend going for lunch whenever possible . dinner almost always means a wait , especially on weekends .		3		0
typical `` upscalish morning café '' type place , with your expected menu of breakfast sandwiches and brunch fare . the kickers are three : 1 -rrb- their bakery items rule school ; even the doughnuts are great - you can tell they do n't fry them in sickening soy oil like most places -lrb- owner said they do so in butter -rrb- and the chocolate frosting * gasp * tastes like and is real chocolate ! 2 -rrb- this area , `` arcadia , '' is n't much for such upscale places -lrb- besides maybe the organic eatery , beckett 's table , next door -rrb- so it 's kind of a diamond in the rough if you 're in that dumb place . 3 -rrb- the staff is bad-ass . i say that not in the way of positive thumbs up and smiles all-around , but in the way that they will show their irritation with you at the drop of a hat and respond rudely with no qualms , whatsoever . the owner guy looks pissed constantly , and seems the staff passes their bad treatment on to you . i have to hold back from laughing anytime i go in since they 're so heavy with that stuff . if you 're in the area in the morn ' , hungry , and you do n't want to die from food poisoning by eating bosa doughnuts or the mexican `` food '' that 's nearby -lrb- cerritos , i believe -rrb- , i 'd say give acacia a whirl . just do n't go in there if 'n you 're thin-skinned .		3		0
some of the other reviews of this place are harsh . . `` i did n't get sick '' when that 's the best you can say about a restaurant your in trouble ... wow a restaurant named after a movie how novel ... my big fat greek restaurant ... i would assume have greek food ... what it has greek in the title but no baba ghanoush ? false advertising ... the mucosa was played by vegetarian lasagna and nothing that i expected . wait there is ozo and it was good ... and the pita might be some of the best i 've had . the hummus was pretty good ... baklava on steroids ? with ice cream ? really good ... but not what i was expecting ... mb fgr is to greek food what chilies is to mexican ... if your looking for more authentic greek try crazy jim 's . it was good just americanized greek food ... and at least i did n't get sick .		3		0
let me be the first to pile on casey moore 's with review number 72 ! as a place to go drinking with friends-4 stars . great atmosphere , diverse crowd , good stuff on tap -lrb- my favorite is the four peaks scottish amber -rrb- , great outdoor seating area . for dining they get 3 stars . it has been several months since i left new england and casey moore 's is my first venture out for seafood , albeit with diminished expectations . that being said , my fish & chips -lrb- $ 11.00 , cod , not the haddock overhanging the plate i had grown accustomed to -rrb- was pretty good . the fish was lightly battered and done just right-moist , tender , soft and juicy . the chips were skin - on fries . my wife had salmon oscar . the salmon was slightly overdone , and the crab and hollandaise sauce was a little too fishy . she ordered a double cooked baked potato that looked and tasted exactly like the prefab twice baked potato 's that came with some omaha steaks i received from my boss last christmas . there were also slices of zucchini and yellow squash which were sauteed with mild seasoning . the waitress was outstanding and gave us unbiased recommendations such as : `` i would stay away from the surf & turf . we just do n't go through enough lobster and the kitchen does n't always do a great job with it . it gets sent back sometimes . '' good to know . she also recommended the salt cellar for great fish & chips . overall , i would give them 3 stars and i would return for fish & chips and drinking .		3		0
my first visit was on a rainy afternoon after passing by this place twice , trying to figure out the parking situation and dodging puddles i made it inside ! i 've heard good things about this place so a holiday mixer was a perfect reason to stop in . when i entered i immediately noticed the indoor/outdoor bar area and thought it would be a great place to grab drinks on a sunny afternoon . my party had reserved the upstairs loft portion for our mixer and i was very impressed about how `` urban '' and `` hip '' yet layed back this place felt . since i missed happy hour i ordered a glass of merlot -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- and snacked on their fingerling potatoes -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- ... mmmmm they were delicious and very addicting . since it was raining i opted for the pumpkin soup -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- which was topped with creme fraiche -lrb- fancy word for sour cream -rrb- , croutons and pomegranate seeds . it was creamy , tangy and delish , i almost ordered another bowl . i will def . be back for their jazz brunch or dinner ! overall great service comp valet a bit hard to find if your flying down camelback quality food		3		0
so i get all excited a dutch bros. is opening near me and i rarely ever get here to buy coffee , maybe because my heart now belongs to lola which is virtually up the road . but when i 'm feeling versatile i head to dutch for the kahlua kicker . as always , the staff is insanely nice . it 's almost annoying . maybe i 'm just a curmudgeon . the drinks are a little on the sweet side , when i ask for half the syrup/powder/sweetness i always get asked if i want to make it a quad `` to even out the flavor '' , which is a clever upselling strategy . i always say yes of course . good , dependable coffee . my default coffee choice .		3		0
this place is n't awful but i do n't think it 's worth standing in line for either . i like the cake and the frosting , they are delicious but they 're not `` cravings '' worthy . i had the vanilla hazelnut and you could n't even taste the hazelnut ?? it tastied like whipped milk chocolate which is fantastic if that 's what i wanted . when i hear hazelnut is in a frosting . . i expect more of a nutella flavor explosion . im not saying i would n't return but i would n't go out of my way .		3		0
stacy 's smokehouse is delicious . i tried it today with a friend for lunch . after eating there , i 'm not sure why it is n't completely packed out during lunch . i ordered the bbq beef brisket sandwich , it came double-wrapped and full of juicy deliciousness . you know when you get the best part of the brisket ? a mix of crispy bits and shredded pieces ? it 's that . plus lots of tasty smokey bbq sauce , tucked into a fresh bun . i ordered the large , and it was the perfect size . my friend ordered the small bbq chicken sandwich and was quite pleased with hers . -lrb- for the difference in size , think large costco hamburger bun and the small was more like a mcdonald 's hamburger bun size . -rrb- hers was small chunks of chicken swimming in bbq sauce . as far as the ambiance goes , think of a mix between lo-lo 's and carolina 's .		3		0
okay , came here twice . the young man that always waits our table is always nice , but a bit slow in service . we usually have to get his attention to either get refills or box up food , but he 's incredibly nice . the tom yum goong soup was ordered medium spicy , but came a bit too sour for the hubby 's tastebuds . i do n't think he 's used to having large bits of basil and bamboo in soup , which kinda made him gag . although i like that kind of stuff . my iced water had a bug in it , not exactly appetizing . . the yellow curry was pretty good , but i come to realize something ... do all the thai places in arizona serve/cook curry like this ? it almost seems a bit watered-down and too tangy ... i guess maybe the recipe for curry is different from ca than az ? i think i 'll have to visit house of siam in the bay when i go to visit in a week . not bad , but very strange . hmmm . the pad thai was pretty good , plenty proportions to take home , so i ca n't complain about that ... a bit sour and thin -lrb- thought noodles would be thicker -rrb- , but still good . crab fried rice was moist , tasty , but should not have been $ 13.50 for a plate . i just did n't see what was so special other than it had small bits of crab in it . we should have just gotten beef , chicken or pork fried rice for a fraction of the price . yummy , but a bit much . . i 'm a thai food lover , but i think i 'm going to try some other places before i vote for a favorite .		3		0
i would n't classify this a chinese restaurant . they serve -lrb- like their counterparts in other areas of town -rrb- a feaux-asian cuisine , highly americanized . but i like that cuisine . i just felt this restaurant -lrb- which i 've been to twice , since i could n't believe how whatever the food was the first time i went - but it was just as whatever the second time -rrb- . the service was good , and the outside seating was nicely done . it does n't have the parking issues of it 's tempe location . but from now on , if i 'm in the mood for this cuisine , it 's pei wei or pf changs -lrb- as if that 's not redundant -rrb- .		3		0
this place is pretty cool . we stopped by here really quick on our way out of the mall and decided to grab a drink and a snack . i have been here before but it 's been a few years , so i was excited to try it again . i love the way this place is decorated . it 's all decked out as if you were in the rainforest . huge fish tanks , vines , leaves , trees , bushes , rain , even animatronics animals . it 's quite the place ! we sat at the bar and their barstools are actually formed into different animals , which is a very cool idea . we decided on a few drinks and ended up ordering an appetizer to share . the cheese sticks we had were very good ! nice and crispy on the outside and the cheese was warm and gooey on the inside . the marinara had a lot of kick to it . it 's a really basic dish , but i ca n't tell you how many places i have been to where the cheese sticks are hard , the cheese is n't melted or gooey and marinara taste like watered down tomato soup ! the staff was very friendly ; the atmosphere was really cool , it was a nice place to grab a quick bite ! i ca n't wait to come back and try a main dish and sit back in the restaurant where all the action -lrb- animatronics -rrb- are !		3		0
for a nice looking place with cheerful service and delicious food , i 'm not exactly all in . as others have outlined , the a la carte setup is pricey for what you get . burgers are decent sized and lovely , but they 're not gigantic , and sans sides , i 'd stop well short of calling one `` a meal '' . i 'm hardly a power eater and could 've downed two fairly easily . we had two of their cheapest burgers , fish sandwich , a shake , glass of wine , diet coke and split an order of fries . after tip it was $ 70 , and you kinda ask yourself `` am i really in a burger & shake place , or maybe something pretending to be ? '' example . the menu doesnt list soft drinks , presumably to push the more expensive shakes and wines . of course i got my coke anyway , without a hint of attitude , which was nice . but at a corporate level , something about that rubs me the wrong way . the `` idea '' that ordering a coke at a burger and shake place isnt on , or by implication `` with '' , the program . it 's fox all the way . pretty setting , friendly but inexperienced service , fun menu , generally tasty and overpriced food . sharing plates or cutting expenses at happy hour might make it a more attractive option .		3		0
shopping at aj 's lets me keep shopping local when i need more high-end stuff . i admittedly do n't come here that often , mainly to pick up meat or seafood because their selection is pretty good . they also have a very nice deli section and they have a small but nice selection of wines . until total wine came along , it was the only place i could get my much-coveted south african wine . it 's not practical for me to buy much more here because i can get most things at other arizona business for less but when i need fancy stuff for a dinner party or other special occasions , aj 's is where you 'll find me .		3		0
haus murphy 's is fun place place to go for german meals and it has a lot of fans . i found them to be a little dated with their decor and their food is usually cooked well done or over cooked . their service is a ~ ok . food feedback : apps ~ sausage sampler , bratwurst/krakauerwurst served over a bed of homemade sauerkraut is tasty ! potato cakes , served with a side of apple sauce and sour cream was a bit overcooked very dry . the giant bavarian pretzel imported 10oz . salted pretzel is highly over rated and was not cooked evenly . meals ~ their beef & pork sausages are all served over their homemade sauerkraut with german potato salad or fries . bier bratwurst - beef-pork sausage is good . german bratwurst - pork sausage is bland . krakauer wurst - polish spicy beef-pork sausage is awesome ! their schnitzel 's are good but again overcooked at times . i preferred their steak schnitzel topped with a gorgonzola cheese and roasted onion sauce . served with german fried potatoes and bacon roasted green beans . beers ~ spaten lager or weihenstephan hefeweizen are best , you cant go wrong here .		3		0
as far as chain breakfast spots go , this is n't half bad . i 'd pick it over the good egg for décor alone , which is much less country kitchen and more ... well ... this location looks kind of strange . it 's like walking into an 80s after-school soda fountain shaped like a der wienerschnitzel . the food ? not mind-blowing , but well above average , too . the eggs are cooked just right , and i happen to think the fresh veggies in the omelettes are about as crisp and tasty as you 're going to find . the coffee is on par with denny 's , so take that for what it 's worth . i 'll take this over an ihop any day , that 's for sure .		3		0
3.5 to be fair !!! okay this place is hands down super trendy and romantic and just adorable inside -lrb- i love all the mirrors -rrb- . we had two mishaps without food being undercooked ... they fixed both without giving us any grief and were very nice about the whole situation . our service was great overall and they definitely made up for the food situation . we tried quite a few things - the kale salad is flippen fantastic . i 'm not a huge meat eater so i was happy with the kale salad and brie potatoes we got also . my dear bf is the meat lover out of us and he was disappointed a little with the pork he got but said he would like to go back and try again so it was not alllll the bad . the desserts were sinful and delicious and paired well with some shots of peppermint schnapps : -rrb- i want my star rating to go up so we will give it another go around in the near future ... there is definite potential to be found at the house brasserie .		3		0
took off a star and a half because the novelty of the hand pulled noodle show has worn off and to be honest i do n't think the hand pulled noodles taste any better than store bought dried noodles , or dare i say it , not even as good , and aside from the fresh noodle show i do n't think the dishes here are that good . i 'll just be going back to all my favorites a few miles further north on dobson , or just around the corner at peking palace - oops i mean phoenix palace - peking palace is my favorite in tucson . 2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3 .		3		0
the lunch deal is a good option for $ 10/person since you get a pretty good amount of good food ! i had their cranberry walnut salad -lrb- i think that is what it was -rrb- and it was delicious ! then this last time i got the wedge salad -- the lettuce was limp , some parts were turning brown . no big deal i figures -- boy was i mistaken ... stomach aches for the next three hours here we come ! also , the grilled chicken that we requested on my friend 's salad tasted like processed meat , it was weird , but it tasted like the chicken you get from mcdonald 's . anyway , i would come back for sure , but i think i 'm going to go with the pizza next time , since it seems like you ca n't really go wrong with that option . parking is awful between 1130 and 1230 , so be sure to avoid those times , or just be ready to lurk for a spot for a few extra minutes . the wait staff is really fantastic and they do just about anything to make you happy , even if they seem like they have an attitude , they 're really willing to help out as best they can to make the experience pleasant for you .		3		0
the wife chose postino central for date night . we had been wanting to go to the original for awhile but for whatever reason never made . this was is a little more convenient and we ended up there . we arrived around 5:30 pm -lrb- parked a couple minutes away on colter -rrb- and the place was hoppin ' . surprisingly , the wait was only 25 minutes . we were able to order a couple of drinks and enjoy them over at the mini-stand up tables on the side of the outdoor patio . our wait -lrb- which including the sighting of a local semi-celebrity , so exciting -rrb- did not seem too long , and we were seated . since we had a chance to review the menu while outside , we were able to order quickly once the waitress came by . -lrb- while we were waiting , it seemed like the music was quite loud inside , though i ca n't recall noticing it being a problem once actually inside ... -rrb- . the food was served quite quickly , we each had a salad with a panini . we both enjoyed our salads -lrb- mine was just a side w / the full panini , nice touch with the pine nuts on the greens -rrb- but thought the panini 's were a little weird . it 's just that every time i 've ever had a panini anywhere else , the ` filling ' has been warm . here , the outside had obviously been grilled , but not for too long as my roast beef was still cold . do n't get me wrong , the flavor was still good , but i did n't quite get what i expected . the drinks we had were good , though , i 'd like it better if they extended their wine happy hour so it went past 5pm ... service here was quite attentive and the -lrb- minor -rrb- issue was it seemed like a little bit too long of a wait from the clearing of the table until the check was brought , but it was busy , so not that big of a deal . i give postino on central 3 yelp stars , but in the real world , i 'd give it 3.5 . good service , good tasting food -lrb- though not great execution -rrb- . if i was going to meet someone for a drink in the area and it was before 5pm , i could be persuaded to go back , otherwise , maybe , but probably not .		3		0
now if you like cheese this is the place for you . i almost always order something different and so far my favourite is the seafood relleno . a bit odd with the seafood , but it works . swimming in cheese , luckily its easy enough to push the unwanted cheese to the side . after doing so , i finally get to the pepper itself and all the goodness that it is stuffed with . the salsa is always good and comes with some hotter salsa that you can either mix with the regular or eat with the warm tortilla chips .		3		0
let me clarify , the 3 star rating is only because of the lack of too many vegetarian options . i say this bcs with the kind of food they serve they can easily pull off other good veggie options like their competitors . i was forced to order an appetizer for dinner when i was so hungry , for the lack of options and a side of saffron rice , which was n't as good as say med fresh grill or phoenician cafe ! my friends absolutely loved their meat dishes , but love to c some better veggie options . like the name suggests , i m sure u guys can make tasty veggie kabobs if u can : -rrb- the pistachio ice cream was good . check the photos section for some pics i posted . but the service was good and the owners were very nice to us too , maybe bcs we were in a big group and seems like they felt we were from some review team , hence the extra love -lrb- maybe ? :p -rrb- . they were also keen on splitting the check without much fuss , even though they screwed up a few checks , maybe bcs we were in a big group . one of my biggest pet peeves is when servers come to take away your bowl of food before you are done eating , agreed there were only some tiny scraps in there , but that is always uncalled for . happened here but no biggie . as i said the rating is solely for lack of too many veggie options		3		0
i have mixed feelings on the cheesecake factory . i have come to the conclusion that the cheesecake factory needs to find out what they want to be . do you want to be a mexican restaurant ? a steakhouse ? an american grill ? clearly this mix match of food and seven menu pages worth of choices has worked for them for a long time but my belief is that you ca n't do something great if you try to do 100 things at one time . too many menu items ! while variety is nice , the menu is overwhelming and the chef 's have way too much room for error . my food has always been just okay here but it is clear to me why . i do love the cheesecake . it is my favorite dessert so that is of course ultimately why i come here . i generally decide to make a meal of it when i do come here and often just wonder why i did n't just go to the keg across the street . why have a mediocre steak when you could have an amazing one ? for now i think i will just stick to the cheesecake factory 's namesake . how did a dessert restaurant turn into a free for all of tex mex , steaks , burgers , pasta and seafood , oh my !		3		0
the following of this place kills me ... im from northern california where this place would be average . . but in scottsdale . . its considered the bomb ! okay . . some things i love . . such as the eggs benedict . . its worth the splurge . . but i get the hollandaise sauce -lrb- with a hint of chipolte in the mix -rrb- on the side ... the coffee is strong and i love it ! they carry the sugar in the raw , ` stevia ' . . that rates high with me , even though somewhere in cali that would not be a special thing . . but i love the small things when i get them in az . . ive had their huevos rancheros . . wont do that again . . its not like any ive had before . . so give the chef a ` a ' for going the creative way on the rancheros ! but after a nite at the w. . it made me feel not great . . its overpowered in sauce ... and the tortilla covering the bowl was weird to me . . too much . but again , i give it 3 stars bc for here its a great place to grab any kind of breakfast you want . . challah french toast , pancakes , coffee bar . . and still watch the cutesy scottsdale -- ites . . weekends plan to wait !		3		0
this place is a pretty decent spot on mill avenue . we had just arrived into town for apartment hunting and found ourselves in the tempe area due to its proximity to the airport . the food was actually pretty good for bar food , but i would n't go out of my way to return . it satisfied what we were looking for -lrb- a quick lunch in a laid back atmosphere -rrb- , and i bet it would be really fun with some friends and beers . i have no idea what it 's like at night , though ...		3		0
they know what they are doing with this breakfast thing . i typically get sweet stuff , but on both trips to over easy i ended up ordering the chilaquiles ... i can not resist them . handfuls of tortilla , tons of cheddar cheese , mixed with red chile sauce and succulent chicken , topped with eggs your way . the only thing i find odd about this place 's menu is that they have no avocado ... not on the chilaquiles , not in the omelet ingredients list , nowhere . oh well , i digress ... there is a counter with seating , so you might get lucky and have the option of sitting there , otherwise be prepared to wait 20-40 minutes on a weekend . it 's a fairly small joint , but they get the food out fast and keep the customers moving at a comfy pace . the service has always been good as well . i 've promised myself i will get something sweet next time i go ... we 'll see ! ; -rrb-		3		0
this spot has been previous host to anna 's cafe -lrb- rip -rrb- , byobistro -lrb- rip -rrb- , nix -lrb- rip -rrb- . but finally , i think someone put the right thing in here . a casual , daytime breakfast and lunch spot that caters to a slightly older crowd . we can literally walk here , so we hit it from time-to-time . but it does n't have the same charm or unique menu favorites -lrb- eggs maximillian , parisienne , etc -rrb- that a place like harlow 's in tempe does . you need that to pull people from outside the hood . decor i would call it kitchsy country cafe , but they mean it . so it 's not kitschy . it seriously looks like a midwestern diner , in 1974 . no nonsense . food pretty good . wish it were better . good , hearty breakfast . eggs cooked nicely , as ordered . meats and sides prepared competently . standard , reliable comfort food . it 's straight-up midgrade foodservice stuff . ultimately , frozen shamrock/sysco everything . some things are better than others : the green chile poured over greasy fries is an excellent gutbomb . but the burgers are overcooked - maybe the meat necessitates that . seems like a kickass burger should be a staple at a place like this . i still have some menu exploration to do , so i 'll update . all in all , they seem to be doing well and serving their demographic what they want . i just wish matt 's was across the street instead .		3		0
let 's just start by saying i 'm not a fan of mexican food , but we went here specifically for the chicken fundidos which we had sampled in the fall at the taste of cave creek . they are so delicious ! even more delicious at the restaurant with its mexican ambiance , and its stellar outdoor patio ! a reminder to self , though ... do n't overdo it on the chips ! this place is n't keen on reservations unless you call a couple hours ahead . i called earlier in the day and they told me i 'd have to call back . when i called back two hours beforehand , they said the could n't accommodate a party of 2 until 8 pm . that was too late for us , so we thought we would just try to get in without a reservation , and if not , find another local restaurant . we arrived at 6 pm and there were tables galore -- inside and out !!! i guess they all cancelled ? the service was prompt , but we felt rushed through our meal ... maybe it was because they were expecting another crowd that might not show up ! so with that experience , it knocked a star off what could have been a really 4 star review !		3		0
so this place was one of the many here in downtown that was just super hyped up to me . first - i expected a pizza joint ... not a restaurant . way underdressed , lem me tell ya ! so maybe that just set me up all wrong . i did n't think the pizza was all that great . not the incredible , got ta get it before it 's gone , it 's so worth the long lines -lrb- which there were n't -rrb- . . mumbo jumbo i got . i will definitely go again -lrb- nicely dressed , and prepared for a restaurant -rrb- , and perhaps i will have a better review . but as of now , it gets a 3 . . i like the lack of servers though . i would have been really disappointed if i was all bum-lookin ' and a server offered me a drink ! lol although i can see how that counter could be way over crowded at a busy time of day .		3		0
3.5 stars i am afraid my review is going to sound a bit repetitious of previous yelps , but i figured i should add my two cents . i love oreganos . when i was attending college in tucson , oreganos was just opening up . in fact my roommate and i attended a group interview in an attempt to snag a job , but unfortunately they did not find our request to wear diner outfits and call ourselves dot and myrtle amusing . perhaps we were just too excited to serve pizza . i enjoy the pizza -lrb- i am not above thin crust -rrb- , pasta , and atmosphere - in fact it is my in laws favorite place to go when they are in town . the pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu . the chicken is thin , almost shaved , strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness . the one thing that keeps me from making the drive to oreganos more often is the wait . no reservations , first come first served type of place and despite them having plenty of seating options , and on occasions open tables , i never seem to get out of there with less than a 30-45 minute wait . regardless of the time of day , day of week , season , etc. there is always a wait . once you get past the wait for the table , then you wait a little more for your server , then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours -lrb- depending on how many of us -rrb- and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza . while some people complain that it is a chain , it is a local start chain , which keeps it out of the axis of evil for me . i will continue to return to oreganos on occasion , when i have absolutely no plans to follow my meal .		3		0
i have never had lunch here , only the delicious macarons , so i was driving by on my way home from a meeting around noon and decided to stop in . bad timing . the parking lot was packed and i had to circle around a couple times before i could find a place ... a 15 minute parking spot . so i decided i would just pick up lunch and head home . the place was packed -lrb- which is a good thing ! -rrb- and i waited about 5 minutes in line to order . i ordered the chicken salad sandwich which i figured would be easy and quick . i guess not . i had to wait for another 15 minutes before they brought it out . i dashed out to get to my car and the 15 minutes parking issue ... and when i got home i see a very small hamburger style bun with some chicken salad and a ice cream sized scoop of potato salad . the chicken salad was tasty , but nothing to rave about . wow , disappointed . three stars are really for the great macarons !!!		3		0
overall , this place was unimpressive . get a sandwich next door instead . the food is alright - nothing bad happened here ... but the employees are ... not helpful i guess you would say . when we ordered , the cashier was very clearly untrained and kept pulling other employees to help her with the transaction . instead of a manager or another fully trained employee helping her she kept having to get someone else 's attention to help put in our order and give us change . i paid with cash ... the cash drawer was open ... and i 'm pretty sure that the register tells you how much change to give me . why she needed help counting out change was beyond me .		3		0
where i 'm from we call this hibachi , not teppanyaki . -lrb- mt. fuji i love you ! -rrb- hibachi was always a fun option for a birthday party as a kid and it had been a while since i had gone to one . this was my first experience at a benihana , i 've always gone to locally owned places . i went with a rather large group and although we waited about 25 minutes after our reservation time they were able to give us two tables next to each other . that was probably the best part of the experience . as far as hibachi goes , it was a totally underwhelming experience . the only `` trick '' our chef did was the onion volcano thing and it did n't even fire ! it only steamed ! there was no flipping of shrimp tails , no egg trick , nothing . it was as if we were eating at a regular restaurant . i did n't expect the food to be stellar but i did expect a show , i mean is n't that the whole point ?		3		0
i gave this location only 3 , and not 4 , start because it was so loud my server had to literally yell to talk to us . there were 5 of us at the table and it was difficult to hear each other until about 9pm when half the other tables cleared out ... we were there 2 hrs at that point trying to hold a conversation on a normal level ... it did not happen . not only was it loud with people talking , being a large high ceiling room so the sound carries , but the music was turned up too ... so people probably raised their voices to compete with the music . when the room is packed , turn the music off ! i do n't see going back to this location if it will be this noisy . i just could not enjoy a dinner with friends this way . it felt like being at a sports bar . i usually go to the keg in chandler , and love it - it has none of these issues ... it is all about the building design . chandler = good , tempe = bad .		3		0
got the florentine eggs benedict with tater tots and a side of the 1/2 portion brioche french toast . the tater tots had a different flavour , from whatever oil they were fried in . it was n't bad , but it was a bit weird since it was unexpected . the hollandaise sauce was a bit boring and the english muffin was n't toasted so got a little soggier than i prefer . the eggs and spinach were cooked perfect , however . the french toast was delicious - some of the best tasting i 've had in restaurant - but for $ 4 you get a single slice . for the price of a whole loaf and a half of bread , i expected a bigger portion . it 's a nice breakfast place tucked into a normal shopping centre with a lot of options but i would n't go out of my way to come here again .		3		0
zoe 's is a great place to go to when you dont want to cook dinner and you need something healthy . i went there yesterday after the gym and ordered the chicken kabobs with extra salad . nothing really special about the actual meal , it is just chicken seasoned with some grilled veggies on a bed of salad . one cool thing about this place is that you get a free small drink after 5pm when you order a dinner meal . when i checked in on my iphone i also received a 10 % off my next meal there , so i will go back sometime soon . the girl that helped me was really nice which is always a plus !		3		0
i completely agree with fellow yelper stephanie s. i also went to essence for a sweet tooth fix and was completely disappointed in the dessert/pastry selection . it seemed like the only items were the macaroons . -lrb- yep , i use the english spelling as opposed to the french spelling . -rrb- i decided to go with the tiny sampler box for some variety , but at $ 6.00 i feel as if i was cheated . most of the cookies and pastries were `` meh , i 've experienced better . '' the macaroon -lrb- just one -rrb- was by far the best item , but still not worth the price tag . i also got a lemonade and ginger ale to go . the lemonade was good . not the best lemonade i have ever had , but it did taste better than a lemonade powder mix . the ginger ale is from the grown up soda line ... so it 's a little weak , ginger-flavor-wise . i do have to say that i like the eco-friendliness of essence . i really , really want to support any business that uses eco-friendly products and local produse , recycles , and composts waste . however , i think charging extra for an eco-friendly to go cup is lame . since the biodegradable cup is an extra 50 cents , do i get a 50 cent discount if i bring my own reusable cup ? i understand the economics of charging customers for more expensive -lrb- biodegradable -rrb- products , but a ton of restaurants and shops use those same products with no significant markup to the consumer . whole foods uses biodegradable products , recycles , and composts and they offer a discount to their customers for using reusable grocery bags . this business model works . check out most places in austin , tx . -lrb- sorry , i will get off my soapbox now -rrb- anyway , essences looks really cute , so i will go back to try those great looking salads and eat more macaroons .		3		0
andy is a great guy , find him any day at two hippies , this restaurant is sure to open more as it builds a reputation . $ 5.00 burger , fries and a drink , this can easily equal success above the other thousands of burger locations in phoenix . the menu is to small to have a product like fries that become soggy fast . the restaurant size gives the impression to grab and go . i ca n't wait to give him four starts when the restaurant is in peak performance .		3		0
we visited on saturday night , it was a little early and there were plenty of open tables . really nice atmosphere , a casual upscale feel . we ordered the appetizer special - bacon wrapped scallops -lrb- 4 for $ 10 -rrb- , pear & bleu cheese & walnut salad to share and 2 pizzas -lrb- pizzas come in one size at dinner time - 13 '' - one pizza would be plenty to share for 2 people -rrb- . scallops were tasty if not very inspired . we both liked the salad but had to hunt for the pear -lrb- 3 slices does not make it a feature item -rrb- . dressing was just right . the pizza was so-so - liked the wood-fired crust and nicely cooked . the white pizza was well covered with mozzarella and tomatoes and ricotta but it was just bland - needed some garlic , red pepper or something to jazz it up a bit . same with the pepperoni - maybe it was the sauce ? our bill came to just over $ 50 for appetizer , salad , 2 pizzas and a soft drink . the wine was tempting but at $ 9 a glass we decided to pass and eat instead . overall , i think the cove is worth trying and would go back to try a panini for lunch or happy hour on the patio -lrb- in cooler weather of course -rrb- . one note on our waitress , she was very pleasant although not very attentive -lrb- missed refills on glasses until we pointed it out -rrb- . she spoke in almost a whisper , not a good trait for the profession . maybe there was a secret that we were n't supposed to know ?		3		0
we went here for father 's day brunch - we made a reservation way in advance . we were seated in a table which kept breaking - it was a round table which was actually a square table with an addition on it . seated in a corner which should not even have been a spot . while the service was exceptional , joey was our waiter . the small portions for the brunch seem somewhat strange . everyone loved the prime rib which was huge . the meat is not organic or all natural , even though it is a good cut it still comes from cows which have taken hormones , chemicals and were grain fed . this poses a problem , and the staff at fleming 's was not helpful when i asked them about there lack of meat quality . the service was great , but the meat quality was definitely lacking		3		0
in the zocallo shopping plaza . well , in the tradition of in & out , here we have another burger joint with pretty decent hamburgers , but with a very limited menu . besides the fries , they have hot dogs and 3 sandwiches ; veggie , cheese and veggie , and grilled cheese . so , if you want cole slaw , jalapeno poppers , onion rings , a salad , etc. , with your burger , better look elsewhere . i tried the double bacon burger , $ 6.79 , was n't that big , decent tasting enough though . cajun fries were just ok , nothing special . one plus is that you really can have it `` your way ... '' add any toppings for no additional charge - mayo , lettuce , mustard , ketchup , jalapenos , grilled onions , grilled mushrooms , and more . overall , place is ok , but the limited menu was a bummer for me .		3		0
yes winter is awesome here , personally more wind and rain would be nice . i for one , get tired of sunny days and welcome wintry weather when you can wear cool winter clothes and huddle in some coffee shop or at home . i like to see the dissapointment of the snow birds faces when it rains here , i love that . helps me forget for a few month of how horrible and unreasonable the heat of summer is here and how devoid phoenix is of any real culture . wish people would stop throwing lit cigarette butts out their car windows and more would obey the no burn days and maybe our grey cloud of stagnation might not be so bad . i think smokers who throw cigarette butts out their windows are pig like and should recieve $ 1000 fines by the way . i may start reporting these scuzy freaks .		3		0
honestly , this place is n't anything exceptionally special . i expected it to be a bit more upscale for the arizona center , but it reminded me of your run-of-the-mill mexican places you can find everywhere . now do n't get me wrong , it was delicious for a lunchtime choice and i 'm glad i went because it was tasty but i just would n't go back . for one , the salsa was very chunky . chunky in a way that it was all tomato , cilantro , onions , etc. . but the chips served with were interesting in the fact that they were always hot out of the oven and were long tomale-like shapes rather than poured out of a bag . i got the lunch special # 18 and my friends got # 20 and # 22 . whichever is the chulopa , get that one ! mine was just an enchilada with rice and beans and although it was the cheaper option on the menu , it was n't exciting . i would recommend this place is you 're craving just some basic mexican food and do n't have a long lunch hour . i would also suggest this place for hh . i did n't get to drink but they 're specials looked bomb !		3		0
neat little gem of a place . wait . little is n't the right word . the inside has copious amounts of seating . in addition to the traditional style bar there are high back booths . a perfect retreat as the summer heat wave cooks everyone outside . there is an outdoor patio area which is dog friendly . the seats are n't the most comfortable -lrb- wrought iron -rrb- but will do . the only ding i would give is on the service . maybe it was the time of day we went -lrb- saturday night , 10ish -rrb- but it was really hard to get anyone to serve drinks outside . i say that this is odd as all the guests were outside . there was n't anyone inside ... so . . well . eh .		3		0
here 's what you can eat at jasmine tokyo : 1 -rrb- all kinds of chinese fast food dishes -lrb- chow mein , honey walnut shrimp , crab puffs , etc. ... pretty unhealthy unless you skip the cream cheese-y , fried , and mayo-filled dishes . the sweet chili calamari was worth it , though . -rrb- 2 -rrb- mongolian stir fry . there 's legitimately a tiny ghengis grill-esque section . 3 -rrb- over a dozen kinds of better-than-anticipated-quality sushi , plus sashimi -lrb- not all the rolls were identified , but they were tasty , so who really cares if it was soylent green , anyway ... -rrb- 4 -rrb- something from the shellfish bar ... the crab legs were meaty , but not flavorful ... at least they 're one step ahead of most buffets . 5 -rrb- a smattering of japanese delights , such as the surprisingly impressive squid salad , seaweed salad , etc. . 6 -rrb- meat . there 's a section with huge cuts of red meat for those who are n't ready to venture into americanized asian food , or just need a fat steak to accompany their gyoza . 7 -rrb- dessert - a sundae bar with 6 flavors of ice cream , cakes , puddings , custard , jell-o , fruit , cookies , mousse , macaroons , cream puffs , etc. . the cookies are awesome , especially a la mode , as is the chocolate thunder -lrb- thighs -rrb- cake with banana . in a nutshell : it 's pretty apparent that there are a handful of ways to get your money 's worth , but i 'd say the best bet is just to try everything , then eat approximately 27 pieces of sashimi and 14 rolls of sushi . even if you od on sushi and die of mercury poisoning , at least you were economical about it , right ?		3		0
i went to grimaldi 's for the first time last night with a large party . the service was lackluster . i 'm not sure if our waiter was overworked , having a bad day , or what ... i got there after most of our party and he immediately asked what i wanted to drink . i asked what kind of beer they had on tap and instead of telling me , he pointed at a book on the other end of the table and said the list was inside it . he then said he 'd be right back to take my order . when i opened the drink menu , there was only like 5 or 6 beers on tap so why did i have to go to the other end of the table to get the menu instead of him just telling me what my options were ? then , there is the fact that he did n't come back for over 10 minutes to take my drink order . the pizza . i do n't know what to say about it after reading the glowing reviews of their pizza . i , for one , was n't impressed . we ordered four pizzas and i tried two of them . the cheese on all four did n't appear to be fully melted - it had a cottage cheese-like consistency . the toppings were sparse and small ... the smallest pepperoni i 've ever seen on a pizza ! sauce was good . the crust was decent - it did n't blow me away , but it was good . based on the reviews , maybe it was just a bad night for the waiter and the cook . i 'll try it again , but if the experience is the same , i wo n't be back . 3-1/2 stars .		3		0
charlie 's can be so tragic , but it 's never dull . it 's filthy , and in dire need of some updating . the sound system makes up for it though . . i just wish the music was a dash more cutting edge . the best way to sum up charlie 's = the wal-mart of gay bars . it 's got freaks , weirdos , scary mofos , and then normal people , and all sorts of everything else . there 's truly something for everyone at charlie 's , as long as you can get past some of the barfy elements .		3		0
alex a. and i came here after reading such rave reviews about it on yelp . i must say i was a little disappointed . the restaurant is respectable , but not very large or very nice . it 's been open since the '80s , and i feel like it 's sort of stayed the same since then . but it is clean and owners are very friendly and proud of their establishment . the food was pretty good . i got the chicken katsu curry , and alex got the house special . first thing that struck me was how pricey it was . i 'm guessing that it 's because they do n't have a lot of competition . and i have unrealistic standards because in la there are so many japanese restaurants that you can get a giant bowl of ramen for $ 6 . the chicken katsu was very well made - reminded me of the home-cooked curry my roommate used to make in college . the sides were amazing as well . i really liked the cabbage salad . and the gyoza were fried perfectly . alex 's house special came with such a huge variety of food . there was sashimi , teriyaki beef , edamame , and a big pile of tempura . the sashimi and edamame did n't seem super fresh , but they were still good . the tempura , especially , was good . they had tempura asparagus , which i had never had before . i do n't think i 'd be coming back , though . the food was okay , but the prices were a little high for what it was .		3		0
visited this establishment over a year ago and also returned yesterday . foodwise , the shepherd 's pie was not too great as it was poorly assembled and this is n't really a real irish pub anyway . chicken quesadilla appetizer had a few good bites and happy hour has only a handful of $ 5 food specials , more focusing on the alcohol . yesterday , i enjoyed a large 20oz beer for about $ 3.50 and sat on the nearly empty patio at prime time happy hour around 5:30 pm . inside was full of men everywhere watching golf and basically a man overload . you can only stare at the tilted kilt girls so long - so the novelty wears off after awhile . these girls seem less friendly here in tempe , but they were all mostly gorgeous so the positives outweigh the negatives . oh and join the email club and get a free order of irish nachos .		3		0
not awful , but certainly not that good . after 4-5 visits , i only go there in a pinch , or when i 'm asked to meet others there . i wish it were better , because it 's so close . the good : decent craft beer selection , terrific service , great location , patio dining . the bad : underportioned for the price -lrb- sides/fries are much bigger at delux -rrb- , quality -lrb- burgers are n't as good or as imaginative as at the grind -rrb- . i 'm happy to drop $ 15 for a big , awesome burger and a big order of really well done fries . but zinburger does n't deliver that . went again last night for a get-together and tried the asian chicken salad -- small portion for $ 10 or $ 11 and totally unmemorable . had a nice four peaks ale and sierra nevada , though .		3		0
i was watching a judge judy show today and jj was really giving the business to this loser -lrb- you know ... had bad credit , met a chick , she took a credit card in her name , he did n't pay her back , she 's shocked , now they 're in court -rrb- ... she was riding his ass . it was awesome . finally she said `` what planet are you from ? '' ... dude with mullet bows his head , darts his eyes from jj and says `` why , i 'm from wisconsin judge judy '' . lmao ! culver 's , by way of the dairy state , has settled on camelback and central . rickie and i ate here after seeing date night on our `` date night '' . thought it was a cute , innocent , 1950s way to wrap up our afternoon . you know , kinda like richie and laurie beth . please , i need to check id 's on this reference . i 'm sure rickie would n't pass this one ! culver 's was very clean with well trained and polite employees ... think in n out . we ordered the famous butter burgers along with various sides . burgers . yum ! sides . ugh ! would rather have had ore ida . cheese curds had a thick , icky overcooked batter with a q tip sized cheese curd , fries were limp and sad -lrb- kind of like jesse james career and life now -rrb- and the chicken tenders were standard fast food fare . root beer ! outstanding ! smoothie was ok ... probably should have went with a good old fashion malt . but who knew ? we had a fabulous booth across from a large open window with a fantastic sunday breeze cooling our curds . i would go back for a burger and root beer . i might even wear a packers or brewers t shirt ... just to see if i get some free stuff .		3		0
decent food , loud atmosphere -lrb- but its a brewery so expected -rrb- , slow service . all in all ok , but not stunning . i ordered the shrimp carbonara , it was meh at best . not enough salt and i expected at least some seasoning . i did n't even bother trying the bread that came with it , my husband did and was not impressed . we also had the beer sampler , this was good . kilt lifter by far is one of my favorites here . the peach ale was good too . now lets discuss service : we had to ask 2 separate people to get a high chair , and drink refills were like pulling teeth . i really had high hopes for this location as the one in tempe was great the last time i was there . sincerely disappointing and the atmosphere is not relaxing .		3		0
alright ... this is a chain ... so you get what you think you are gon na get . they were only about 30 or 40 percent full on the sunday afternoon we went there . our waitress had too many tables ... inside where we were and outside . so she was running her patootie off ... and seemed very hurried . i blame management for overstreching her . huge gaps between her visits . some more bus boys to keep the drinks fresh and troubleshoot would have helped alot . the food was good . i had a burger that was tasty and perfect fries . the ale was super . lots of drinks to choose from . ambience . if you are into sports there are tons of tvs and blaring sports sounds . not my cup of tea ... but then again ... the waitresses give you plenty of ... shall we say ... other things to look at besides the lame sports offerings .		3		0
scramble has a really cute layout and color scheme like all the other breakfast joints : very clean and hip i had the impression that it was a sit down restaurant but it 's an order and seat yourself sort of deal ... it got a little bit packed and was kinda hard to find a seat but we managed to find one ... i got a coffee , the breakfast blend ... and the costa breakfast burrito which came with potatoes the burrito itself was really good and flavorful i did n't like the potatoes , so i just let them sit there the service was a little slow but not a big deal at all , i 'm very patient and i saw how busy it was all of the girls working were very friendly and cute it was a good first experience and maybe next time i will try the breakfast pizza		3		0
arrived around 5pm one wednesday evening . the place is not in a nice area of phoenix , and it looked deserted , and i was going to leave , when i saw a mercedes and lexus pull up . so i thought i 'd give it a chance . the prices were somewhat reasonable , i got the lo-lo 's for $ 11 -lrb- 2 waffles , and 3 pieces of fried chicken -rrb- . the food was tasty for what it was , but i only give it 3 * 's because its just so unhealthy . . kool-aid , waffles , syrup , and fried chicken ! this is the kinda a place i may go once a year , but i just feel so guilty ! not sure what the syrup was , but it certainly was n't real maple syrup -lrb- i 'd imagine it is some sugar based creation -rrb- , and the waffles were dry . the chicken was n't very moist , it was also a bit on the dry side .		3		0
to put it succinctly , the service at mijana bordered on the comically absurd . before weaving this narrative , i will disclaim that it blows my mind that after years of being in business -lrb- and countless reviews attesting to the sub-par service -rrb- that there has been little to no improvement in that department . our party arrived for `` international night '' at 7p on a sunday night . -lrb- the second sunday of each month this restaurant hosts a few performers/acts from varying parts of the world . tonight we got to enjoy brazilian samba , egyptian bellydance , and spanish flamenco . the entertainment was wonderful ! upon our arrival , the restaurant was less than half empty . i noticed three servers and the manager/owner in attendance . as we were seated we immediately asked for a high chair for our toddler . that high chair arrived about an hour and a half later . it probably took 15 minutes before we received menus . no drink orders were taken , no waters brought to the table -lrb- they arrived about a half hour later -rrb- . we had been seated for about twenty minutes before i flagged down a server and asked if we could order . her reply was , `` she has not come , yet ? '' and took off to find our server . when our gal arrived , there were no apologies or explanations . we pre-empted our order with the disclaimer that we were all very hungry and wanted to order right away . so our orders were finally placed after we had been at the restaurant for nearly thirty minutes . the beer i ordered never arrived , but i had to get up and let the server know once my third appetizer plate came to the table . no apologies . i ordered seven hot appetizers . the first three arrived about thirty minutes after they were ordered . the quail , fatayer , and foul moudamas . quail -lrb- sautéed over hummus -rrb- : perfect portion for one person , absolutely flavorful and delicious . crisp and spicy/sweet on the outside , juicy and flavorful on the inside . fatayer -lrb- four spinach pies with onions , sumac , and line nuts -rrb- : nothing to rave about , basically a lackluster version of spanakopita without the feta . foul moudamas -lrb- fava beans cooked with garlic and lemon juice , topped fresh diced tomatoes , cilantro with drizzle of olive oil -rrb- : loved this , fresh and packed with flavor . i had to get up and get more bread for our dips , as server was nowhere to be seen . i had to constantly clear the table of plates as no one came to the table to do so . at one point , about an hour and fifteen minutes after we arrived , the owner came to the table to ask how the food was -lrb- the music was so loud i was virtually screaming at him and i barely heard him -rrb- . i handed him a stack of plates that i was just clearing from the table and mentioned how the food tasted great , but we were all still hungry ... hint hint . the server never came to follow up on our food , to ask if we wanted refills , or just to see how everyone was doing . around 8:30 p , one hour after our orders were placed , i had to once again get up and find the server to ask about the remaining dishes i ordered . at that time she informed me that they were out of two of the appetizers i ordered . no sambusek , no makanek . no apologies . fine , but the appropriate thing to do would have been to come to the table and inform us about this , and offer something else instead . long story short , she mentioned that my chicken shawarma hummus was on its way , more than an hour after i ordered it . the final appetizer i ordered , would arrive an hour and fifteen minutes after order was placed . hummus shawarma -lrb- chicken over hummus with pine nuts -rrb- my favorite dish of the night , tasted exactly like pita jungle 's version -lrb- just costs more -rrb- . the chicken was outstanding . soft , succulent , and savory . garlic shrimp -lrb- sautéed shrimp in garlic cilantro -rrb- second favorite dish . generous portion of gorgeously plump prawns , well seasoned and very flavorsome . we snickered collectively when the hostess of the evening announced that the entertainment was coming to a close , and that there would be samba lessons . i quote , `` i hope that your food has settled so you can enjoy some dancing lessons . '' everyone 's entrees literally arrived an hour after we had come to the restaurant , right when the hostess opened up the dance floor for some lessons . the music was so loud that i had to stuff mine and baby 's ears with tissue - we were literally yelling in each other 's ears so we could hear one another . our sweet baby had an amazing time , though ! she loved the music and the dancers and was captivated the entire time . we were so lucky to have the entertainment to keep our minds off our growling -lrb- roaring -rrb- bellies . our bill arrived close to 9p , after i once again made the journey to find our server and request the bill . no thank you 's , no smiles , no apologies from her . however , i would love to return for future international nights . i will likely sit at the bar with no expectations of food or service - maybe a cocktail and some shisha .		3		0
my first thai e-san experience was just funny . shortly after they opened , i went in for take-out . there were all these menu possibilities -lrb- e.g. , fish in noodles , etc. . . -rrb- that i had never seen before . so , adventurous me decides : must order . well , this inspires lots of interesting looks ... and finally -lrb- ions later -rrb- the food comes out and they say `` well , we never really made that dish with fish ... it might not be good ... if not , return it ... '' -lrb- no , they did n't think to say something before they prepared the food ... -rrb- i go home and find myself separating the fish from the rest of the dish and eating the two dishes . so , after that ... long thai e-san haitis ... find myself back there . this time i ordered pad thai , figuring that they must have prepared pad thai . the wait was shorter . the pad thai came and the first thing that i realized was holding the pad thai package was like weightlifting ... yes , there was just that much food ! the food was good . it was fresh . but , seriously , it could feed a military . the military of a small country , but a military . my big complaint -lrb- after the fact that their portions are huge -rrb- was a massive lack of heat . next time i will ask for uber-spicy ...		3		0
i love art so i was excited to go check this place out , and it just was not what i expected . do n't get me wrong , i can appreciate the art that is there , but i was just expecting a `` museum '' and when i think of museum i think of a big place with lots to see . not the case here . it is very small , what they do have is great but just wish there was more . it 's really cheap ... two people for $ 10 . the day we went there was a wall of ribbons with wishes on them . . you pick one and wrap it around your wrist and fill the hole you took it from with your written wish . they saw when it falls of your wish will come true . -lrb- i 'm a sucker for cute little things like this -rrb- check it out if you 're in the area and can spare a few minutes for a quick walk through .		3		0
clever koi is like the 1st luxury car i purchased . sexy , stylish , desirable & i was excited to own it . but after the novelty wore off i realized that it was n't quite as special as i thought it was . i gave clever koi 4 stars on my 1st review , they got that because overall the food was pretty good , but the atmosphere and presentation bumped it a star . considering you ca n't give a 3.5 stars i gave it a 4 , partially because i think the place is really cool and i want it to succeed , but after 4 visits , -lrb- i 'm currently the duke of this establishment as you might see -rrb- i 'm making an update based on subsequent visits . let me address the food , every time it has been plated and presented so artfully , and you can tell that the menu and dishes were meticulously planned . the problem is the execution . like tonight for example , i ordered the chicken fried turkey wing , and it looked delectable , but delectable it was not . it was dry , so dry it would have been inedible had it not been for the house sriracha sauce i requested . my friend had the pork ramen , he stated that the broth tasted like pure soy sauce and he was not satisfied with it . on a prior visit , i also had the one of the steamed buns with some sort of pork . the pork was quite chewy and the greens that were inside the bun had a strong vinegar flavor , it just was n't good . i wo n't carry on about every imperfection but i 'm adjusting my rating to a 3 because after extensive exploration of the menu the food just does not live up to a 4 star rating . tonight mgmnt certainly made a more than adequate effort to save my experience , and i greatly appreciate them covering our bill . however , i feel the responsibility to the yelp community to share honest feedback and after 4 visits it was necessary to update my review to reflect what i have experienced . i still think it 's an innovative , and unique place and will continue to come for drinks , but overall the food has been average at best and they maintain a 3 from me because of the location , creativity , presentation , and the atmosphere .		3		0
it 's a modern strip mall . not very big , but with a few decent restaurants -lrb- by valley standards , not for visitors -rrb- . it feels like they tried to trend it towards professional 20-30somethings rather than families , but they fell flat . everything here is a chain . that 's not an indictment of chains in general , but it creates an experience without any personality . it feels overdone . on the plus side , there 's really nothing else there . it 's better than nothing .		3		0
we decided to head over to the trendy new pink taco in scottsdale to check it out this weekend . i must admit that the decor is pretty creative and tacky but in a good way ... i think . it is definitely visually stimulating . the salsas , especially the green salsa , were good . however , they try to make a chip different and it did not work . the chips are very thick and almost taste burnt . why change a good staple ? just to be trendy and different , i suppose . that works sometimes but not here . the food is alright , but nothing special . i preferred the enchiladas over the burrito , and the chicken over the carnitas . the key to this restaurant is atmosphere and good drinks . i do n't think they hook you by serving stellar food . so , enjoy a prickley pear margarita and you should be on your way to having a good time .		3		0
we got a piper down ! by the rue for lunch today was the tilted kilt , i arrived in a car and not on stilts , this is not the house that peter built , when i play pinball i never tilt ! my opinion it 's a two star `` pub '' , a lot of t.v. 's and mediocre grub , take a shower or get in the tub , maybe the girls will give you a chub . went with the blackened chicken flatbread , lettuce , tomato , onion , chipotle spread , right after i ordered i thought in my head , i should have went with cheesesteak instead . it looked good right when it came out , after the first bite i wanted to shout , `` where is the chicken '' i should have spout , but i sucked it up anyway , and i hate no doubt . it 's funny to see all the negative reviews , from all the guys who do n't have a clue , do n't get mad when the chicks are n't into you , go home and pout when you finish your brew . the ice tea was rich and strong how i like , snoop dogg called e-z-e 's mom a frisco dyke , if you 're a stickler for food then you might dislike , the choices here but no reason to strike . it 's a much better place to watch the game , do n't even bother asking your waitress her name , they get it all day long you 're just the same , another tool in a used bmw , what a shame . courtney our waitress was right in stride , efficient and cute and certainly not wide , to the girl with the huge tattoos down your side , i would marry you tomorrow and make you my bride !! haggis !!!		3		0
one of our long-time employees was leaving the company -lrb- after about 15 years -rrb- so a decent-sized group of us came to fez for a send-off lunch yesterday . i myself had suggested it to the event decision-maker , but had never been before - i just know that it 's had a lot of good reviews , the pics of the menu items on yelp looked tasty and it 's only a few blocks from where i work . tl ; dr : i was n't impressed . details as follows : most of my coworkers would n't know flavour if it kicked them in the face , so out of about 14 people , quite predictably the all american burger was the most popular choice . might as well have all gone to jack in the box instead and saved 50 % , but whatever . i decided to grab a large basket of garlic and rosemary fries to share with the three at my end of the table , and -lrb- unusually for me -rrb- chose a salad as an entree . i selected the barcelona butterleaf salad . the fries were pretty good , nothing mindblowing , but the salad was below par . i was n't after anything fancy , but the nuts were not candied like shown on the menu , they were just plain cashews - and the salad was absolutely fucking drenched in the dressing . as in , so much that the lettuce was wilted and i was wincing with each mouthful toward the end because of the extreme vinegary zing . they could have gotten away with a quarter of the amount they put on . i thought that some pickled beet might be nice on the salad and asked if that was an ingredient they could provide . nope . i asked a workmate what he thought of his blue cheese burger . he had asked them for a couple of pepperoncinis - again , nada . they offered him chili pepper flakes instead . basically he told me that it was okay but the meat lacked flavour . nobody at our table seemed particularly overjoyed . as for me , i do n't think i 'd want to eat a burger with ciabatta bread . how about a sesame seed bun instead ? too traditional - for an all american burger ? evidently . this is yet another place that imposes a mandatory tip for large parties - that tip , of course , is your penalty for bringing more clientele into the establishment and forcing the restaurant to make just that much more money . because it sure was n't to ensure that all meals were served at the same time to the guests . one of our guys had to wait several minutes for his burger to come out . three stars , and i probably wo n't be back - not as long as there are places like pho thanh in the vicinity where you can get double the taste and double the amount of chow for half the price . not for a place with this level of mediocrity . seventeen bucks for a shit salad and about ten fries - god i wish pork on a fork , greek wraps and indian paradise were n't 20 min drives away .		3		0
i really wanted to like the improv more than i did . when i found out one of my bf 's favorite comedians , patton oswalt , was coming , i bought tickets about three months in advance . i used the improv web site , and would like to note that it was relatively painless and easy to navigate -lrb- though could use a design update and less `` clutter '' -rrb- . so , we show up early to pick up our tickets and stake a good spot in line to get a decent table -lrb- first come first seated , it said on the web site -rrb- here 's where i get really annoyed - there 's a guy at the bottom of the stairs that take you up to the venue who gives you your tickets , which have already got a number on them - our table number he says . i do n't know how many different ways i asked him why there was a line of people out front and why we did n't have to wait in it if we did as he instructed , but i never got a clear answer . so , we head up the stairs and past about 35 people in line and head in a door , to a small mini `` club '' with a guy standing at a rolling cart of booze . the bartender informs us that we can hang out in here instead of wait in line outside if we buy at least one drink . furthermore , we will be seated first -lrb- though why that makes a difference since our envelop with our tickets had a table number on it , i do n't know ... it was all very confusing - esp . because the web site says first come , first seated -rrb- but it 's cold and we do n't want to wait in line outside so we abide and grab the last table in the mini lounge which is playing old reruns of in living color . they start filing us into the main venue and the layout is just ok . i would almost argue that there is n't a `` good '' seat in the house . all the tables faced the exact wrong way , so no matter where you sat , you had to swivel away -lrb- it 's too tight to actually turn you chair -rrb- from where your drink and table is . some tables were just downright ridiculous , shoved all the way in a corner , practically behind the stage . at least the drinks were reasonable - well , $ 5 for a bottle of bug light . but you could drink for cheap if you wanted to . i will say that the service was great . the waiters were really cool , really fast and really efficient given they 're mostly working in the dark and whispering . the `` warm up '' guy was actually pretty funny , and the opening guy was even better . no hecklers or issues to speak of . after the show , they open these back doors that go right out to the parking lot for an easy escape ... except after four beers i really had to go to the bathroom . big fat boo to the girls ' bathroom having two stalls ! it 's like after a movie . i seriously considered peeing in the parking lot , but i stuck it out . so all in all , it was n't * bad * but it was n't amazing . the décor and tables and chairs were really cheap . i guess i expected more of an experience from a renowned comedy club .		3		0
i am not a hipster ... or a fan of the mod style so i did n't really like the ambiance here as much as some of the other reviewers . they have a nice patio , though . the food was pretty good , too . as others have remarked , it is not exactly traditional mexican but i do n't mind places that put their own spin on things . i had the pozole which was very tasty . my hubby and i often debate with family and friends from mexico as to whether pozole broth should be red or clear - everyone seems to have their own opinion of which way is right . i was happy that at gallo blanco they had a clear broth but served it with a chile paste that you could add to your taste and so make it as red as you want . our queso fundido appetizer -lrb- with chorizo -rrb- was just as tasty and the special key lime dessert was d-lish as well . the biggest disappointment was the menu . i was surprised at how limited it was . i would not recommend this place for dinner . but i am sure the tacos would be great for happy hour . and i would love to come for brunch to try some of the breakfast items . i noticed they had micheladas on the drink menu and so that would work nicely for either occassion . so , three stars for now but it may increase in the future after subsequent visits .		3		0
you can hear your arteries clogging as soon as you sit down but this place is decent especially considering the location -lrb- mmm van buren red light district -rrb- . wild west atmosphere and hay on the floor , the waitresses carry 6-shooters and you can hear the spurs clicking around . their breakfast is everything you 'd expect from a greasy spoon and for dinner their pulled pork is decent . the portions are huge and ive been there many times and never had an issue with the staff . usually its an elderly person w / a friendly demeanor . you can find better but this place has history that adds to the appeal .		3		0
i 've never really been comfortable hanging out at the bars in scottsdale . too much plastic , with respect to both the gigando chesticles and maxed out credit cards . but there are a couple of gems that manage to retain their individuality despite botox 's best attempts at smoothing out these `` wrinkles '' in the `` scene . '' the coach house is definitely one of them . by scottsdale standards , this is a divey joint . by my standards , i was home . i went here for happy hour and made the mistake of asking , `` what kind of specials do you have ? '' one confuddled look from the bartender and a little smirk later , `` we do n't have any happy hour specials , '' translated to `` everything 's on special . all day , every day . '' $ 3.25 well , cheap ass pitchers , and a strong pour . my bourbon and diet was more like rocks with a splash of soda . no carbonation to be found . now that 's a damn fine way to pour a drink . the ambiance of this bar is pretty rad too , with an old rickety picket fence surrounding the wrap around patio bar with plenty of misters that managed to keep us cool even in 100 + heat . the exposed and weathered wood inside added to the historic feel and they were playing some awesome old school jazz while we were there , instead of the expected country music . clientele ranges from business casual , just stopping by for a drink after work , to what can only be referred to as salty dogs , despite the fact that they 're not mariners and arizona has no beach front property . we 'll call them the urban salty dogs . i had the pleasure of chatting with one of these gems as he single handedly pounded his pitcher and was talking about music in what i can only assume was english . it 's was hard to keep up with the disjointed thoughts and heavy slur . still , it beats condescending looks from the plastic people any day of the week !		3		0
i live in west phoenix , and do n't get out to this particular area often , but i 've been teaching a class nearby , so i 'm taking advantage of the opportunity to try some local spots . i was happy with the blue adobe . i ordered a tenderloin ceasar wrap , and it was quite good . the tortillas are great . the wrap made a great lunch . i was surprised by a side of frys . they were decent , but did n't make sense with the main course . the food was good , the staff friendly and courteous . a little expensive for lunch - expect to spend about $ 10-15 per person .		3		0
this is a great place to people watch if you can get through the door . kelly 's started off as a quiet bar in old town and now you must wait in line . i have to admit the drinks at the this place are great . the moscow mules and arizona mules are delicious . do n't walk away with the silver or cooper mug , they will charge you . the food and drinks prices are reasonable . i love the lounge-feel of kelly 's . they have tons of indoor and outdoor seating . if darts are your game , check out the back room . i have only been here for drinks but i 'll to visit to check out their food menu .		3		0
went their for a team-building breakfast the other day . it 's been a little while since i set foot in here . as far as a breakfast/brunchery place , it 'll probably hit the spot for most people . they have decent portions , decent prices and a vast selection of menu items . there is just a few things i would like to see homemade . their corn beef hash is straight out of a can , their country gravy is straight out of a bag . if i remember correctly it 's mixed with 3 qts . cold water , then added to 1 qt boiling water , and shazaam ! you have instant country gravy -lrb- i 'd like to thank my first cooking job at flying j for leaving that bit of knowledge in my head . -rrb- any way , the service is pretty good . we were there on a weekday , so business was n't that bad . but i remember coming here on a saturday years ago and the poor staff just got pummeled . so i give this place an average rating with food that will please most . they seem to be in business for quantity over quality .		3		0
i was n't blown away by this place . it 's another `` trendy '' restaurant in scottsdale quarter that has the feel of a fox restaurant . the menu is small and not very descriptive . the food is not anything out of the ordinary . i 'd describe it as interesting but not delicious . i ordered the roasted chicken because my waitress said it would be `` half a chicken , '' so i assumed that there would be breast meat . nope . a measly thigh and drumstick . baby spinach saturated in sodium . runny polenta . everything appeared very creative , but tasted less than impressive . what a disappointment . there seemed to be confusion among the waitstaff ; several appetizers were presented to our table that we did not order ... i wonder how much this affects tk 's profit margin ... they certainly make up for it with the frugal portion size . it 's not a place that i 'll seek out again .		3		0
you know , i 'm going to keep this simple . if you 're looking for a good selection of beer on draft , go here . if you 're looking for beer and food , look for other options . came here at lunch time with some co-workers and was n't impressed by the limited menu , at all . food was decent but i have experienced much much better food from other breweries . the octoberfest that was on draft , was fantastic . because of that i will give 3 stars , though i would love a 2.5 star option .		3		0
me and my boyfriend came here for lunch . there were n't a lot of people there but that still did n't help with the service . it took a substantial amount of time for us to get our food which was ok . he had the jalapeno burger and i had a shrimp po ' boy and they both came on ciabatta bread , which made it a little difficult to enjoy the shrimp which was n't as crispy as i liked . the music was nice and mellow while we were eating lunch . it took forever for our waitress to bring the check so i had to get it from the bartender and then after waiting for 10 minutes she finally came back with the receipts . overall , it was an ok place . nothing much to brag about but then again they 're known for their drinks and not their food for a reason .		3		0
i thought i had reviewed cibo before , but today i went to check back on what i wrote and apparently i never did . so here goes ! it 's always been one of my favorite spots . the patio is incredibly cool , and a great place for a date , inside is no less cool and is awesome in decor . all the old bedrooms making the dining rooms is awesome . antipasta is great , and pizza has always been great . i do take out here a lot and never mind eating inside either . last night though , was my first visit in months , and it is just not the same . the pizza was overly doughy , and lacked that crisp wood fired taste and texture . the sauce was n't the same , as it tasted very bitter in comparison to prior visits . i ordered the salsicca and what used to seem like a high quality pizza , no longer did . the sausage was some sort of ground meat like substance , compared to what i remember being a high quality sliced sausage . their wine list has changed since my last visit , and now only has one cabernet ... a rather shitty one at that . my friend had a white pizza that she enjoyed , though my observations about it were mostly the same as though it had gone downhill . i ca n't tear into the place though , as the atmosphere is too perfect . service is spectacular as well , and though i 'm bitching about the pizza , it 's still great pizza . it 's just not what i remember ... maybe i 've been eating metro and bianco too much lately .		3		0
i thought i 'd reviewed this place before . guess not . first of all , ra is loud as hell . if you want to go somewhere for a quiet , relaxing lunch or dinner , this is not the place . you will find yourself speaking loudly over the live music -lrb- which on monday nights is very good by the way -rrb- or music they play over the system . second of all , i would only ever come here during happy hour . partially because i 'm not really a fan of sushi , and secondly because i do n't like to pay a lot for things i 'm not really a fan of . tonight i spent $ 10 on chicken teriyaki , a california roll , and a tsunami punch . great . it was good and i could n't complain . i am by no means a sushi expert , but a few of my friends that have tried a few different places seem to like it here . the drinks are bomb . on my first visit i had the mango margarita . tonight i had the baby tsunami punch and a taste of my friend 's sake sangria . i ca n't vouch for how much alcohol is in them because they are so tasty , but for $ 4 i ca n't complain .		3		0
ok , so here 's the skinny on skeptical chymist . i work near this hidden gem , and also attend weekly trivia , so i 've experience both day and night outings on a regular basis here . the service is something to be desired . there always seems to be an ever changing staff of waitresses , one after the next seem indifferent to prompt service after the intial , `` what 'd you like for drink ? '' do n't get me wrong , there are a few waiters/waitresses that have been there for a while and they 're awesome ... but there 's more than a handful that need to either shape up or shove off . the food - there 's pretty much nothing bad on the menu here . mussels - amazing , and the broth is even tastier than the mussels themselves ! rasher burger - i 'd get it every time if my doctor allowed me to . flatbreads - not too much here , if you 're hungry , do n't waste your money on these . steak salad - my personal favorite , though after they recently raised the prices , it 's a little hard to stomach a $ 14 salad . also , do n't get soda or mixed drinks here ... it tastes funky and the owners know about it . they 've been `` working on it '' for nearly three years now .		3		0
it was beautifully decorated , but i really wish the food had been a lot hotter . my friend and i were starving , but l have issues with food being tepid . i 'm surprised that the indians we saw there would actually stand for it - the indians back in india had no problems with returning food if it was n't piping hot ... which is how i like my food . the naan was n't bad , but it was n't the best i 've had , either . today 's features offered some lovely eggplant -lrb- * purrs with happiness * -rrb- and good vegetarian dishes as well . i had their chicken curry , but it was the veggie dishes that did it for me . i 'd like to take hubby to this place to gauge his reaction . bonus ? the food was n't salty and i did n't guzzle 2 gallons of water an hour after having eaten there . for now , 3 stars .		3		0
this was my second try at ethiopian food in a week . was n't quite as impressed with the dining experience as many though still a great place if you are ever wanting to at least try ethiopian for your first time . i ordered the ethnic stout and my partner in crime had the tea . the stout was a few hops away from being an ipa , a little too much for me but the tea was very delicious after it cooled down from its molten plasma form to a more drinkable liquid . we ordered the spicy combination along with the goat selection and brown lentils . i 'm a spicaholic and the berbere definitely gave each of the dishes a nice kick . the beef dish was cubed just right for picking up in bite sized morsels but the chicken needed to get handled with with hands to tear pieces away . the injera was really sticky and not quite dried out yet which is where the problems were later in the meal . after you get about halfway through your meal by scooping it up with the injera provided in the basket the rest is usually able to be eaten with the layer of injera below your food selections . because it was already so moist the moisture from the food completely disintegrated the injera as i tried to pick it up . i had to order another basket of fresh injera in order to clean up the plate . in conclusion , great food but i definitely recommend ordering a second helping of injera right off the bat if you are ordering a platter for two or more people .		3		0
i think i came here on a bad night . i really dug the decor & the more than ample wine list -lrb- of which i had a nice shiraz and my date had a nice cab -rrb- . from all angles , between the lounge area and the quiet dining tables , it 's a really cool , quiet little place to take someone out . we were promptly seated and took a few minutes to ponder the wine , which came out promptly , followed by some tasty bread , followed by ordering , followed by an extended conversation ... hey ... my wine is just about ... empty ... and ... i still do n't have food ? the waitress comes over & explains there 's been a mixup in the kitchen , and that the food is on the house . holy crap , it 's been an hour since we sat down ? good thing this was n't an awkward first date . the food , also , was kinda lukewarm & not that great . i had the steak -lrb- which comes out crusted with a peppercorn crusty thing and pre-sliced , which was a bit odd -rrb- . i think i 'll have to give this place another shot .		3		0
we ended up here one night as dessert refugees after a hugely disappointing meal at vincent 's on camelback . they were booked for the night but found us a table on the patio so we could enjoy at least one tasty morsel in our evening . the tarts were fabulous , the owner who seated us was extremely accommodating and we were determined to come back . last night , we had dinner there . it was a pleasant enough experience but i did n't it find it worth the cost -lrb- and we had a groupon ! -rrb- . i did not find the portions to be tiny as another reviewer said . my filet was tasty enough but sadly , i had a better cooked filet earlier in the week at charleston 's for about $ 10 less . my key lime tart was delicious but it was about 80 % crust and 20 % filling -lrb- i 'm more of a filling girl than a crust girl -rrb- . my companions ordered the peanut butter mousse dessert and it was very tasty . it would have been extra tasty with a wee bit more salt . it 's definitely a cute venue although i do n't understand the distinctions about being a great `` date night '' place because it is quite small and privacy is limited . it was a nice enough place but definitely did n't `` wow '' me .		3		0
i 'm giving five stars for the awesome food and the sangria . if you go during happy hour you can get some great nachos or calamari . $ 12 pitchers of sangria on sunday are awesome , but prepared to get your ass kicked if you kill too many pitchers . the bar area and patio are really nice as well . where this place loses points is the attitude of some of their bartenders . some are nice but some have their noses so high in the air it 's amazing that there 's air to breathe at that altitude .		3		0
sugar high ... got ta have it really need sugar high ... oh sorry . ok . so now i 've eaten a sprinkles cupcake which i guess is supposed to be a status symbol in the scottsdale world . honestly , i do n't see the big deal . it 's a very high priced cupcake that did n't really knock my socks off like i had hoped it would . i had the peanut butter chocolate cupcake . the peanut butter was very subtle as it seemed overwhelmed by the amount of sugary chocolate in the frosting . the cupcake itself was moist and yummy , but very messy at the same time . brought 2 home for my family . hubby had the black and white cupcake and said all he could think of while eating his was wilford brimley 's diabetes commercials . my 8 year said his milk chocolate cupcake was good but crumbly and was too chocolatey ... is that possible ? apparently so because he 's a real choco-holic . the store is very clean , but small considering the clientle was lined up all the way out the door . the staff was very friendly , helpful , and nice . i 'd go to sprinkles again but it wo n't be something that i make a real effort to pursue . one cupcake was truly enough .		3		0
i had a pretty good time at bar smith . i only drank beer so i can not comment on the well drinks . i spent 90 % of my time up stairs on the roof where they were playing house music . i really enjoyed the videos playing on the wall over the bar . i found myself getting lost in them a bit , likely due to the beer consumption : -rrb- i only have two issues with the place : # 1 the bathrooms were gross ! there were only 2 stalls in the women 's bathroom for the entire club ! -lrb- there is an upstairs and a downstairs . -rrb- one stall was being used by a puking female and the other would n't flush . i get chills thinking about it again . # 2 one of the many bouncers , in an attempt to get somewhere quickly literally knocked me off my feet to get past me . while i understood his haste , i am a relatively small person and he was huge ! the staff needs to be a little more considerate when plowing people over .		3		0
potential but just ok . booth is comfortable . waiter is friendly . keeps refilling my coke . food is ok but could be so much better . their niche is serving non-traditional chain food . i did n't want anything with fries or potatoes so i gave them a try remembering they served quiche years ago . i ordered the corn chowder with scallops and the crab cakes with micro-greens . crab cakes very good . chowder had been on simmer for too long and scallops were rubbery . i would order the crab cakes with just a cup of chowder -lrb- no scallops -rrb- next time . i 'm going to go back and try the quiche next time .		3		0
just so much fun ! i love the idea , when i saw it on the food network that was showing fun eats in japan . so i jumped at the chance to go to the rotating sushi bar at desert ridge . i went with a friend , and we enjoyed the variety of items , edemame , carrot cake , asian sodas , cheesecake , poppers . the food wasnt spectaular , meaning , there was no flair to the food , just the standard sushi rolls . really fun to go out with a group or date . i will be back .		3		0
i love target , and super target is practically heaven for me ! i am so disappointed with this one , though , for it 's lack of customer service . its bad enough that they barely have vegetarian / vegan stuff . which i can live with because i have other stores for that . but when i buy say 125.00 bucks worth of stuff and i have to suffer the uncomfortable non conversation of the sales clerks ... that just makes any good shopping experience crap in my book . you might get a hello from them , and do n't let it be about time for them to go home - cause then you feel like your imposing on their day ... by making them do their job !? i ca n't take another ho-hum sales clerk , and this is the closest one to me . so target , dear target , hire someone that is n't a sour puss . give someone that deserves an eight dollar an hour job just that ! other than that , this place is very clean and always the target i expect . just ... fix your staff pleaeeeeeeeeeese !		3		0
hmmm , what can i say about keegan 's grill ? i 'm a rib lover so i remember the ribs fondly , however , it had strong pros and cons ... with more cons than pros . the pros were the ribs and the comfy casual feel of the restaurant . the ribs were delicious ... wish i 'd have ordered them . we got a full rack thinking we 'd have leftovers but , finished them all . the cons ... my shrimp pasta dish was really really watery and weak . it was also luke warm ... so much so that i worried later about possibly getting sick -lrb- i did n't -rrb- . i would have had it warmed more but , our pretty blond server was not very attentive . it was a really busy night but , drinks went out and we waited long periods of time for ... everything . normally i do n't mind that too much but this was enough for even me to notice . would i come back ? yes ... for the ribs . but if i have another lukewarm experience ... it probably wo n't be worth the drive for a 3rd trip . might see ya there .		3		0
my husband and i disagree on this one . i say 3 stars , he says 4 . i took into account the value , service , taste and atmosphere and a couple things were lacking . first , service . it took forever to take our order , get our drinks , etc. . there were 5 of us and we ordered the hummus trio which was tiny . there were about 2 spoonfuls of each hummus and 2 sliced pita bread . value was not great for what we got . however , i had the avgolemono soup and it was freaking delicious . my husband had the pastitsio and adored it . only it was made with ziti instead of the claimed macaroni . he also loves the gyros there which is why he gives it 4 stars .		3		0
52 different beers on tap ! in addition to the standard beers you 'll find at any restaurant , they have several locally produced brews so that anyone searching for a beer to fit their taste will most likely find it . i tried the white chocolate ale , which had a nicely toasted nut flavor with a white chocolate background , more of a refreshing light beer . my friend tried some of it and remarked that if dessert beers ever existed , this would be one of them . i 'm not too much of a beer fan and the closest beer-like beverage i 've enjoyed is lambic , but it did taste nice compared to other beers i 've had . we started with the scotch eggs , which were excellent . the breading was nice and crispy , the pork sausage was flavorful and moist , and the eggs were perfectly cooked with a deep golden color to the yolks . i had the vegetable panini for lunch , which was decent , albeit greasy . the coleslaw i ordered with it was creamy but bland . the menu itself has a weird mix of foods from different regions . i was surprised to see orange chicken on the menu on a pub menu that seems to be focused more on pub-type food like fish and chips and scotch eggs .		3		0
i have been here on a few occasions with my fiance and while i enjoy maizie 's , it always seems like she gets raw end of the deal . it is a decent place for brunch , but outside of that , i think maizie 's really struggles finding a strong and suitable identity for dinner . meal : i typically just brunch here . i have been here two dinner services but that was a while ago and apparently it was n't very memorable . taste : the food is mediocre . the food is billed as this well done , urban simply crafted meal that has a slight sophisticated or unique twist ; however , it really comes off as food missing a strong identity and not put together . i would almost categorize their food as if it was a meal that was put together by someone who was looking up random food network recipes and lacked the culinary experience to know if it would really work out . it is not that the meals are bad , but its really a restaurant that masquerades as this new wave of culinary philosophy and in reality , its just a step above denny 's and hackneyed . the meals i have ordered there are not well put together and lack cohesiveness . 6 out of 10 . value : their happy hour specials are usually pretty great but overall , its neither great or awful . 3 out of 5 . service/cleanliness : i have been usually happy with the service at this restaurant but there was one occasion where the waitress clearly did n't know the menu . when the food came out to our table , my fiances dish was missing a couple key ingredients listed on the menu . the waitress was absolutely sure about the dish was cooked correctly and it was until showing her the menu did she realize she was wrong . 7 out of 10 . atmosphere : the place is cute and has some of the best outdoor seating out of any restaurant in the area . the interior decorating is nice and so is the music . 4 out of 5 . overall : there are a ton of great locally owned business near maizes that i would go to . but hey , if your heart is set on this place , then go for it ... just do n't be too disappointed when you find out its mediocre . 21 out of 30 points , 3 out of 5 stars .		3		0
i have been living in scottsdale for over 10 years and i have never been to the iconic cowboy ciao until last weekend . i say `` iconic '' because i ca n't tell you how many times the restaurant has been recommended to me by locals , resort concierges , foodies , etc. . . and one of the reasons i never made it in until recently was because it can be rather challenging to get a table on a weekend . when i called to make reservations for saturday night i was n't surprised when the hostess gave me the options of 5:30 or 9:15 . i mentioned i would have to double check with the rest of my party , the hostess quickly stopped me and proclaimed that she just found a table for four at 7:45 . we arrived and quickly ordered a bottle of wine . the wine list is vast so 5 stars for that . the app i ordered was edible . a fried mac and cheese dish with salsa for dipping . the mac and cheese was shaped like slice of meatloaf with crispy edges and the cold tomato salsa seemed fresh but for some reason did n't really make a good match . i actually was expecting a more decadent experience like the mac and cheese sticks from fix at the belaggio so i was a bit disappointed . my main course was the chicken fried trout with sriracha aoli and cole slaw . two issues here , the fish was soggy because the slaw was on top . the way i figure it , when you order `` chicken fried '' anything you want crispy right ? why put wet cole slaw all over the top ? second , the sriracha aoli was not as spicy as i would have liked , but i spent a lot of time in new mexico so my perspective of spicy may be a bit off there . on a more positive note i tried my dinner companion 's stetson chopped salad , and that may have been one of the top 2 or 3 salads i have ever tried in my lifetime -lrb- i had a salad nicoise in paris years ago that will always be numero `` un '' in my heart -rrb- . also , the stilton blueberry cheesecake desert was fantastic . there was just that faint hint of moldy , blue cheesy , salty , stilton flavor which made it very unique and quite good . all in all , it was a good restaurant , and the service was adequate . i just think i ordered poorly . serves me right for ordering 2 fried dishes , but hey , it was my birthday so why not ?		3		0
we stopped in here for happy hour one evening at 5 pm on a friday and it was packed . the place is split into 2 rooms and a patio . we met a few friends in the back of one of the rooms . we noticed there were peanut shells on the floor ... cool , it 's one of those places . since they were so busy it took a long time to get our order placed . we had to flag down a server to get her attention . since we did n't want to wait twice , we ordered our beer and food at the same time . we browsed the menu and decided to order : nachos , $ 10.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=ruozkt-dprcwkcmvfgwchg#ruozkt-dprcwkcmvfgwchg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=aqtkhqinojpqzcu6d0xrqw#aqtkhqinojpqzcu6d0xrqw philly cheesesteak , $ 10.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=xeowkff0vogd-h3tjysj0g#xeowkff0vogd-h3tjysj0g the nachos were huge , enough for 2 people . they were good and had decent flavor . the guac and sour cream come in small cups so you have to dip your chips in them or take a knife to put on your chips ... i do n't prefer to eat my nachos that way . the philly cheesesteak was pretty good too ... far from the best i 've ever had , but decent . there were plenty of tv 's in the restaurant , so we were able to keep apprised of the hockey/football games on the tube . we had to flag down the server for refills of the beer ... that was the one downside to the visit was the service . perhaps we caught them on a short-handed night ? i dunno ... return factor - 50 %		3		0
this new yogurt place at citycenter of citynorth is a nice addition to the area . it 's a do-it-yourself place , so you grab a cup , head to the yogurt machines , dispense however much yogurt you want , then put on your own toppings , put it on the scale , and pay by weight -lrb- 39 cents/oz . -rrb- . now , about the yogurt . the flavor variety is a little disappointing . they have original tart -lrb- a la pinkberry , in la , or ice tango , in az -rrb- , pomegranate tart , vanilla , chocolate , strawberry , and oj . flavors may change , but this is what they had when i was there . the `` regular '' -lrb- i.e. non-tart -rrb- yogurt flavors were just okay - i would make the trip to golden spoon instead , as they have the best and most variety of flavors . but the tart flavors were very good - pomegranate was delicious , and the original was n't quite up to pinkberry standards -lrb- a little too icy , more like sorbet , although i prefer that to too creamy in a tart flavor -rrb- , but still good . they have a nice selection of toppings -lrb- fresh fruit , nuts , cereal , mochi , some other british stuff i 'd never heard of -rrb- , although it 's always a little scary having it self-serve -lrb- salad bar style -rrb- so it sits out for people to get their germs on your food . overall , i think this place will do well , if for no other reason than it 's the only yogurt place in the area , but i actually enjoy their tart flavors and toppings very much !		3		0
i 'm so conflicted here , that i will just add the pros and cons and land in the middle with my rating . uncle sam 's has what is arguably the cheapest happy hour drinks in all the valley . beer is a buck a pint and a half bottle of wine for 5 bucks ! it goes until 7 , so we usually squeak in just under the gun . the `` bail out plan '' menu is also incredibly varied and cheap . they do lots of mailings and coupons as well . the food is good -lrb- not great -rrb- , but always seems to satisfy ! service varies , but is generally quite speedy and good . the servers look somewhat hustled and overworked . i wish i could give the place a quick update of style and maybe some new floors , tables , and a different layout . it seems too crowded with tables and can get really loud . word of advice : sit in the `` front half '' . the back seems even more conducive to a panic attack from sitting literally right next to another table . they need a re-brand and some new plates and silverware . there is a small patio out front with some concrete tables . you can tell they keep the place clean , it just needs a makeover . we unfortunately have sat by some fellow patrons lately who seem to fight , forget they are adults in public and really seem to bring the place down . for these negatives , i give 3 stars . uncle sam 's sure tries , but there is unfortunately some work to be done ! however , if you like cheaply priced beer , wine and food , this place is for you ! we keep going back !		3		0
this is a really good place to eat ... most of the time . i have tried several things off the menu but there is really only one thing i like there , lunch . otherwise i would have given it higher marks . they have a fantastic ginger dressing with the lunch salad and to date is still my favorite dressing period . they serve it in advance of the lunch item you ordered and fried won-ton chips come with that . the combined flavors and crunchy of the chips make it a great intro to the main lunch item . my one and only favorite thing at flo 's it the ginger beef . it 's in a dark spicy sauce and i also order it with peanuts . this flavor combination will rock you and the beef is very tender . try it for lunch some time .		3		0
meh ... i had high expectations for this joint and it sadly did n't cut the mustard . the staff was very friendly and accommodating to our party , who had changed the reservation size twice and showed up late -lrb- oops ! we accidentally went to the scottsdale quarter -rrb- . my party enjoyed the prix-fixe meals for restaurant week . the appetizers were certainly the highlight here -- baked brie , hummus , and calamari . each was tasty , had a unique twist : the brie was accompanied with garlic and cherries and the hummus was topped with tomatoes , feta , and cucumbers . the dinner portions were small and sufficient . i personally like salt , so the salty scallop dish did n't bother me . however , another diner in our group took issues with the overly salty dish . the chocolate cake was not worth the calories . i 'm a huge fox concept restaurant fan , but greene house did n't do it for me . go next door -lrb- literally -rrb- to north or to the scottsdale quarter to true food kitchen for a better fox dining experience .		3		0
how could you do away with your szechuan slaw cpk ? there are some things in life that you just do n't mess with . that is just wrong . all the food we ordered tonight was average . not great not bad . we got the arugula salad from the side plate 's special menu and the 4 cheese ravioli entree to share . everything was okay . we also got this corn , guacamale dip with chips that actually was pretty good . nothing to write home about in the great dept but nothing to complain about either . welllllllll , except that they did away with the szechuan slaw . did i mention they did away with their szechuan slaw ? sigh , oh well . i wont be back . i only go there to get me some of that .		3		0
i 'd happily eat there again if hungry and in the neighborhood , but i ca n't say i 'd make a special trip . mostly the basics here , typical rolls and sushi selection with nothing out of the ordinary -lrb- i 'm thinking you 're out of luck if you are hankering fro monk fish liver -rrb- . we ordered a yellow tail hand roll and asked of they could do it with scallions ... nope , they do n't have scallions -lrb- is n't yellow tail & scallions common ? -rrb- . they did happily prepare a salmon skin hand roll for us even though it is not on the menu on the menu . despite the odd construction -lrb- all the rice in the bottom and all the salmon skin on top like ice cream in a cone -rrb- , once i figured out i needed to redistribute the ingredients , it was quite tasty . the soft shell crab roll was on happy hour special and a simple bit of tasty goodness . the salmon sashimi was ok - the fish was fresh , but did n't have the melt-like-butter quality of some of the top notch places . service was pleasant , and the atmosphere is urban with a bit of funk thrown in . the floor to ceiling windows face north , allowing abundant natural light without overpowering the place .		3		0
i am unsure why this place has 4 stars . it was mediocre at best . the only reason i 'm giving it 3 stars is because our server was so sweet . i felt their menu items were lacking . reasonably priced for sure , but just not a lot to choose from . they are vegan friendly which is nice . i 'm not a vegan , but i like eating healthy , so the fact that the options are available -lrb- like tempeh which i love -rrb- are a plus . but they did n't even have many options for coffee . the food took a fairly long time considering they were n't very busy . the server explained everything is made fresh and that 's why it takes so long . is n't everything made fresh at most small restaurants ? i would expect nothing less ? just seemed unusually long . the food itself was decent , but i felt like it was something i could 've made myself in my kitchen . i definitely was n't blown away by anything and overall the place just seemed very average . not a bad thing i guess , but would n't be anywhere close to my first choice for brunch . sorry !		3		0
imagine my dismay when i rolled up to the ghetto target on 7th ave and see it moved to 19th ave. all righty then . so i fight the traffic/construction/random people in the road/low riders/huge trucks/light rail and go deeper into the west side . west siiiiiiiiide indeed . i have no idea what that means . the mere size of the building and parking lot are impressive . i 'm happy with the spacious aisles and great food section . the home section is all right too . the accessories and clothes section is pretty terrible . the indian bend/101 britney spears target is much better for non-food items . the store is laid out in a very confusing way but i think i 'll get used to it . oh - one really gross thing : i found a dead bug - that 's right - a b-u-g in one of the decorative x-mas bags i bought . ew . clean up ! otherwise average .		3		0
hob nobs coffee house is in this quaint little old house on mcdowell not far from the downtown area . upon entering i was n't clear as to if i was in a coffee house or a trendy gift shop with art for sale everywhere you looked . i also did not experience the aroma of freshly brewed coffee as i walked in but i was greeted by a very friendly person behind their counter that offered to make me a cup of joe . their coffee was congenial and pleasant . they had a limited amount of the normal coffee house accompaniments ~ a few pastries and cookies ~ to coffee . they seemed to be more of a café or dinner based on what they are offering their customers . pizza at a coffee house ? now that 's different ... they have a huge selection of pizzas , sandwiches and wraps . salads and a few breakfast and bunch options as well . it was very difficult to get as comfy as i do in most coffee houses , but then again i 'm not sure this is really a coffee house but more of a café `` slash '' gift shop . nothing against the owners and i do n't blame them for trying to maximize their revenues through additional avenues other than coffee . but you might consider changing your name to hob nobs café and gift shop ? this is a cool place to meet people for lunch you do n't know . hear me out ~ their tables and chairs are not very comfy so it makes it easier for you to end your conversation . this can be a good thing you know : - -rrb-		3		0
they have a great variety of food here and the staff is really nice . unfortunately the food was not that tasty . it was n't horrible , just not what i was expecting . the mac and cheese was pretty bland and milky , so i would not suggest you order that . the manager was great abt removing that from our bill . i love that they have the gardein meat substitute here and have so many options for vegetarians . the gardein buffalo wings were a great consistency , but too salty and spicy . the truffle fries were good . the dessert sampler is a great idea . our favorite was definitely the lemon . it was delicious . i will order that alone next time .		3		0
my hubby & i came here for lunch this past saturday & we thought it was pretty damn good . i got the little bacon cheeseburger & hubs got the bacon cheeseburger -lrb- 2 patties of beef -rrb- . we are 1 in the same & got the same toppings : lettuce , pickles & mustard . oh & he opted for the grilled onions which i wish i had done , too . we each got a regular order of fries as well . we should of just shared an order , more than half of the bag was filled with fries ! ca n't even imagine how big the large order is . we thought it was cool that they have peanuts & that you can just toss the shells on the ground , something different . for our burgers , fries & drinks it was about $ 22 & some change , not too bad . we will definitely come back for lunch , but not anytime soon since these kinds of places you should only eat at once in a while . we 'll see if we like it as much the 2nd time around . we get easily burnt out on places like this : i.e. culver 's & in n out .		3		0
having loved this place for years as is , they up and changed the menu . the lower calorie menu is completely hacked to pieces and has only 4 items on it . the moroccan salmon and chicken were both gone . as was my favorite sandwich , the southwest chicken , which started my love affair with this restaurant initially in the early 2000 's . but alas , the love affair is over ! this time i tried the steak frites -lrb- steak over their garlic fries -rrb- . the `` tangy '' sauce they advertise being put on the steak is freaking ketchup . it was nasty . the steak was cooked fine , but the ketchup ruined it . and the fries were not done -lrb- and i think they forgot the garlic -rrb- . i was so disappointed . this was our 2nd visit since the menu changed and our 2nd disappointment . i have no reason to go back anymore .		3		0
this place seems like a hole in wall but the food is very good and modest . they have chicken or steak . this chicken is red on the outside and the flavor is great . you can get plates or meals . you get tortillas , some plain salsa , cabbage that is very good , and your meat . i 've only been here a few times but if you want something casual and feel like something yummy you can eat with your hands i would recommend it . the prices are very reasonable . you can eat here or take it to go .		3		0
ya know how people say `` i really wanted to like this place '' or `` i want to like this place more than i do '' ? it 's such a stupid thing to say , because obviously you want to like a place , you do n't go somewhere and say `` i really want to hate spending my money here and eating their food . '' well anyway , rant aside . i do actually want to like this place and i come here pretty regularly , but the service is so annoying . my work buddies and i like to come in after work for a few beers and some food . the food is pretty good , i love their spicy thai hummus , and the beers are obviously great , the patio is comfortable with heaters in the winter as well . but the service just irks the crap out of me . the girls usually are swamped no matter how many people are there . most of the time , we do n't even know who our server actually is because two or three people come over and take our orders . sometimes the first girl leaves and trades us off to someone new , or the girl just flat out disappears . most of the time , our drinks sit empty until someone finally sees us and takes another order , other times our drinks are n't even halfway empty and theyre trying to get us another round . they 're friendly and nice , but being nice is n't really the only way to do things . meh , maybe i 'm too critical , but i should n't have to ask the food runner for plates , napkins and silverware . or glasses of water like three or four times . i 'll keep coming here because the alternative options suck even more : ahem twin peaks ahem skeptical chymist ahem :		3		0
we visited blanco scottsdale for the first time and came away impressed . blanco 's is one of the fox restaurant group places , and it is a nice concept in upscale gourmet mexican food . http://www.foxrc.com/ the chicken fajitas were flavorful at $ 15.00 , as were the machaca tacos for $ 12.00 and bbq pork tacos for $ 11.00 -lrb- see photos -rrb- . the ground beef nachos -lrb- $ 12.00 , plus $ 6.00 for a side of guacamole -rrb- went pretty quickly . our lunch bill for a party of four came to $ 68.53 before tip and everything was very good , though admittedly some of the portions were small .		3		0
i went here to grab lunch and a beer between classes . the service was n't all that great . i do n't think the waitress ever told me her name . i ordered the fish tacos and a tall beer . they start you off with chips and salsa . the chips were really good but the salsa could have been better . the fish tacos were just okay . they needed something more . the food came out quickly which was a plus . as others have mentioned , this place definitely has potential but needs a bit of work . i definitely will go back in the future during my lunch break .		3		0
this was the first time today that i was at a restaurant surrounded by cocks . and , sadly , this was n't as stellar an experience as i 'd hoped . : -lrb- robert m and i went here for breakfast this morning and apparently that 's a meal too early to be considered for taking here . the much-zinged about tacos would n't be served until 11 a.m. and it was 9:30 a.m. . what to do but order a drink . we did ; the bloody mary , which is made with house made charred tomatoes , pureed and served with absolut vodka -lrb- can you believe this is their well ? for sure ! -rrb- . we both needed to doctor up our drinks , because we like them spicier and i need salt in my everything , yet it was still short of great . now , had i been wearing my flask belt buckle and thought ahead to fill it with vodka , this might have been a better bloody mary . with the menu limitations in mind , our choices were limited . as we were meeting up with another couple , we did n't want to eat too much and just sit and watch this couple eat , so we ordered the cheese crisp . or was it crispy cheese ? either way , it 's basically cheese toasted on a skillet until it 's good and bubbly and crispy , rolled loosely and server . good , and i 'll try to make this at home . huevos rancheros was my breakfast selection but i 'd filled up too much on the crisp , water and bloody mary and was n't able to finish it myself . bless my pumpkin 's heart , robert finished for me . apparently the service was off this morning , and it was painfully obvious . from being brought juice glasses for our water -lrb- i drink a lot of water and need constant refills -rrb- to feeling like we were left to fend for ourselves throughout the meal , something definitely was n't flowing smoothly . however , i do want to come back and give this place another try . the volume of positive reviews showcase that gallo blanco can provide an exceptional dining experience . until that time , i will have to round up my 2.45 stars to 3 stars . please , gallo blanco . do n't let me down next time .		3		0
the beer selection won me over . this place has all the charm of a hospital waiting room . it 's not a place that you want to kick back for a few hours and drink because its so bright and uncomfortable . aside from that the bartender kept trying to hand me my tab when i was n't ready to go but dammit i was staying and trying every beer i wanted to try . or so i thought . the beers are strong . at the time i went , they have an excellent selection of ipa 's , one nitro which was so fucking tasty , shit dreams are made of ... i ca n't remember being this happy about a beer selection since i was at papago brewery - hey now there 's a place you can spend a lot of time at - take notes angels .		3		0
zipps is weak . it 's really nice inside ... but very loud -lrb- it is a sports bar -rrb- . my parents wanted some peace and quiet so we relocated out on to the patio . do n't sit out here if you have an aversion to cigarette smoke . in arizona , people are still allowed to smoke on patios . i left zipps with the feeling that days had been taken off my life just from the exposure to second-hand smoke . i was expecting a lot more , but zipps was a weak experience ... but ... it is a sports bar -- a very loud one at that . food was fresh but it 's nothing great . we had two waitresses . . one was in training , so we cut her a little slack for the delay . i had the bbq-ranch chopped chicken salad . chicken was fresh off the grill and the lettuce was cool and crunchy , but it was so ... elementary . then again ... what can i expect from this type of restaurant ? my parents loved their meal . but how can you mess up a turkey sandwich , chicken noodle soup and a greek salad ? i was eager to get home after the meal ... after waiting 15 minutes for the bill i was extremely frustrated . oh , if you ever feel the urge to go out and get drunk at all goldie 's and zipp 's locations , there is a shuttle available to fulfill your desire . i pray the people who do this take a cab home at the end of the night .		3		0
my older sister , brother and i came into big earl 's one night as we were craving some bbq , and we were eager to try the newest james porter spot . we were the only table in the place , which could be normal for a fairly new spot . the waiter came by our table and welcomed us , and we inquired about a wine list of sorts . the waiter informed us that they do n't have a wine list , that they only have `` keg wine '' . he said it with an inflection in his voice that made it sound like this was not something i should try . however , being that both my sister and i have lived in europe , we know that `` table wine '' or `` tap wine '' can be very good , so we asked for a sample regardless . the white variety of table wine was n't great , lacked any real palette , but the red was good ! the red was reminiscent of a red zin , so we went with a few glasses of red . alas , do not be thrown off when the waiter informs you they have keg wine , because he is certainly not serving you franzia . we ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer , and then both my sister and brother got chicken sandwiches . the fried pickles were done as spears , and they were `` new '' pickles . they tasted like they were marinated in house , but that they werent given enough time to really pick up that strong dill flavor . i would recommend doing them as chips as the fried pickle chips are easier to eat than spears , and i would also let the pickles marinate longer to get a fuller flavor . both my sister and my brother commented that their chicken was dry , and despite being the only table in the place , they got my brother 's order wrong but were quick to fix it . i think that the concept is great , but the execution is n't quite there yet . with time and staff education , i think this place could shine .		3		0
crust is the type of restaurant that is worth checking out , but not quite worth coming back for again . everything about it is alright : the ambiance is alright , the food is alright and the service is alright , but nothing really makes this pizza place stand out from the zillion other pizza places in scottsdale . according to their menu , they are known for their `` hand stretched '' rustica pizza -lrb- the one that is shaped like thong underwear -rrb- , however even that was mediocre . we decided to try their famous thong pizza , along with a few other slices of pepperoni and sausage pizza and a fried mozzarella appetizer . the fried mozzarella was decent , but nothing memorable or especially good compared to other places . the slices of pizza were pretty good sized and tasty , which was fortunate since we had to wait about 45 minutes after we finished our slices to get our rustica ! they must have been doing a lot of hand stretching back there , because it sure did take a long time for it to arrive . it was good , but nothing we would want to wait nearly an hour for again . to sum up , if you 're in the mood for a decent enough pizza , then go to crust , but just do n't expect to have really memorable or exceptional dining experience because you will be disappointed when that does n't happen .		3		0
i checked out this place for the international supper club uye . i love checking out food from around the world , in the us and in it 's native land . so , this was cool . i 've never been to bosnia . i wondered what the food could be like because bosnia is a literally cultural melting pot with mediterranean , european and middle eastern influences . i was eager to give it a try and see if any of those 3 cultures dominated the influence on the food . you might drive past the tiny shopping plaza in which this restaurant is located . why you ask ? because it is about as nondescript as a traffic light , except you pay attention to the traffic light . it 's also a rather run down plaza and is not attractive . no worries , pull in to that parking lot and yeah , you 'll look around like , `` where is ursula sending me ... ????? '' seriously , go inside . you 'll quickly realize that you 've escaped the ho ' hum and entered eastern europe . the inside of that restaurant is so neatly decorated , you feel like you 're in eastern europe . fortunately , i was with a great group of yelpers . i teamed up with preston s to split our entrees . he ordered the pljeskavica and i ordered the cevapi . both of these items are served on the tastiest , flakiest , buttery pastry type bread i 've had in quite some time . the pljeskavica was a 4-star item with a the beef patty , mushrooms and cheese on that flaky pastry-like bun . i would order this item again ! the cevapi was somewhat like a kabob , but really reminded me of jimmy dean breakfast sausages in appearance . but not in taste . these small sausages are made of beef and lamb and are seasoned with bosnian spices . this was a 3-star item for me . if i ever get back over there , i must try the burek . i have a feeling that i will enjoy that immensely ! unfortunately , any place that serves dinner , but not wine generally gets a one-star-off from me . this could have been a 4-star review from me ! i wonder if you can do a byob . i have to keep in mind that no booze could be a religious choice as well . so i 'm giving them a 3.5 instead of taking the whole 1 star . i always bump 3.5 star reviews to 4 stars .		3		0
classic case of overhype leading to disappointment . after waiting 30 minutes to get sat , we ordered of their tiny , tiny breakfast menu . i ordered a cheese omelet and waffle . the waffle was excellent the rest was blah . the eggs in my omelet were not scrabbled all the way so chunks of yolks kept presenting themselves and they clearly added the cheese at the last second because it was n't melted . the home fries were greasy and had no seasoning besides rosemary . i had to cover everything in salt until i finally gave up and left the greasy mess on my plate . on the plus side my husband enjoyed his breakfast and the service was good		3		0
i have been going to farrelli 's for years , since they first opened . i love the idea of this place . remember people , 3 stars is n't bad it means a-ok . i would give the concept 5 stars . the atmosphere is cool . i love the old movie posters in the hallway . most of the seating is comfortable . i would much rather watch a movie like this instead of being crammed like a sardine in a typical theater . service is almost always good . 4 stars . on their busier nights the service has been a little rushed and impersonal . however they are always quick when you page them for something during a movie . now we come to the food ... when they first opened their food was 4 stars . tasty and simple . i also had their catered food at a couple weddings and it was 4 star food as well . i am sad to say that in the last few years the quality of the food has gone down drastically . my husband and i went a few nights ago and it hit rock bottom . my sandwich was dry and tasteless . my husband liked his burger but he was horrified when he bit into a still frozen french fry . yuck . drink prices are steep . $ 7 for a draft beer . really ? the food prices would be fair if the food quality was a little better . i hope the owners take the criticisms to heart . i still love farrelli 's and always have a good time when i go .		3		0
this is the first japanese 60s-style diner i 've ever been to . there was only one other table of people when i visited and the ambiance was dead silent . only one older man working the front of house . he took our order and delivered our dishes . to pay , we walked up to the register . the sashimi platter is a good choice for two to three people . it came with a ton of tuna and salmon slices . the miso , edamame , chicken yakitori skewer , and gyoza sides were tasty . also included was an interesting cup of tiny salmon slices with scallions and a sweet soy sauce . the tuna and eel rolls were nice , in case you prefer sushi to sashimi . overall , the fish was good , but i have had better . the prices are a bit high , but the dishes come with plenty of sushi , however , competitors like ra have higher quality fish . due to the competition in the area , it is a bit tough to say i would come back . however , i did have a good meal and got plenty of food .		3		0
wavering on what to score i will stick with 3 . i want to see this place succeed . it 's really too new to provide a fair judgment . i enjoyed my experience there enough to take in a few more visits and provide later updates . high scores for concept and convenience to where i live and downtown in general . the food flavor , quality and authenticity is there . i will have to say the tortillas were good , i have had better but i have definitely had much worse . on this trip i ordered the guacamole and pork chile verde , which came with rice , beans and 2 kinds of salsa and tortilla . i also chose the fresh limeade to drink . total came to around $ 13 . the guacamole is superb -lrb- as i sit at my desk finishing up the guac and salsa from last night for brunch -rrb- . the freshness comes right through , from the fresh garlic , jalapenos onions , cilantro , tomatoes ... chopped perfectly ... about as good as i make at home -lrb- which is definitely a compliment -rrb- . the salsas , tasty ... the verde has to be my favorite of the two . the beans were simple and topped with queso fresco and the rice seasoned simply was also quite nice . now for the chile verde , yum ! well seasoned pork simmered with green chiles was tender and shreaded with just the right amount of heat for the general crowd -lrb- maybe even a bit spicy for some but do n't change it -rrb- . i would take a bit of guac and a scoop of pork and add it into a piece of tortilla ... mmmmm . the limeade was fresh and very sweet ... they could have added a little more water to it and it would have extended their batch and it would be perfect . they went out of their way to make sure everything was just right . the girl at the register was young and new and admitted she was still getting a feel for the place . i am excited about this new addition to the neighborhood .		3		0
today , hubby and i rode from jefferson and 12th st. -lrb- the stop closest to our house -rrb- to mill ave. and 3rd st. in tempe to check out the metro rail and have lunch at rula bula . christ almighty , it was crowded . both ways we waited for the next train because there was no room on the first one . there was really no room on the second one either , but it was squish or not bother going . i can also see that there will need to be some training of valley passengers regarding rail etiquette : 1 . give the people getting off the cars a freaking second to do so before barrelling in . 2 . do n't sit on the floor of the car . not only are you more likely to get stepped on -lrb- especially if the conductor sucks , and the one on the return trip had a lead foot -rrb- , but you are also taking up 2-3 times the space of someone standing . 3 . wear deodorant , people . 4 . there 's no need for you to stand on the edge of the platform and crane to see the cars coming . it will not make the metro rail come any faster . 5 . be considerate of others , and maybe not rap loudly about `` it 's yo ' birf-day , so i 'm a-gonna kill you , '' on a crowded rail car . now , i do have high hopes for the metro rail , and hubby and i already have plans to use it again this week - but we 'll be waiting until the free days are over . full ? i hope it will be . crazy , chaotic , and dangerous ? we hope that will not be the case regularly . there were many people around us who admitted they were riding it with no destination at all , just back and forth , up and down . wish i had that much free time .		3		0
the rating should probably be closer to 3.5 stars . this was my first dim sum experience in arizona . i have had chinese cuisine one other time at ace in mesa and it was ordinary . the dim sum was decent but definitely does not compare to the culinary bay area !!!! with that said , it does the trick if you are out here . the wait staff was extremely friendly and there was a good variety of items to choose from . biggest plus it was reasonably price , well compared to the bay area . 7 dishes for $ 26 including tip . i would come back .		3		0
unfortunately , i visited mimita 's back in may and have since forgotten a lot of details . i , however , do remember that the food was not that great . maybe i just happened to get a rogue `` bad '' plate of food . i do distinctly remember that i thoroughly enjoyed the ` tamal cubano '' which was a corn tamale with pork . service was pretty good considering that we had a group of 20 . all other members enjoyed their meals immensely except me ... so i probably did get the rogue plate . as a result , i doubt i would take another chance here on my own .		3		0
i do n't understand all of the one star reviews on google places . they made me put off eating here but i am glad i ended up ignoring them . the place was bright and clean and pretty typical of chinese place i have been in from vancouver canada to phoenix . i had the # 5 : fried rice , chow mien , sweet and sour pork and egg foo young . my friend had the # 2 with shrimp and egg roll instead of the last two items on my combo . the chow mien was the best i have had . balanced and flavorful and it reminded me of the spot i ate in as a kid . the pork was good and classic amer-chinese . the breading on my friends shrimp was very thick but the shrimp was good , his egg roll was over cooked . my egg foo young was decent but unremarkable . will definitely hit this spot against some time		3		0
i 've probably been to this mall more than any other in the valley just because it is the closest to me and it has a yankee candle store . i think it was much nicer before they added all the kiosks in the middle . but almost every mall now has them . surprisingly at noon on sunday of the labor day weekend i had no trouble parking just a few steps outside the southeast entrance . it filled out a little bit by the time i left but nowhere near the crowds you would expect on what is normally a big sale/shopping weekend . even though they have had a couple of the original anchors go under in the last couple of years they have re-leased those spots quickly which has helped keep the mall busy and vibrant . in addition to yankee candle i shop at the knife shop , jc penneys , and just sports .		3		0
ok , ok , i gave 'em another chance . let 's just say last fall i had a shrimp fried rice that disagreed more with me than rosie odonnell disagrees with anne coulter . after several hours bowing to the porcelin god , i vowed never to return . well , everyone deserves a second chance , rice , er , um i mean , right ? plus it so convienent to my job and home . pork lo mein has become a fav of mine and i actually crave it . for about $ 7 i usually have leftovers i can enjoy later . my bf rickie is a spicy man so he loves spicy food , his craving , the sun devil chickien with gobs of jalepenos . we enjoy the crab puffs as well . pretty standard chinese fare , but the place lately has been spotless and the service great . it 's tiny and probably does more take out and delivery . i say they 're worth a shot if you 're in the hood . chow chow yelpers !		3		0
last night was my first night at ck 's tavern & grill . the place was packed which is a great thing for any business in our current economy . that tells you a lot about it . i have to say the staff was outstanding ! the food was good not great but good . the issue i had and could only give it three stars was the fact that we were put in a room for #evfn and children were allowed back in our area . now #evfn is not a private event but it 's not exactly kid friendly . i think i would have liked to have seen something that stated the room was reserved for a group . husband and i both noticed we had to talk louder because the children were yelling around us . we ended up leaving as soon as our meal was done . i 'm not a fan of children screaming in my ear while they play games and i 'm trying to dine . i definitely will give this place a try again because the menu items were very interesting .		3		0
wow , smack dab in the middle of scottsdale , and i had yet to try it . until today ... having lunched there today , i have mixed feelings . i think my review would align most with my fellow yelper , don j . this place has potential . the atmosphere is great : great artwork , great colors , cheerful , clean . even the service was good , which seems to be an improvement since the reviews began . and the food was good too , but it missed that special something that don j. was trying to describe ... i think the ingredients are quality , but give me something a bit unusual , mix up the ingredients , try a new sauce , create that special something that makes me want to come back .		3		0
two things : 1 -rrb- pizzeria bianco is easily the best pizza i 've ever had , and chris bianco is a god among men when it comes to food . 2 -rrb- i realize what i 'm about to say is sacrilege ... ... but i do n't get pane bianco . i should n't say `` i do n't get it '' . i mean , it 's good and all , but these are n't the best sandwiches i 've ever had . their solid , and i 'll go back if friends of mine want to try it out , but i just do n't think it 's all that great . i 'm sorry to say this , but i can not deny my heart , and my heart does n't really care about these sandwiches . even the mozzarella one .		3		0
been here a few times and the sushi itself is pretty decent . sitting outside on the side , not front , is nice . the service tends to be a little slow and disorganized . they brought the food out in a very strange order so half of us were always without , party of 6 . we had a good time nonetheless . the rolls are ok , although i am more of a sashimi and nigiri guy . the yellowtail sashimi was fresh , nigiris were what you would expect , miso soup could be better . i had an unfiltered sake that was good . overall , not nearly the best sushi or ambiance around but not bad given the location and decent to good sushi .		3		0
with all the mediocore to scathing reviews , i 've always said no way to pei wei . i ordered for pick up and had a very friendly , helpful , if not jeff spicoli sounding , employee help me with my first ever pei wei experience . at 9pm on a thursday night there was plenty of parking and i found the little pei wei place to be 1/4 full and actually a nice looking room . the surly person -lrb- manager type -rrb- who rung up my order , must have had to much msg as he was irritable and i must say a bit puffy . but most importantly , after devouring our take out , rickie and i voted four thumbs up -lrb- that 's two thumbs for each of us , times two , carry the one ... well you get the idea -rrb- for three of the four items . so spring rolls , potstickers and korean beef ... you 'll soon be hanging with us again soon . pad thai ? yea . you 're not invited . unless you can sauce it up a bit and find it in your heart to bring along more tofu and veggies . but i 'm not counting on it . pei wei ? yes way for this gay ! ok !?		3		0
okay , so i like canteen and all , but dear lord , let 's turn that music down a notch ! these guys have a great happy hour , but i realistically would n't come here if it were n't for that . i quite enjoy the small bites ' baby back ribs - the portions are so small , but since they are half price during happy hour , i get two orders ! i 'm not a big fan of tequila , but i know they have a big selection -lrb- obviously -rrb- . i really like the atmosphere here , and the service has always been good . i may or may not come back , but we 'll see . three solid stars from me .		3		0
i have n't been to z-tejas ' restaurant for years . my wife loves the restaurant and i must have had a bad experience at the one in tempe . i do n't remember the reason , but i 've always bypass them . since it was three days before christmas and it was my turn to choose a restaurant , i chose z-tejas because we had to return an item to macy 's . our server , crystal , was very polite and keep our glasses full , even checking on us every now and then to see that we were enjoying our meal . we thought about happy hour , but decided on the full menu . i had the pepita crusted chicken and my wife had the chicken enchilada with black beans and no rice . my entree looked very appetizing with cilantro pesto chicken breast sliced in half and ayered with sweet potato hash , spinach , artichokes and mushrooms , served with roasted poblano sauce . there was too many chopped carrots surrounding the entry to give it color . but it was tasty . my wife 's entree was also delicious and there was a lot of black beans which covered half of the plate . we ended the course with the multi-berry cobbler served in a cast-iron skillet . it was really sweet and the ice cream helped by cutting the sweetness of the dessert . now the question is will i go back . i will , but not in the near future .		3		0
enjoyed lunch here with my wife recently . very abundant bowls of noodles in a beef , chicken or perhaps seafood broth - depending on what you order . i had a shrimp item and was a bit disappointed with the fact that it only contained 2 shrimp . but it was seriously delicious nonetheless . our waitress was very attentive and spent time -lrb- as mentioned by others -rrb- going over the menu . i love asian soups so i will be going back here soon to try other dishes .		3		0
i 'm not disappointed with ray 's pizza , i 'm just not all that impressed either . it probably does n't help that when it comes to the battle of new york vs chicago pizza , i 'm chicago all the way . ray 's pizza is quite cheesy , the crust is very crunchy . $ 2.50 for a generously cut slice -lrb- that 's for cheese , toppings are extra -rrb- is n't too steep . i had a slice of cheese and a slice of pesto . both were good , just not anything amazing . i ca n't say i 've ever been to the ray 's pizza in new york -lrb- or any of the infinite number of other places in new york also called ray 's -rrb- , so i ca n't compare if this is anything like the real new york pie . there 's nothing wrong with ray 's pizza . i just would n't go out of my way to eat there again .		3		0
it really is like the subway of sushi here ! you go to the counter , order your wrapping -lrb- seaweed or soy -rrb- , and customize vegetables , meats , spices , and sauces before it 's wrapped , and then cut in their special multi-cutting machine . for sides , they offer selections such as miso soup or edamame , and you can make it a combo with side and drink for a little over $ 2 . they also offer a selection of non custom rolls for those do n't feel like making their own . i got a salmon roll -lrb- they offer spicy , smoked , and regular raw versions here -rrb- with asparagus , green onion , and avocado . it was a huge portion , and i was definitely full after just 1 roll . i upgraded by getting a combo , and the miso soup was light , and not too salty . the quality of the roll itself : decent . the rice was a little mushy , but the veggies and salmon tasted ok . my friend had the 3 alarm roll , and it looked out of this world good ! it was topped with so much sauce and spicy ingredients that she could only finish about half of it . parking can be very difficult if you come here around lunchtime . i had to circle around the block twice before luck was on my side and a spot opened up . service was very friendly , and they were very patient as they explained the concept of the restaurant to me since i was a neophyte here . i 'd probably go here again to try out another roll , but probably at a less busy time . it 's a cool concept to create your own roll , for a pretty reasonable price .		3		0
took my sister here for her 21st it just happened to fall on a monday so this was the best thing we could come up with . where to park ?!?! parking is slim here fyi ! there was 10 of us they gave us the whole left side of the bar area . the hostess was really polite we were very happy till we met our waiter . he did n't seem too happy to be there , could have possibly been new , either way i expected better service for the occassion . we did not just order the $ 10 tini and mani deal there were n't that many to choose from . there was no one else in the bar area and i still had to go up to the bar several time 's to order drinks - the bartender was great + could use an extra toilet or stall - the mani 's were a treat , the manicurist 's were chatty and fun . we ordered more drinks and dinner after all our nail 's were done . i dont think you can go wrong with the food here being a veg i was totally satisfied 5 star 's for food ! i will absolutely go back for the food !		3		0
craving for some tacos so we went to this america 's taco shop the other day for lunch . they have three locations now and they seem to be doing well since there were a lot of folks dining here when we arrived . the restaurant is quaint , very clean and nicely decorated with a few tv 's . they have a very patio for dining with friends , whether permitting of course . service ~ you walk in , up to the counter and place your order . the folks working here are friendly and accommodating . they do a lot of carry out in addition to their dine in . food ~ we had their carne asada tacos , al pastor burritos , some shrimp ceviche since it was on a saturday and their chips and salsa with guacamole . the carne asada was diced rather than pulled so it had a different texture than what i am used to . it tasted ok and with a little of their salsa and a lite squeeze on the lime my tacos went from ok to very good . the al pastor buro had a good balance of spice with grilled pineapples and plenty of cilantro , lettuce and salsa , it was also ok to good . the salsa and chips were really tasty but their guac was not something i would order again . the shrimp ceviche was very disappointing since i 'm a huge fan of ceviche . bits of diced cucumber , onion , tomato with diced shrimp ? it was more of a salsa with a little shrimp added . the beer was excellent !! they have a nice patio so it 's a great place to dine for lunch or dinner next time you are craving some tacos !		3		0
i 've been a fan of cracker barrel , my first intro to it was back in roanoke , virginia where i had the chicken fried chicken , and had their fried apples . i really like their fried apples coz it reminds me of the wholesome , and slightly sweetish tart of an apple pie filling . anywho , recently went to brunch at the cracker barrel and ordered the country boy special , an $ 8.99 deal with 3 eggs , a choice of country ham , pork chops or sirloin steak . i chose the pork chops . it also comes with the hashbrown cake , fried apples , grits , gravy and two biscuits . a whole lotta food but worth the deliciousness and calories . i have to admit their pork chops are tender and yum , i 've always heard good things about the pork chops in the past . apart from that liked the gravy and their soft and warm buttermilk biscuits . i was stuffed , and had to take home my fried apples which i do love alone or with some vanilla ice cream , the perfect afternoon treat ! overall , if you 'd like yum country food , this place is good even for a chain ! oh and depending on the month , ask if they have their awesome coca cola chocolate cake ... it 's yum !		3		0
i decided to stop in before going to see sarah brightman at jobing dot com arena . i was off to a late start but wanted to enjoy a good meal before the show to make a night of it . i enjoyed the ambiance of the place right off . the usual dark wood and dark booths but i liked the decor . it just looked ` comfortable ' to me for lack of a better word . the place was busy ... most of it seemed pre-concert rush . i was told my server would be right there and then in a minute or so the manager came over to get a drink order . my server was at an adjacent table and seemed to be dealing with a ` problem ' table . from what i could hear it seemed to be one of those `` i want this ... but with this and not with that ... and with this on the side ... '' type of tables . so he was busy . they had a special menu that was featuring a pork tenderloin with a maple glaze that sounded really good . i did ask the server if it was a quick dish to come out and was told they were all ready out of it for the evening . which was fine ... hey , you snooze , you lose . so i ordered the goat cheese ravioli . it came out pretty quick and i was actually quite impressed with the dish . it was served with some sauteed spinach and had a handful of pine nuts tossed in . pasta , goat cheese , spinach , pine nuts ... right up my alley . do n't think they could go wrong with that for me if they tried . on the special menu they were offering a pumpkin cheesecake which sounded awfully good to me . i checked the time and i was doing pretty good so i was debating if i should get a slice . well , all of a sudden my server dropped off my check . `` whenever you 're ready '' . okay ... no dessert i guess . he picked up my empty plate and was gone . i was n't quite sure if he knew i was headed to the show like the rest of the patrons or he just wanted me gone and out of there . i did ask him about the quickness of the pork tenderloin so i 'm not sure if he just assumed i was in a hurry and was trying to help me out or what . as a whole i really hate getting my check without being offered anything else or while i 'm still eating ... but i 'll give the server the benefit of the doubt with this one . on the way out i did ask when they closed because i was thinking of coming back for the pumpkin cheesecake after the show but they closed at 10 so that would n't work . so , next time i 'm in the area i 'd like to check it out again when i have some more time . some of the menu items sounded pretty good and like i said earlier i did enjoy the atmosphere so i would like to relax and enjoy a meal there at a not so hectic time . a solid three stars ... and hopefully will bump it up with a review update when i get to visit a second time .		3		0
1st time at this place ... pretty average . i got matzoh ball soup . the matzoh ball was pretty small & pretty hard ... it should be softer . i also got a greek omelette ... it was good , pretty average . my partner got a hot pastromi sandwich ... the problem is , is that it was n't hot ! he had to return it for a hot one . and , the amount of meat was n't really a whole lot either ... it gets worse ... he got cole slaw for the side , and omg , it was served in a teeeny-tiny little plastic cup , about 1 inch in diameter ... the kind of cup that is probably used for when you want extra sauce on something . seriously now ! ... so , if he got fries instead , would the fries come in that same tiny cup ?? oh brotther ! we are willing to give this place another try ... so , another update will eventually follow ...		3		0
... weaned me off baby food with rice and beans . i 've been going to the pinata since before i could walk . my grandparents were tight with the bougarins and we ate there often . at some point -lrb- as my grandmother tells us every time we go -rrb- , pete confronted my mother and told her i should n't be eating that baby food , that i should be getting a proper start with an order of rice and beans . after that , i was hooked . for years i ordered the same thing with a roy roger -lrb- think cherry coke -rrb- . family wedding rehearsal dinners , birthdays , out of town guests , there seemed to be no reason not to choose the pinata for good mexican food . i used to sneak away from the table to play video games in the front corner of the cantina . even today , it still feels like a room that i should n't be in or even curious about . each time , our going-away treat was one of the $ 0.05 chocolate mints from the bowl on the host stand -- they are still selling the very same mints ! this place is more nostalgic for me than anything else . i have so many memories of so many family occasions celebrated there . the lobby is still decorated with colorful pinatas hanging from the ceiling and walls . mariachi music still fills the air . and the blender can still be heard in the distance , chopping fresh ice for the next margarita . as amy already correctly identified , this is the best chips and salsa in town . on recent visits the salsa has been watery , but it could easily have been that spoonful from the big container of it back in the kitchen . speaking of which , above the kitchen entrance is an old 1-10 lighted number display to alert the wait staff of orders ready to be served . i used to ask the waitress what her number was and watch for it . -lrb- not much else to do when surrounded by adult-talk . -rrb- if our guests were lingering types , we often ended up at the 31-flavors ice cream next door . it lost its franchise many years ago , no doubt caught by the inspector selling generic from the price club like so many other former franchises in this old chain . today this store is just a city signs violation , like something out of tijuana . but back to the pinata . it 's one of the valley originals . if you have n't done it , and you think you are a phoenician , you are n't one yet .		3		0
time for a review update . ever since maya opened up , we have n't come to the w as much anymore because it 's kind of lost it 's luster . it used to be a happening spot , but most of the crowd has moved on to the newer spots opened in old town . a few friends decided to have a bachelor party here and ended up spending thousands of dollars over a weekend . at the end of the weekend , we all determined that we could 've went to vegas and got much more for the dollars than we did here . room rates for the group averaged over $ 250 and drinks , food , and cabana rental pushed it up even higher . in vegas , we have hookups that could 've easily got us all that for much less . hopefully one day it returns to what it once was . return factor - 50 %		3		0
maybe lunch is n't the best time to try kitchen 56 . i thought it was just okay . the boyfriend and i stopped in for lunch on a saturday and we were literally the only customers there . but everyone was very friendly and we got our food very fast since it 's not like the kitchen was busy ! i ordered a salad and boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese . first thing we noticed was that all the dishes were chipped . each bowl had at least 3 chips on it . do they have a clumsy dishwasher ? is that the look they are going for ? not sure but it was a little off-putting to eat off of broken dishes . the salad was pretty good . not great . decent enough size but the dressing was kinda blah . boyfriend felt the same way about his mac and cheese . it was good but not great . i wish the food had been better because i liked the atmosphere and like i said the staff was very nice . i just do n't feel compelled to go back again . sorry !		3		0
they have a great happy hour , despite their not handing over the happy hour food menu unless you ask for it . it 's also highly recommended you do n't bring your spouse to the same place you bring your girlfriend . then things are n't quite so happy anymore . try the ginger bourbon lemonade . it 'll sneak up on you like a gay cellmate . three of these , an angry mistress i tried pawning off as an unpaid vendor , and a wife with a penchant for sharp cutlery does n't make for a good happy hour , let alone happy anything . the friends with benefits sushi rolls -lrb- delicious -rrb- should have been a warning bad things were headed my way . whatever type of drink my wife had smelled good on my clothes the next day . i think it was apples or something . the happy hour menu is n't fifty percent off anymore , but it is cheaper than the regular menu .		3		0
10/27/10 had i not have to wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches , i 'd easily give this meal 4 stars . looking over these photos and remembering how good these sandwiches tasted , i 'd like to visit again soon , but recalling how long my wait was , and the negative vibes that bounced off the cook -lrb- that took my order -rrb- and another whom i thought was either an owner or a manager , i am very hesitant on returning . : -lrb- i did enjoy the sandwiches , especially the cheesesteak , even though half-way through my half-sandwich , i decided it was a little too salty . i thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich , creaminess of the cheesesteak and kept me reaching for another bite of the eggplant ! loved munching on the hefty wheat roll , but i did n't care much for the soft white roll that the parm rested on .		3		0
i 'm a very picky brisket man and judge all bbq joints by the quality of what they deliver . for this reason , stacy 's only gets three stars . the brisket was not crispy , was very fatty and came in sauce . that just does n't fly with me . the sweet potatoes were quite good but had far too much sugar in them to be truly enjoyable . the green beans are highly recommended . bring cash and be prepared for a range of service from terrible to outstanding .		3		0
nothing superb , but certainly nothing bland . z ` tejas is a quality tex-mex chain that rarely disappoints . it has that bar vibe , but certainly not the scottsdale vibe that most of the restaurants in fashion square seem to be going for . my girlfriend and i were in the mall late on saturday when we realized we had n't eaten , yet . we decided on z ` tejas because the menu is filled with foods that we both like . then again , i do n't know how anyone lives in the southwest if they do n't like tex-mex . she had the turkey burger , which she enjoyed . i had the smoked chicken chile relleno . it was just okay , certainly not close to the best i 've ever had . we also had the table side guacamole and chips . awesome ! i highly recommend it to anyone . also awesome ; the corn bread z ` tejas serves with every meal . i could eat that all day ! z ` tejas is another spot inside fashion square mall that i do n't think i would ever go out of my way to eat at . but it certainly is a place you wo n't go wrong with if you happen to be in the mall and looking for a good bite to eat .		3		0
never ate here but we come here regularly for the happy hour and the scene . good group usually a fun place to people watch . tends to be a lot of attractive people lurking about . like myself . the service can be hit or miss . the 1 bartender guy who rides his bike and is bald is really the only person working there worth a dang . he knows how to take care of people . the rest are just twenty somethings that tend to spend more time hanging out in the corner talking to each other than worrying about the customers . either way we will keep coming back for $ 3 tecates .		3		0
not too shabby i guess . i was n't too impressed with the food here . i ordered the beef shawarma not too sure what it really was . the hummus was pretty good along with my pita bread . however , that was n't the main meal . the beef was pretty dry along with the dry bed of rice . needless to say , i needed some water ! i must give them kudos for the sangria . it looked pretty cloudy at first , but when you take the first sip ... oh yeah it 's good ! service is pretty good and and fast . i appreciate the belly dancing show and the floor turns into a salsa dancing fest during the evening . i 've danced here many times and it 's pretty good since there 's actually room for you to move around . however , ventilation is rough ... sweat ! - enjoy		3		0
i had higher expectations for this place based on the reviews . my son had a burger that was huge and he enjoyed it . he was excited most about the marinated onions on it . he usually hates onions and really enjoyed them that way . i did n't think the chips were that great . my girls got the kids meal chicken strips . they came out looking hand made but burned . the employee was kind enough to get us a second order but the kids still did n't like them . i had the egg sandwich and thought it was just okay . they forgot to put any cheese on it . i missed that but it still did n't excite me . they did have yoo hoo and the girls were happy about that . oh and i saw a maple bacon milkshake on the menu . lol ! ick !		3		0
i have always liked this place and find the overall ambience and food to be very enjoyable , although it 's generally very crowded around the lunch hour . i stopped here for lunch today at 12:00 pm on the dot . it was packed , very loud with about five to seven people in line . fortunately the line moved fairly quickly since i was starving . i 'm on a low carb diet , which limits my food options in general ... why i 'm having lunch at a place known for their homade bread does n't make much sense ! i must like torture !!! well , i stick to the diet and order the grilled chicken ceasar salad to go . i 've eaten this salad at leat five or six times and always enjoy the tangy dressing , freshly grated parmesean cheese and nice portion of grilled chicken , along with the addition of sauteed mushrooms . it also includes homemade croutons and two huge slices of freshly baked sourdough ! i was , again , able to avoid temptation !!! this time the salad was just not that good ... it had too much dressing , not enough lettuce and a smaller portion of chicken . i should have gone with the hummus plate which is still fairly low carb as it 's served with grilled vegetables . i have stopped here for breakfast from time to time and have really enjoyed the frittatas and breakfast sandwiches -lrb- pre low carb era -rrb- . it 's nice to be able to sit in a comfy chair and read the newspaper while enjoying the food . overall , i think wildflower is pretty good at what they do . they sure know how to pack in the crowds : -rrb-		3		0
modified as we know it now is going bye-bye . the owner , kimber lanning , is handing it over to a husband and wife duo , and the venue will be remodeled into a more traditional gallery with some smaller shows catered to progressive and experimental music . here 's the link to the article about the change ... http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2009/09/kimber_lanning_parting_ways_wi.php this is such a bummer since some of my favorite artists have played here . although there are still some good venues for indie artists , there are n't a whole lot in the downtown area . i guess all i can do now is hope that someone else will come along and start up a place like modified .		3		0
you ca n't go wrong with pizza ... if you do you probably should n't own a pizzeria or become an employee of any pizza establishment anytime soon . i love my pizzas ... hot out of the oven or straight out the frig . yeah i love cold pizza - yum ! cpk keeps it consistent and they 're always out and about trying to come up with new ideas for pizza -- bacon , bbq & ham -- please another large to go : -rrb- always packed , but spacious enough where it 's not too crowded ; i definitely appreciate the formula of cpk . plus , who does n't know what you 're talking about now when you say cpk ... okay i 'm starting to just shoot off my mouth - in any case - enjoy !		3		0
i went here the other day with a friend after reading all of the glowing reviews , but it was just ok ! sad day . the people who work here are very nice and friendly and the price really ca n't be beat , but the food was not the best i have had around the valley . we both got the buffet -lrb- of course -rrb- and it had high points and low points . i thought the lamb -lrb- or goat ? -rrb- was a little tough -lrb- usually it 's so tender from being cooked in the sauce all day ... not really the case -rrb- and the same with the chicken . the chicken tikka masala sauce was really tasty though ... got ta love that . i also liked that the buffet comes with mango lassi and chai tea ... definite plus . i did not , however , like that they brought out the tandoori chicken to every table because i do n't like tandori chicken and i felt really bad just leaving it there ... maybe they should ask first so they do n't waste their food ... anyway , the buffet is large and has a lot of variety , but the flavor just is n't as good as some other buffets ... maybe i 'll give them another shot sometime in the future , it could have just been the night ...		3		0
i 've been here twice and the average of the two visits is a 3 . the first time was an #evfn event that gave them 1 star for embarrassingly terrible service for my one margarita . this time i dined there for lunch with a group of 6 and it was a 4 ! unbelievable ! lets just start with the salsa ; the lovely , surprisingly dark addictive salsa . i recall at least 4 occasions where i inquired if it was available for take home purchase . yay once again for non tomato based salsa ! additionally i had a seafood enchilada that was to . die . for . honestly . it was just the right size for lunch and had salmon , halibut , shrimp , delicious cheese and was made with no tomato as requested . topped with green chile it had an amazing flavor that i ended up craving the rest of the day . everyone in my group was completely satisfied . even the meatloaf sandwich lunch special a coworker had looked delicious and i do n't even really like meatloaf . the service was kinda awkward , for lack of better words , but this completely made me feel better about this place . while it 's a little out of the way , i can see it becoming a work lunch spot on occasion ... and i wo n't complain and tell them about my horrid experience from before .		3		0
one of the best values in a happy hour - both food & drink are on the reduced lunch plan . fried pickles , ahi tuna salad and several big cold beers for under $ 30 including tip . me likey . the fried pickles not the sliced kind you get at hooters - these are fried whole , and they are worth the trip . vibe here is a little dive-ish , and there was a mix of families in the section furthest from the bar , off-track betters & phoenix hipsters at the bar , and plenty of non-descript folks here on the friday night i attended . i 'm a big fan of a mixed crowd , so i 'm also a big fan of armadillo .		3		0
the people who regularly patronize moto must not have jobs , or lives , or children , or pets , because if they did , they would constantly be late to everything they did , have a pissed off babysitter , and dead animals littering their house . i am extremely understanding and very forgiving , but when it takes over 45 minutes to bring me avocado rolls , when it really is n't busy , there is something way wrong . like wayyyy wrong . i had the miso soup . did n't like it . once i finally got the avocado rolls , they were really good , but i was so annoyed that i could barely enjoy them . i also had to ask several times to get my tea refilled . the location is good , my sushi was good and reasonably priced , and the decor is pretty cool , so i am going to give them three stars , but the service was so terribly slow i feel like being served by a sloth would have been more efficient .		3		0
we wanted to see what the hype was about this place , so my lady and i crawled out of bed at noon and came here for lunch . we came on a saturday afternoon , there were a few people dining in . i had the carne asada burrito and my girl had the carne asada tacos . the food was tasty , and hot . i 'm sure about how i feel about all they hoopla over this place . it was a decent place to grab a bite to eat . the horchata was good , and they sell mexican coca-cola . the price was all right , but you could definitely get carne asada at a filibertos or any of the other ` bertos for that matter that was just as tasty and for a few less dollars . * update * i received an email from the proprietor of this taco shop , he stated to me that `` if you can not see the difference in quality from us and the other `` bertos '' , maybe this is n't the place for you '' ... i 'm not sure why a restaurant owner would shoo away a guest , especially a guest who said the food was good , he was just not understanding of the hype . so if you 're like me , and think filibertos is good , keep going there , because obviously , the owner of this establishment does n't need our business		3		0
one of the bars in the south scottsdale dive-bar circuit . prankster 's is the go-to spot when day drinking at the san tropez pool just is n't enough - i usually -lrb- 100 % of the time -rrb- regret my decision to continue the festivities but always have a great time doing it ! the thing about prankster 's too is that you have to have the right mentality when going there . do n't expect one of those ` looks divey on the outside but it 's probably nice on the inside ' bars ! this is one of those bars where you can play pool , toss a game of video bags , drink 32 oz beers , catch a local live band , or just sit at the bar and wait - because ineviteably someone interesting will sit down next to you . note that i omitted the following things from that list : 1 . feeling cool wearing designer jeans 2 . feeling cool with hair product in 3 . feeling cool really at all 4 . picking up chicks 5 . impressing chicks that you 've already picked up if you live in the so sco area and do n't want to drive very far and just want to get drunk , head on down to your local prankster 's too . you 'll probably regret it in the morning but at least you 'll have a good , inexpensive time that night .		3		0
i had to go for a work function . i feel obligated to write something since it 's a restaurant and this is yelp , and i ate food . as i get older , i get less tolerant of chain food . bj 's is so prototypical , that i could n't stay for very long . the service was agitating at best ... food was sub-par . i truly hope i dont have to go back anytime soon . i gave 3 stars because some people like chain food , and this was only below average , not horrible .		3		0
good , solid slice pizza but a bit pricey . this is my second time eating here , both times were good . crust is very good , however the sauce was a bit bland this time . one other thing , i asked for tomatoes and they put raw , diced tomatoes on top -lrb- the kind you would expect on a taco -rrb- rolling off the edge of the pizza - bad idea . still , this is a step up from ray 's or barro 's if you 're in the mood for a slice . but i still think the best sliced pizza in the area is aj 's .		3		0
same goodies as the tempe location but much bigger space . this location is rather nice with lots of seating and an ambient feel . i really enjoyed my pasty but i know my parents were n't as impressed . i had the veggie rosemary chicken , yes quorn veggie chicken is the best thing ever . the pasty had veggie chicken , roasted red peppers , roasted red potatoes and some brie ; it was fantastic . we also had some pea soup , baked broccoli & cauliflower , and some oven chips . the broccoli was delicious -lrb- i have an aversion to cauliflower -rrb- and the chips were good too ; remember chips = fries , crisps = potato chips . both my parents were disappointed with their dips , the chicken pot pie came with some red wine gravy instead of chicken gravy and the chicken alfredo came with ice cold marinara , they were out of alfredo sauce . bottled beer was a little pricey . i still love me some cornish pasty .		3		0
i think the best thing about this place is the location . its a sam fox restaurant so we had high expectations but were a but disappointed . inside seating is different but bar and outside patio is much better . the young service personnel were not the friendliest and service was slow even during a wednesday afternoon at 4pm . pretzel appetizer was the best on the menu , but not sure if we would return . fox has much better restaurants than this .		3		0
i went here for dinner on a weekday . 7:45 pm . i ordered the spicy lemon grass soup -lrb- # 15 -rrb- and pad thai . the service was slow . it took forever -lrb- 20 min -rrb- to get our order in -lrb- for two ppl -rrb- the soup was served . the 4.95 portion is big enough for two . it was pretty good but not amazing . the pad thai was pretty good , served in a large portion . i definitely needed a to go box . i think this is a better lunch place , since they serve warm soup immediately during lunch hours free of charge . i 'll try lunch next time .		3		0
maybe a 3.5 , but i 'm pretty sure it 's not a 4 . ordered spring rolls , pot stickers and pork fried rice -lrb- yes i know it 's a pho shop , just was n't up to that today -rrb- . spring rolls . not bad but kind of rubbery tasting . the pork inside was good . the shrimp kind of flavorless . the peanut sauce it came with was so so . pot stickers were good . the dipping sauce was very good . would have rather had that with spring rolls . pork fried rice was good but not remarkable . on the other hand is fried rice ever remarkable ?		3		0
stayed here over the summer . it was not my first time staying here but it was a very mixed experience . i came with my dog in the arizona 100 plus weather . they have no pet fee but guests with pets have to stay in the casitas . the room was a fine typical upscale hotel room with nice big separate bath tub and sliding glass doors to a grass area perfect for letting the dog out . sadly there were no public trash cans to clean up after the dog so every time he went i had to find some service person and give them the baggy and ask them to dispose of it for me : -lrb- so next thing is i checked in and was told i could n't use the valet bc my room was too far away . in the area where my room was they had no more parking spaces and i was instructed to park in a fire lane . i know better than to just do this and expect to find my car no problem so i had to start calling looking for over flow parking or to get done kind of sign or placard to put on my car to make sure it would stay and not be towed . it was a huge ordeal and i 'm not sure why i was n't sent to an over flow parking area or just valeted until a space became available . the biggest complaint is i got in and checked in with my dog , who i told them was coming when i made my reservation . at check in i asked to make sure there would be a bed and dishes for him in the room . in the arizona summer , especially for a dog not used to it water is very important right away and in our long car ride down from la his water intake was limited . i was told they would send the dishes and bed . i got down to the room and after waiting 20 min called again . i was giving my dog water from one of the bathroom cups and it was not the most effective way for him to get water . when i called once again i was told right away . i told them i really wanted to get some dinner but was concerned about feeding the dog and giving him water so they offered to bring the dishes in and give him the water and feed him for me . i headed off to the restaurant for some dinner after a long day in the car and took my time bc i believed they were taking care of my dog . when i got back to the room still no dishes but there was a bed at the door . that was it . i was n't calling agsin and i walked back up to the main building and waited on line to speak to a live person . i told them if they could n't supply dishes they should have told me and i would have packed my own . they explained they had too many dogs on property and would have to search their villas for dishes . i told them i needed something asap and a cereal bowl would be fine if they had no dishes . i was offered for my dinner to be comped or to get starwood points but this is my pets health and safety not just a customer service issue do while i appreciated it i ca n't say it made it ok . i finally got 1 dog dish shortly after but not 2 . i was told in the morning i could get a second . i left for the day and when i returned in the evening instead of leaving me a second dish they had swapped the dish for a chewed up plastic one . are you serious ??? the shops all seemed to close early and open late which was a bummer too . the hotel is very nice but the parking and pet services are disappointing . i ca n't say i dealt with anyone who was n't delightful but some pretty small requests were overwhelming to them and could n't get done adequately which at a hotel of this level is unacceptable .		3		0
update : this was originally a 4.5 star review , but you will see and i hope understand why i 've downshifted to three stars soon enough ... i really want to give two stars , since there are a few people that should be held accountable for not giving clearer warnings about this abhorrence to their customers ... what are your opinions on the matter ? -- staff is always friendly and helpful . potted orchids are plentiful and varied - this goes for both the orchid types and the pots they 're contained in . bought four potted orchids , a purple-blue cupcake -lrb- ? -rrb- plant ** , a pot containing three types of herbs -lrb- thyme , rosemary , and oregano , including a recipe for bbq herb chicken ! -rrb- , and a cinnamon broom , all for $ 66 plus tax . i wish tj 's would also offer organic plants , and no , you wo n't find organic potting soil here ! -lrb- nor will you find the alternative - neonicotinoid/pesticide-tainted potting soils - for that matter . -rrb- please offer more organic nut/snack selections , corn-free bagels and breads , as well as bring back your organic almond butters ! ** tried to search for this plant 's name -lrb- since `` cupcake '' was not turning up anything useful -rrb- , but could n't make a quick id based on online images , so instead looked up code 6830-25 i found stuck onto the plastic pot . imagine my surprise and huge disappointment to find this result pop up at the very top of the results page - http://www.pesticideinfo.org/list_products.jsp?rec_id=pc33044&chem_name=warfarin&pc_code=086002&offset=800 . to learn that i 've unwittingly introduced `` known or probable carcinogens , reproductive or developmental toxicants , cholinesterase inhibitors , known groundwater contaminants or acutely toxic poisons '' into my car and home simply by purchasing this product from trader joe 's is appalling ! needless to say , i will be returning it very shortly and asking for my money back . seeing the care directions tab include the warning `` unlicensed propagation prohibited '' gave me pause and made me think of the devil monsanto , and so i went online to do some research , and voila ! i 'm now trying to decide if i should return the other plants -lrb- my beautiful orchids ! -rrb- , as well ... so sad right now . : -lrb- i guess i should acquire some organic potting soil and get those organic tulip bulbs i bought online started ...		3		0
there 's been a long search far and wide for a phoenix area breakfast brunch , and this was one of the places we 've been eyeing for awhile . we figured anything that includes crab and shrimp on their menu had to be a pretty legit buffet , especially when you just dropped $ 500 to stay the night at royal palms resort . there are several options for the buffet . it starts at 10am . the website said that for $ 33 a person you get the buffet which included the seafood , omelet station , assorted pastas , salads , and desserts . i honestly thought there would be a meat carving station , but alas ! there was not . if you get buffet option 2 , you can have the buffet for $ 23 plus the price of a regular entree item . the waiter explained this to me 3 times . possibly even 4 times ... almost to the point , where i wanted to say , `` okay ! okay ! i get it !!! '' he sensed my frustration and said that there had been misunderstandings before and he just wanted to make it clear . i understand too ... my hubby were wearing workout type clothes since we had stayed the night on a whim and should 've brought nicer attire for this brunch i guess ... regardless , my hubby did option 1 , the regular buffet , while i did option 2 that was the buffet plus an entree . the item that made option 2 worth it to me was the red velvet french toast . i absolutely adored this dish . of course , it was sweet as sweet can be . the chocolate and maple syrup that came with this french toast just made it `` all the more decadent . '' had i known that i 'd love this dish so much , i would 've gotten breakfast option # 3 ... entree only . the buffet itself was okay . things i thoroughly enjoyed : mini flatbread pizza margheritta type slices drizzled with a balsamic ? vinegarette . buffalo chicken , blue cheese , and celery salad . very clever take on football appetizer on the day of the superbowl , the morning we ate there ! omelet station - overall pretty good . but even though the menu bragged prosciutto as one of the omelet items - it was not available , so i went for ham ... panna cotta dessert - rich and perfect texture tiramisu - good stuff pistachio dessert - it was n't a cake but it was n't a mousse either . it was hard to explain but perfection in every way ! we did not like the crab and shrimp station . the crab and shrimp had no flavor whatsoever , not even a seafood one . i might as well have been eating lumpy ice . maybe that was the flavor ? freezer burn perhaps ? i did n't even eat the shrimp ceviche either , because it seemed like the same crab and shrimp served plain . usually i love crab and shrimp . there 's a crab and seafood buffet in portland , oregon called salty 's that practically killed me because i swear i 've eaten nearly 4-5lbs in crab alone , so trust me ! i am not that picky about crab and shrimp . we were just so sad that it was so plain , especially at a 4 1/2 -5 star resort .		3		0
this restaurant screams expensive with decked out lighted floors , gorgeous lighting and a lovely dinning room . however it is not as great as the ambience it tries to provide . i ordered a filet mignon and i think it was good but not amazing . the salad i had with artichoke to start was good . the mixed drink i ordered was so so . i had to add honey since i did n't think it was sweet enough . the staff is very attentive and the portions are huge . expect to pay $ 100 a person if you all get a starter , entree , drink , and share a dessert . i found the potatoes au gratin to be terrible . way too cheezy i almost died . the spinach side was okay but sour . i would come back but skip the butter cafe , the mixed drink , and coffee . also it is $ 6 to valet which i find to be not horrible since parking at scottsdale quarter is hard to find .		3		0
i came to cadillac ranch on a friday evening to celebrate with a friend who just eloped in las vegas ! i met his lovely new bride on the patio of cadillac ranch , which sits above the people shopping below at tempe marketplace . people were smoking , which somewhat irritated my allergies , but i ca n't complain , since it 's technically outdoors . when i asked the young , energetic bartender what the specials were during happy hour , she happily recited a long list of bargains including domestic and imported beers , wine , margaritas and cocktails ! the prices were fair and average for a happy hour at tempe marketplace . we also ordered chips and salsa to snack on with our beverages . the chips were fresh and tasty , as was the flavorful salsa . the appetizer also came with a small bowl of warm queso cheese with some meat crumbles sprinkled on top . i cheated on my vegan-ism and scooped some cheese onto a chip ... yum ! it was pretty good ! overall i was impressed with the prompt service , knowledgeable staff and open environment . it was the perfect evening to catch a breeze and watch the crowd below , while enjoying good company and good food at a perfectly good bar .		3		0
this is my first exposure to scottsdale nightlife . i came here right after spending about 1 hour at dirty pretty . the good part of it was that i was no longer at dirty pretty -lrb- god i hate nightclubs -rrb- so i was actually excited to be in a regular bar , order a cocktail and chill by the bar . yeah right . although it looks like a bar , it still very much behaves like a nightclub . the bar has a wheel where , after you climb on top to spin it , you get to do whatever shot is shown there or whatever ` action ' is there as well . the 3 girls i was with managed to do blowjob shots and push ups all while wearing a micro cocktail dress -lrb- is it really a dress if it barely covers your crotch ? -rrb- and matching platform hooker heels . granted i felt a little out of place for being the only girl wearing jeans , or the only girl with naturally brown hair , or the only girl not wearing 5lbs of makeup . damn scottsdale ... your girls are high maintenance . the guys there were pretty much in ` hunting ' mode too . one accidental look-in-the-eyes and they swore you desperatelty wanted them . sorry , i 'm not into popped collars and i do n't like the fact that your wear more gel than i do , or any , for that matter , but thanks ! the drinks prices are standard-high -lrb- but then again its scottsdale so you should know better -rrb- , but i still recommend this place rather than many of the nightclubs in the area because it has a rather big open seating/terrace where you can escape from sweaty men and armani exchange cologne and attempt to have a good time . aaaaand , despite me being ridiculously mean about this place , i did have a good time -lrb- but then again , who does n't when you are drinking heavily , right ? -rrb- ; -rrb-		3		0
i 've always had mixed feelings about the paisley violin -- i really want to like it more . there is a lot to like here : decent beer selection , local art hosted all around , outside eating areas . i went last week for a friend 's birthday shindig . i had the chicken schwarma , which was ok . and perhaps that is what is missing for me at paisley , the food was just `` meh '' and the service was not outstanding either . it 's on my list for trying out more often and perhaps i will be more impressed .		3		0
armed with a $ 30 local dines gift certificate -lrb- http://bit.ly/dfr4eq -rrb- , i went here last night for dinner with a party of 4 . it was the 13th of the month which is the day of the month when they have extra super deals on certain things . for example a few entrees were $ 13 and your second bottle of wine is 13 cents . it was pretty busy and loud but we were seated right away and our waitress was fast and friendly . food was also delivered relatively quickly . all the other tables around us were offered bread to start but we were n't asked and none was given to us which ticked me off . we ordered a bottle of wine and a 2nd because , hey it 's only 13 cents . then , for an appetizer we shared the calamari . it was very good and perfect to share even though i could have eaten it all myself . i loved the spicy sauce stuff . i ordered the wedge salad for myself and it was not very good . well , it could have been very good had the thing not been warm . they must of had the lettuce and other toppings out of the fridge for a few hours . bummer . for my main entree i ordered the burger and it was excellent . i loved the toppings and the burger itself was cooked perfectly . i ordered the plain fries and they were just ok . nothing special . i should have ordered the sweet potato fries or chips instead . the only thing that seriously pissed me off was that our waitress refused to honor my gift certificate . i was going to start a fight , but i was with friends and did n't want to be rude . instead i 'm taking to yelp to vent my frustrations . anyway , i sort of understand why i can not use a coupon for happy hour stuff or a 13 cent bottle of wine . what i do n't understand is why i ca n't use my gift certificate for the other 80 % of the bill which came from full price items ? i 've purchased about 20 gift certificates over the years from local dines -lrb- http://bit.ly/dfr4eq -rrb- and this was the only place to give me a problem . so , while i do highly recommend getting one , be prepared for a fight . all-in-all it was a good meal and a solid neighborhood spot . if i lived closer i might give it another shot , but the food and service are n't good enough for me to make the 15 minute drive .		3		0
since everyone in my family digs tandoori times , i 've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and , honestly , i 'm a little underwhelmed . definitely not bad or awful , but maybe if i sandwiched a later supper between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of kingfishers , i 'd stumble out with a hazier -lrb- and happier -rrb- overall impression . nothing i 've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit . portions tend to be small and sauces are , by and large , mild and rather one dimensional . other than the garlic naan , i cant remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by , which is a shame considering indian cuisine is among the world 's most aromatic . i was eager to share yesterday 's lamb boti kabob , as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb -lrb- not mega kabob sized cubes , but a very respectable portion for $ 10-11 -rrb- , on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers . the lamb exterior was nice & crusty , but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you 'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard , chewy and disappointing . companion 's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce , that looked more like an appetizer . chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good , and similar to most indian joints . i recommend the three hot relishes -lrb- red sauce , green puree , and pickled peppers -rrb- provided tableside , as house preparations , at least in my experience , tend to be mild . servers are generally anglo , pleasant and competent during the meal , but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30 , the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence . nobody 's overtly rude , but instead of a really warm welcome , you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you , as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening . it 's not oppressive , but it 's happened more than once and i 'm not crazy about the vibe . i do like the complimentary , self serve chai tea and open kitchen , providing an opportunity to stretch one 's legs and socialize a bit . nice touches . the menu is extensive , all told about sixty items , and reasonably priced for indian food . indian textiles , jewelry and artwork is often on display , for sale , and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker . it got turned down , eventually , but any restaurant with a few years under it 's belt ought to understand customary american tolerances better than that . the atmosphere is up and down . food 's ok . service is ok . ask my family and they 'll each give it four or five stars . in my book , tandoori times is just ok .		3		0
first , let me say the food here is good . if you are looking for a bite and you happen to be in the area go check zinburger out . our waitress was enthusiastic -lrb- especially about the dessert we ordered -rrb- and she kept my water glass full , which i really appreciate - that 's present tense on purpose . i drink a lot of water . however , the decor just does n't fit ... it 's bright , and the booth we sat in was comfortable ... somehow , though , there 's a lack . it needs a touch more masculinity , a bit of grit , to really strike that burger joint chord . i have to add that sitting at the bar instead of a booth improves the ambience . also , the veggie burger , add avocado and pepperjack , sub ketchup and mustard for aoli , is something i crave on occasion . and i love that they offer discounted to-go options during the movies in the grass . spring and fall the biltmore shows movies out on the quad . if you have n't been , grab a blanket , call in your dinner order and get out to play !		3		0
there 's an unexplainable culinary phenomenon that 's probably happened to each and every one of us , a sandwich for whatever reason always tastes better when someone else makes it . i 'm not sure how or why this happens . if you ask around many have already formulated a various theories . some feel it 's the way the condiments are layered amongst the slices of meat and cheese . others think that it 's a secret ingredient that maker uses like a dash of celery salt or paprika . my mom used to make me a sandwich of sliced turkey , muenster cheese , miracle whip , bread and butter pickles on wonder bread . i 've made this sandwich so many times but have never been able to make it taste as good as hers . i recently tested this out at breadcrafters bakery and cafe in paradise valley where they specialize in fresh bakes breads , house made salads and of course sandwiches made by someone else . breadcrafters is n't your ordinary sandwich shop , as the name indicates they also bake bread and pastries , but oh the bread ! for me this is one of the best bread bakeries in a town that only has a handful of really good bread makers . to celebrate such amazing bread , why not make amazing sandwiches ? nancy 's favorite -lrb- $ 7.75 -rrb- arrived piled high with roast beef , gorgonzola and roasted onion spread , roasted red peppers , lettuce and tomato on a crusty baguette . aside form the chewy flavorful baguette and the tender roast beef , the bold and creamy notes of the cheese spread makes this sandwich a stack-of-love . by contrast the turkey jack stack -lrb- $ 7.75 -rrb- had a spicy bite thanks to pepper jack cheese and red onion . the sourdough bread it was served on was so spongy and flavorful i ordered a loaf -lrb- $ 4.50 -rrb- to go . unfortunately the park avenue chicken salad -lrb- $ 7.75 -rrb- was under-seasoned ; its only saving grace was the incredible raisin walnut pecan bread it was served on . on my next visit , ill just pick up a loaf -lrb- $ 4.50 -rrb- of the bread and skip the salad . when you order a sandwich you have your choice of potato salad , pasta salad , fruit , coleslaw or potato chips . i might avoid the disappointing potato salad . the potatoes were oven roasted which is great but the spuds were over cooked and dehydrated making for a chewy strange tasting mess . the love does n't stop at their bread ; they make cupcakes that are moist and inviting . on my last visit i picked up a red velvet cupcake -lrb- $ 2.75 -rrb- and a strawberry shortcake cupcake -lrb- $ 2.75 -rrb- . on my way back home i could n't stop thinking about the cute little white box housing my treats . once home , dessert came first ! the shortcake cupcake was n't shortcake at all but made from angel food cake , then topped with real whipped cream and a glazed strawberry . this was one of those desserts you savor and enjoy though i ended up eating the whole thing in about four bites , yes it was that good . wiping the crumbs from my face i proceeded to convince myself that i would only have a single bite of the red velvet , wrong . i could n't resist licking the cream cheese frosting off before devouring the moist and ultra chewy cake . while there is still no concrete reason why a sandwich made by someone else 's hand is better , i do know this , i enjoyed trying to prove this one out .		3		0
a coworker brought me here about a month ago and i was genuinely surprised when i walked into this place . it was pretty clean and colorful in everything you expect from a traditional mexican restaurant in the valley . plus , they had individual la rosa candy for sale at the register . they could accommodate our group of 8 pretty easily at lunchtime and although service was pretty slow , it was a decent experience . i think i had red cheese enchiladas and was pleased enough with the flavors that my husband and i returned here this past weekend . it was early sunday afternoon and there were a handful of people in the restaurant . we were sat in the booth in the far corner by the server station ; where the seat is pretty well worn and the vibration from some nearby machine rattles your back . we asked to be moved to a booth by the window ; this time i scored the good seat and my husband got the lumpy one -lrb- score -rrb- . chips are hot -lrb- charge : $ 1 -rrb- and salsa is pretty good . his machaca plate order inspired me to get machaca red enchiladas this time . the machaca was pretty drippy with oil/water and it flooded my plate so i sent it back for some posole - there was really no saving the plate . i understand it 's mexican food and greasy but it was a little more than norm . our extremely nice server that reminded me of my tia was gracious and gave me a squinted eye `` i agree '' when i kindly made the request . the posole was downright tasty - and pretty meaty - a very thick red chile broth that was more stew like , nice texture on the hominy and served with lemon and minced green onion . it had a nice kick to it . overall , it was a solid 3-star experience .		3		0
meh . i was n't very impressed with the bagel . the crust was crispy but was way too flakey . it actually almost tasted like a croissant . they did a good job of toasting it though so that the cream cheese melted just right . they do n't have a case full of salads , which as we all know is how i measure a bagel shop , nor do they offer whitefish salad which is a staple . you must offer it to be considered legit . the service was quick , they have a pretty good system going on . the place was packed with people -lrb- i did n't notice age or anything because i mean honestly , it 's a bagel shop . who cares ? -rrb- on a saturday morning . they only really have fountain drinks , they do have snapple diet raspberry iced tea and kiwi strawberry but that 's it . how do you not stock regular snapple iced tea if you 're stocking snapple ? hell , my junior high 's cafeteria stocked it . this is a 3.5 , had they stocked regular snapple i would have given them a 4 .		3		0
food was good but the service ... meh . considering the location -lrb- across the street from eddie matney 's -rrb- they really need to step it up . i do n't think i need to describe the food as it was all the standard fare you 'd get at every other mexican restaurant in town so i wo n't detail it . it was flavorful and was served hot though so that 's a plus . the service . . well , it was just kind of indifferent . our server did n't greet us , did n't seem interested in serving us , and was about as indifferent as someone can be who is working in the service industry and earns tips . i was rather surprised given that this is scottsdale and you really do need to work a little to earn a tip . i 'll go back because the food was good enough for a second visit so i hope that our visit was a fluke on the service side of things .		3		0
i 'm a little torn on this place . the food was good but a tad overpriced although it is in an upscale area , so you are paying up for the area it is in . we had a couple of kids with our group and no kids menu . the beer and food list was good and prices were reasonable . i would n't come just for the beer or wine though . we also had to ask a couple of times for little things , like sugar for the iced tea and spoons so service was just so so .		3		0
yeah , so it was time i finally tried zinburger . we arrived around 8:00 pm and the dining room was full and very noisy . for those with hearing problems , this is not good . however , they do have a nice patio seating wrapping around the building and the outside seats were heated with ir heaters from above - that turned a cold evening into an enjoyable one . our server was young and hip , pressing us immediately to order something . we started with beverages and i really wanted to have a stella , but they were out . oh , well , i chose a pint of left hand polestar pilsner instead and it was n't too bad . the pour was a little lame , as there was no head , but it had a crisp , refreshing taste . the server seemed a little upset that i did n't want water with my beer , but i thought it was an odd thing to offer - i 'm not sure what to do with it when i 'm already drinking beer , so i declined . the wife had a glass of santa christina sangiovese and seemed to enjoy it . of course , the younger generation was relegated to water . i had the samburger , the wife had the zinburger , daughter had the buffalo chix sandwich and bf had a zinburger with jalepenos . my burger was cooked a perfect medrare , was juicy and flavorful and came with two cold , limp bacon strips hanging over the edges . some disassembly was required as the bacon , while an interesting presentation -lrb- x -rrb- had to be rearranged to actually be eaten with the burger . i also had to add some salt and pepper to really bring out the flavors of this sandwich . bun was soft and fresh and the burger is served ala-carte with a garnish of three pickles . we ordered a side of fries to go with all this , and it was a pretty typical side of fries , crispy and potato-tasting . the wife exclaimed that this was the best burger she has had in a while and considered that it might even be better than delux . i was not that impressed , although it is a good burger . the kids were too busy eating to comment , and they are uniformly embarrassed by my constant asking what they think of their meals and the picture-taking . the service was not intrusive , however , the server did fail to check back after delivery to make sure all was well . the kids finished it off by splitting a mint-chip milkshake and they both agreed it was good .		3		0
really , i would give this place 3.5 stars . it is a great , relaxing place to spend a cool day . do not go when it is hot - you will be miserable and so are the animals . overall , this is a pretty standard , older zoo . what distinguishes it , though , is the amazing desert backdrops . the best areas of the zoo are those that reflect the local landscape , especially the big horn sheep area dramatically set against papago peak . as an aside , the kettle corn made on site is really good as well . if you want a salty-sweet snack , this is the way to go .		3		0
i have been looking forward to checking this place out since it opened in phoenix . the atmosphere was exactly what i expected , chic yet laid back . it 's right next to where they have the ice rink set up for ice skating and the massive christmas tree so it was a great view from the bar . the server was friendly and fast . i had the deep water cocktail ... i did n't realize it was spicy so i was n't really expecting that , but it was pretty good . also got an order of the dumplings which were exactly what you 'd expect , nothing over the top . sushi we had a house roll and something basic , both were good and again ... supah fast ! location is great as i mentioned , but the parking was meh . had to park and walk a bit which can really suck in 4in heels . if i 'm in the area i will absolutely stop in again because it was an overall good experience , just did n't knock the ball outta the park ? know wadda mean ? : -rrb-		3		0
i lik marcella 's , i really do . marcella 's reminds me of my shameful visits to starbucks . i 'm not opposed to either , do n't get me wrong , but chains that get it right are a very scary thing to me . it 's easy to hate a chain when their food sucks and their prices are n't that great , but that is not the case with marcella 's . from their bruscetta , pizza , cheese plate to their reasonable drink prices , marcellas is getting it right . although the cheese plate did n't come with a knife . i had to `` cut the cheese '' with a butter knife . after asking for a sharper tool , i was given a serrated steak knife ... lame . one thing that must be experienced is their bathroom soap , it may be the best soap in the world . reminds me of the pumice soap at my buddies dad 's auto-shop as a kid . uberclean !		3		0
picked up filled croissants for myself and the boys this morning . they were a little overbaked today but still tasty . i still miss the original place that was i 'm the strip mall a couple suites down . price has increased twice , at least , for individual croissants since it changed ownership . quality of croissants has not improved and if anything it seems to have gone from alright to mediocre . sometimes lacking filling , sometimes looking especially small - c'mon , for the price you do n't want something that 's a tad bigger than a grocery store cinnamon fry . i rather they would get rid of all the new flavors they 've added and simply offer a better quality product that was brought over from the original store/owner/baker -lrb- s -rrb- . because the price of one croissant has gone up again i have opted to pick up treats to deliver to friends or a business -lrb- the staff at my vets office -rrb- from an excellent bakery that 's across town . more options and more for my money too .		3		0
i stopped here with some friends after getting some drinks up the road at chilleens . we all ordered different pieces of pie . the pie was good , but nothing special to classify it `` world famous . '' i also had a cup of coffee with my pie . the coffee tasted like safeway select coffee . which is expected at small cafes and diners . the waitress was very nice and even gave me a fresh brewed cup after realizing the coffee was not fresh . the place is a tourist spot . they have a couple different things to see in that area . including a fake graveyard and an alligator made out of a tire . nice little spot to stop and see , but i ca n't see myself ever stopping here again .		3		0
my husband and i were looking for a good place to have friday night date night at , after my haircut . we yelped around and saw this place and decided to check it out . it 's a rather standard suburban sushi place in the arrowhead area . we got there about 8-9 pm that night , and the place was almost empty . service was prompt and efficient , and we were seated quickly with menus in our hands . the drink selection was ... okay . i got the watermelon martini , which was good , but truthfully nothing to write home about . i ordered some tempura udon , and the shrimp tempura was crispy and fresh , but the broth a bit too high on the sodium content . the sushi rolls we got were nice , but not immensely creative . well made though , with decent fish . i did ask to order my favorite - ikura nigiri , and they unfortunately did n't have it . i got ebiko nigiri instead , at her suggestion . not my favorite , but a decent substitute . fish eggs are fish eggs . the one noteworthy thing that i did enjoy was that they had a good number of rolls with ` white tuna ' , or escarole . my husband and i love it . but if you do your research and google it you will know that it does n't always agree with everyone , especially if eaten in large quantities . so reader beware - you may not have a nice reaction to it , and really that differs from individual to individual . neither myself or my husband have ever had a reaction , and we enjoy eating it every time we see it in on a menu . overall - 3.5 stars , rounded down to 3 . a nice place , but really , nothing to go out of your way to enjoy .		3		0
this was rated best eggs benedict . i unfortunately can not agree only because the price was just outrageous ! $ 16 ! the location was about 20 miles away from down town phoenix located in a ritzy dirt road area that was fairly easy to find . the interior seemed upper class mid 90 's . the waiter was attentive and the sticky buns served as appetizers were just as appealing as they were delicious . would only recommend if the price was lower and the location was n't a day drive .		3		0
we went here recently to celebrate my fiances new job and to use a groupon i had purchased a while ago . as it was voted one of the top ten sushi restaurants in america by bon apetit , i was very excited to try it . the ambiance was lively and the decor was modern , but i was expecting more of a dim lighting , romantic type setting so i was a little surprised . as for the food , unfortunately i think this place was way over hyped for its sushi at least . what we ordered : rock shrimp - big portion but nothing really special . batter was a little heavier than i prefer for tempura , with a side of spicy mayo it was an okay appetizer . butterfish tataki - this was tasty , butterfish melts in your mouth and the sauce -lrb- ponzu ? -rrb- complemented the fish well . but such a tiny portion : -lrb- hamachi serrano roll - big chunks of hamachi but in a rather small roll , definitely not enought to fill one person up . it was okay . black cod - probably my favorite item of the night . nice big portion of cod , miso marinade was apparent in every bite . melts in your mouth good . my only gripe is that the skin of the fish melted on to the leaf that they smoke it in so you ca n't eat it . the skin is the best part !! size and price wise its comparable to roy 's butterfish , except roy 's gives you a side of rice with their dish . uni nigiri - sweet and good portion . sake salmon nigiri - i did n't think you could ruin this but ours was served warm and oily . so weird , it did not taste like sake salmon at all , maybe we will get the regular salmon next time . ikura nigiri - fiance had this and said he was pleased , seemed like a generous portion too . buttercream cake with raspberry sherbet - free with yelp check in ! the cake was not too sweet and the sour raspberry sherbet went well with it . the waiter also brought me another dessert , must have misheard me but i think it was a rum cake with tons of walnuts and pecans . the cake was good but i do n't like nuts so i ca n't say i enjoyed it much . after a bottle of sapporo , 50 off with the groupon , and tip the bill came out to about 75 bucks . we will probably be back for happy hour and to try their steaks and lamb but i did n't think the sushi was anything special . it was definitely fresh but for the price i think i can definitely find better options out here . i 'm a fan of sushi room in chandler although i think they are also on the pricier side .		3		0
a friend and i stopped in on saturday night . until tonight i had only ever sat at the bar for their mojitos and the occasional appetizer during happy hour . i really did n't know what to expect from the food and i was curious to find out . we were greeted and seated quickly in their large dining area . i found it strange that they had a football game being projected on the wall behind us . i can understand this in the bar area but in the main dining area ? -lsb- this seems to be the `` thing '' in az center ... drawing people in with the tvs . the folks at brick told me a story this week about a night where they lost like 15 customers because their tvs were not working and showing the game . -rsb- anyway ! we chatted and studied the menu . our server was very attentive and patient as it took us a bit to order our drinks and then our meal . i ordered the shrimp fettuccine alfredo and my friend had the mediterranean pasta . we both decided on the cesar salad to start the meal . the dressing on the cesar was light enough but even at that it was a bit heavy on what seemed to be dijon . now i am a fan of mustard but this was a bit much for a cesar , it did n't make it inedible though . the servings of our main course were substantial . the shrimp were large and well prepared . while not the best i ever had where alfredo sauce is concerned , i was very pleased with the quality of the dish as a whole . my friend was quite pleased with his dish and finished every bite . i found the cheese bread served with the dish to be `` different '' it was sweet like a honey butter with a mixed yellow and white cheese melted on top -lrb- colby jack calico cheese ? -rrb- . again i found it to be `` off '' but not inedible . i would have been more pleased with a more simple toasted garlic bread . i did bring home more than half of my meal as leftovers for later . while i will say that i could give this place 4 stars it would be mostly due to the proximity to where i live . the food and ambiance have the potential to be 4-5 stars , there is still room for improvement . i still have to say it is as good or better than kincaid 's . -lsb- a fellow downtown restaurant maybe going for a slightly more formal presentation than 1130 , they are pretty similar in style . -rsb- the projection tv in the dining area , tends to cheapen the experience and does n't match . keep the tvs in the bar or if the customers are demanding the tvs then expand the bar ... * sigh *		3		0
there was an elephant in the room , and it was on the table across from me . having attended last years ' pupusa festival i was stoked to find salvadoreno # 3 about five minutes away from my office . i decided to grab a quick lunch one day , but sadly salvadoreno had other plans in mind . i walked in to a completely empty restaurant . as i took a seat i noticed a needs-to-be-cleaned table across from me . a half eaten pupusa taunted me from a dirty plate . the lunch menu was reasonably priced , with several choices . i chose the pollo catracho , fried chicken with plantain chips and various other goodies . an iced tea sounded good so that was ordered as well . the tea was brought out . it was tasty but there were only three tiny ice cubes in it . lukewarm tea is not that appealing . then i waited ... and waited ... and waited ... as i sat there in a completely empty restaurant i wondered if anyone would notice me grabbing the half eaten pupusa off of the unclean table . i also wondered why no one had cleaned the table . after more than 30 minutes my food arrived . it was freshly made and delicious . still , i had to slam it down in order to get back to work . and that damn pupusa was still there ! to sum up : - great food - great prices - really slow service - clean tables ! i 'll definitely go back to salvadoreno based on the food alone , though i 'd be hesitant to go during my lunch hour .		3		0
over the past few months , we have been on a search for the best red velvet cupcake -lrb- or something similar to a cupcake -rrb- in town . sadly , we did not find it at nothing bundt cakes . do n't get me wrong ; it was okay , but it did n't even come close to the quality and taste that we experienced with tammie coe 's red velvet cupcake . i think we got spoiled by having her cupcake first , because all of the other variations have failed to impress us as much , if at all . there were two major problems with the bundt that we tried here : first , it was too heavy . maybe that 's just the nature of the bundt itself , but we found it to be way too heavy and rich , which only allowed us to eat about half of the thing . two : it did n't have a lot of flavor . i know that might sound contradictory to my last statement about it being rich , but just because something is rich and heavy does n't automatically mean that it has a lot of flavor , which this dessert clearly did n't have . it was missing that `` wow '' factor , that melt in your mouth so good you want another one , type of feeling that we get with tc cupcakes . i 'm glad we tried it once so that we can scratch it off our list of places to try , but i really doubt that we will be going back for any more bundt 's . oh well , on to the next place ! p.s. any suggestions for a place to try red velvet cupcakes -lrb- or bundt 's -rrb- are welcome !		3		0
not a fan of the club scene in general - being that i hate lines , do n't dance unless at gunpoint , avoid cover charges , do n't care for standing shoulder to shoulder all night wishing i could sit down , or fighting to get overpriced cocktails . however this trip to myst was much different . we had a large group and a private table . easy to get in , drinks were flowing -lrb- though a little pricey -rrb- , music was good -lrb- atb -rrb- , and overall i had a really good time . my only real complaint was the `` gang '' of dirt bag bouncer/doormen that `` greet '' you on the way in . they are not good for business ... -lrb- i do understand bouncers are necessary , just save the attitude for the drunken douches that require you to be there in the first place -rrb- did i dance ? no comment ...		3		0
3.5 stars . i like four peaks . its an acceptable destination in tempe for me . they have above-average bar food -lrb- with slightly above average bar food prices -rrb- and obviously good beer . i 'm a fan of 8th street ale -lrb- aptly named after the street the brewery is on -rrb- and the peach . they had this amazing seasonal pumpkin porter this winter ... * le sigh * so . delicious . and the salmon blt is a contender for my `` last meal on earth '' . the beer battered fries are delicious as well and even their side salad is unusually tasty for you know , a simple side salad . i do n't come here very often since it 's a bit of a drive for me from phoenix but when i do stop by its during the workweek around 6-9 . not sure what the scene is like on weekend , i 'd imagine it gets lively what with all the alcohol and sporting events being broadcast on the many tv 's hanging inside . the wait staff has always been prompt and friendly . the clientele is usually pretty diverse mix of tempe folks . usually very spirited , which is not really what i look for in a drinking establishment but by no means bad and at the very least entertaining . i get annoyed that every time i come to this place they analyze my id for like 3 minutes and usually ask for alternate forms of id . i understand it 's a necessary precaution , really , i do , but its still annoying . reckon i should update the photo on my id huh . i mention it just to give a heads up if your photo id is looking less than accurate . this is a good place to come with a group of friends though . a great spot to get a feel for tempe .		3		0
i was in this store a couple days ago because i needed to purchase some wine and beer for a party . well , as usual when i come here i ended up going way overboard and filled up my cart with a ton of wine bottles . hey , i have a wine fridge at home that was starting to get a little empty looking . i do n't really think their prices are that fantastic but they do have an awesome selection . i really like the fact that they have some pretty detailed descriptions of the lesser known wines , too . unfortunately , when i got home from my shopping trip and looked at the receipt , i realized that one of the bottles appeared twice . it was the most expensive one , a $ 30 châteauneuf-du-pape , so i knew i had not purchased two of them . i double checked my count and then resolved to return the next day . my husband did n't think i would get my money back since i would not have any proof . that got me a little upset to think that maybe i had been cheated and that this was some kind of scam they were running but i decided to be positive and assume that it was an honest mistake . when i arrived at the store the next day , a very friendly employee at the customer service desk offered to help me right away . to my surprise , they actually take video surveillance of each checkout lane . i guess that is probably standard in a lot of stores these days . anyway , after very quickly verifying that i was indeed overcharged , she provided me with a refund . she apologized several times and was very nice about the whole thing . it made me feel good that she recognized that it was an inconvenience for me to have to come all the way back to the store . my experience with her pretty much canceled out my annoyance at the clerk 's mistake or any other negative feelings on my part . i will continue to shop at this store in the future . ; 0 -rrb-		3		0
kudos first : great beer and wine . super fun , energetic and cozy scene . mega plus for allowing puppy dogs on the patio ! i love enjoying happy hour or a late night chat here with a drink in hand and fellow urbanite at my side . on the edible side , i have n't been enthralled with the food . i ca n't say i 've had anything that tasted awful , was n't cooked all the way thru , or had some kind of body part mixed in that did n't belong . but for a vegan , there are n't that many options . that 's no surpise for phoenix , but what options i do have are n't impressive . the fact that the portabella buger was not included on $ 5 burger night is discouraging . is that some kind of subtle hint that meatless crew are not welcome here ? i 'll come again , but i probably wo n't plan on eating unless it 's a side of fries . if you 've read any of my other reviews , you know that no matter what , i 'll always eat the fries .		3		0
we had a groupon for this place that we just could n't seem to get around to using . i suppose it was because the place was nearly an hour from our house . anyway , i really wanted to love it . but here 's what happened : things i loved : when we could n't get a reservation the last week of the groupon the owner offered to extend the date so we could use it ; they have a gorgeous patio - with live music ; service was very good ; portions were generous : amazing mashed potatoes and cornbread casserole . things i did n't : the prices - they are steep ; the complexity of the food . now this last requires elaboration . i was reminded of a tv show -lrb- this actually sounds harsher than it is -rrb- that gordon ramsey does . in one episode a very nice french restaurant was having trouble and he explained to them that their dishes were too complex and it hurt the flavor . he suggested they simplify , which i believe they did , and to good result . this was my experience . the dishes i loved were simple and absolutely delicious . but our entrees were not and they suffered for it . for example , my ribeye had cajun seasoning , then it had a roasted vegetable medly on top , then it had melted blue cheese over the seasoned meat and vegis . too many flavors . and not one wowed because they all got lost in each other . same with jim w 's chicken . it had panko breading and tomatillo cream sauce . but it also had goat cheese , crumbled bacon , pico de gallo and tortilla pieces . it sounds delicious but when i tried it the flavors were muddled and confused . i hate to say it , but i would have been happier elsewhere . i 'm going with 3.5 stars . i 'm going to keep an eye on their menu . maybe i 'll give them another try .		3		0
five guys opened on mill today in the old coffee plantation location . the place was bright , loud and busy . i was immediately impressed with how many people they had working ; i counted 14 just behind the counter . they had classic rock playing so loud you could barely hear them call out order numbers and the people behind the counter were yelling and laughing . it 's a pretty fun experience for lunch . i ordered the little bacon cheeseburger , cajun fries and regular drink . the burger was decent -lrb- not in and out quality , but pretty good -rrb- . i really liked that they let you load up on your choice of toppings -lrb- i got grilled onions , mushrooms , lettuce , tomato and pickles -rrb- they also had green peppers , jalapeno peppers , bbq and a1 sauce . i was a little disappointed with the price as $ 10.24 seemed a bit high . they did n't have shakes which was a major let down . all in all it was pretty good , but not much better than fat burger which is just down the block on mill . i 'll be interested to see how they far in the long run .		3		0
a man came over to my house last night with a bag of food . luckily , i knew he was coming . ok , it was a `` dinner and a movie '' date and he brought a huge bag from oregano 's . as i started to get out plates and silverware , he mentioned that paper plates , plastic utensils and napkins were in the bag . well , he sprung for dinner , i can clean a few plates , right ? huge portions ! he brought spaghetti with marinara . it was angel hair . i think there * could * have been more sauce . the lasagna was their `` italian flag '' lasagna and really good ! ooey-gooey with sausage and meatballs stuffed inside . the portion was enormous as well . we both had a hunk and i had another one today for lunch . both entrees had different kinds of garlic bread included in the container . the appetizer was something i 'd never had before : toasted ravioli . wtf ??? handmade ravioli , stuffed and fried with a side of marinara sauce to dip them in . there was definitely some kick to it , as they were stuffed with cheese and jalapenos . it was a very satisfying meal and i 'm giving it three stars . the portions were big , the prices were reasonable -lrb- looking at the website since he brought it to my place -rrb- and everything was full of flavor . this was no harley 's meal , but for something quick and italian , it was n't half bad ! of course , eating a meal on the couch with a cute guy will always be a plus !		3		0
this place is hit or miss for me . i 've been there several times and it depends on the server who will make it or break it for me . my other 3 visits were good but the last one was n't so good . the food is always pretty good . the last server i had served me flat diet coke or pepsi and when i complained about it he said `` yea we always get complaints about it '' . i finished my meal and about 15 minutes later he came in with another diet soda from another station and asked me to try it . i did and it was good except for the fact that i was done with my meal and would 've enjoyed it better during . desert is always spot on !		3		0
working evenings at central and mcdowell with no designated lunch break , our food choices are blue fin -lrb- if we get there before 6:30 -rrb- . cvs if we get there before 8 , or having my mother 's , siu wok or pizza delivered . no wonder i usually bring my own food from home ! i 've ordered or tasted most everything on the menu -lrb- thanks , sharing co-workers ! -rrb- - and it 's all incredibly decent . i ca n't say i 've tried anything terrible - but it 's very middle of the road , perfectly ok food . a couple mentions for the plus side - the advertised big slice of pie is huge - a quarter of a pie , actually ! i do n't do dairy , but have heard great reviews of the chocolate cream pie . -lrb- i was told the banana creme was pretty much lacking banana flavor - but the creme was homemade and amazing , so still worth it . -rrb- the other big plus - i ordered a blt which came with obscene amounts of bacon . i was expecting about half the bacon that ended up being there . that alone is worth a star ! on the minus side - bread choices are white and weat hamburger buns and white sub rolls . i wanted my blt on sourdough . had to settle for a white bun . not ideal , but not a deal breaker if you know about it going in . a couple weeks ago , i ordered the peach pie , available seasonally . they did not have any . hello ? mid to late may in phoenix ? it is primo peach season if you 're looking for the freshest you can get . which is really two minuses - the lack of pie i wanted and showing they do n't care about sourcing locally . i 'll continue patronizing my mother 's . like i wrote above - have n't gotten anything bad . but it will likely be for delivery when chinese and pizza just are n't calling to my tastebuds . i do n't see a reason i 'd go out of my way to dine in the restaurant - especially with so many great cenpho choices , i wo n't go out of my way for mediocrity .		3		0
went with friends to carly 's sunday evening , have to say i have walked by carly 's many of times during 1st fridays but have never stopped by , and seems like a nice lil local bar . nothing fancy , but not really a dive either . our server was nice and friendly . i ordered the anti-pasta plate because i wanted something to nosh on , it was alright , it did n't wow me thought . i also ordered the chocolate espresso martini and let me tell you , that was a great lil drink ! loved it ! my friend ordered the cuban sandwich and he enjoyed it . glad to have given carly 's a try !		3		0
il posto has some really good aspects and it has some so-so aspects . the outside patio area is completely awesome . it 's like you 're sitting in a little italian cafe , with one of the walls mocked up to look like the side of an old style european building . there are christmas lights strung about in different locations , a small bar area , a lil fountain and some other cool decorations . it 's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area , if only to have some drinks . the service was awesome . our waiter was totally cool , friendly and accommodating . the fresh baked bread and oil with cheese dipping sauce was fantastic . loved it . they had local beer -lrb- kiltlifter -rrb- on tap for only $ 3 a pint . awesome . the salads and pasta entrees were just ok , which is the reason behind my 3 star rating . i just was n't wowed by the main course . we 'll definitely be back to try them again though , perhaps to sample their highly rated pizzas . i predict a review sequel in my future .		3		0
i 'm really conflicted about this place . there are not too many taiwanese restaurants in the valley and i wish them success . i will probably go back . but our experience was mixed . we ordered quite a few different things to get a sampling and two dishes were outstanding -- the spicy won tons and spicy chicken and noodles : cold noodles with chicken , a few veggies and maybe a little peanut sauce mixed into the spice . carol 's seafood soup was unremarkable . the pork chop we ordered for my son was okay . our niece had one of the americanized entrees and it was -- well -- americanized . the service was decent , not as bad for us as some others here . i think i was overcharged though . my bill was $ 47 and i could only figure out $ 37 worth of food and taxes . i think an extra $ 10 was stuck onto the bill . i 'll assume it was an accident . i should have checked when i was still in the restaurant . mekong plaza is , overall , a great addition to the phoenix area . i 've loved the restaurants and the grocery is cool also . this is the only taiwanese place there so i hope they iron out the kinks and have a great run .		3		0
very swanky decor . lounge-y . lots of candles and dim lighting . hip looking waitstaff . terrible music . terrible . borderline happy-hardcore . like super upbeat generic dance music . vomit . it was bad enough to detract from the company i was with and the food . downtempo or jazz would have greatly improved the ambiance . speaking of food , i was very disappointed that they were out of sweet potato fries . the rosemary garlic fries i got to replace them sucked . tasted like regular ole fries dusted with garlic powder . i ordered the fez burger which was alright . the wild pear martini was alright . i 'm not usually a big hummus fan but i thought theirs was pretty tasty , especially the bread they served with it . yum ! i may be back some other time -lrb- we went during happy hour on sunday -rrb- to give it another shot since its in the neighborhood . half off bottles of wine on sundays will also be an incentive .		3		0
popped in here the other night on a whim . we were on our way to gammage , running late , but our hunger was a priority . we are n't the type of people to eat at jack in the box , chili 's or burger king , although that made for funny jokes on the way there . while i was driving , my dinner companion pulled out her iphone and found this little place , so we decided to give it a shot . it 's certainly not a fancy place . english is n't too common here . we both ordered different variations of the `` bun '' . apparently pronounced `` boon '' . essentially , this is pho without the broth . perfect for arizona weather . at least ... spring/summer weather . the meat was a tad overcooked , but overall tasty . my friend ordered a side of broth with hers . it was a bit greasy . my one criticism with my bun , was the egg roll . a spring roll would 've been a better choice , but that 's the health nut in me . overall , not a bad place . i 'd come back , but not sure if i 'd make a special trip through tempe .		3		0
in my quest to find bottled soda to filled the void left by the closing of pop the soda shoppe in scottsdale , i decided to check out a.j. 's . i 've always been impressed by their meat selection . you ca n't fault a place that sells crawfish , oysters , trout , and pretty much any other cut of meat you can think of . when i found the bottled sodas , i was in heaven . they have a chilled section with single bottles , and a shelf with packs . they do n't have a gigantic selection , but considering it 's not a soda shop , you ca n't fault them for just having one shelf devoted to bottled sodas . they had sonoran root beer , moxie , boylan 's creamy red birch , dublin dr. pepper , sioux city , oogave , thomas kemper , jones ... the list goes on . needless to say , i spent $ 30 there that day . this is no wegman 's by any means ... but i do n't think we can expect a wegman 's replacement short of an actual wegman 's opening in town .		4		1
last night i went to blue wasabi for the second time in the week . i am a new fan . we went at 4pm when happy hour started and boy did we have fun . we sat outside on the patio and my group of 4 only ordered ` happy hour ' items off both the food and martini menu , but we ordered alot . the martinis at blue wasabi are top notch , i ordered a lemon drop martini , the mowie wowie , and the `` milky way '' which tastes just like the candy bar and comes in a caramel dipped martini glass . yum ! the great thing about blue wasabi is they have more than just sushi on the menu , so if you 're not in the mood for seafood , there are other items to try . for instance my companions ordered the macadamia chicken strips which came with a sweet n sour sauce , and we ordered the ` fowl play '' which had grilled and chilled chicken and wrapped like sushi . both items were perfect to taste . we also ordered many seafood items such as the ` marilyn monroll ' one of our favorites and we love the presentation of it but our new favorite by far is the ` wango mango roll '' it tastes so different but is amazing ! you must try it . we are still trying to figure out if the blue wasabi is made blue with food coloring or if it is actually a different kind of wasabi . it tastes a lil lighter than the traditional green wasabi . our waiter chris is one of the best waiters in phoenix , he remembered us from last time and gave us top notch service , he is attentive without being intrusive . we were there for hours last night and some in our party got a lil tipsy off all the martini 's but we had a great time without breaking the bank cause we left right after happy hour ended . ; - -rrb-		4		1
friend and i were up early talking sunday morning and started talking about food , she said lets go out and i was like ok , lets do this ! did n't have a clue where i was headed just knew i was getting breakfast ! my friend woke up her hubby , they jumped into the car , picked me up and that 's when they told me that they read about brunchies on yelp and said let 's give it a try and glad we did !! we got their and it 's a cute little place , it looked crowded because there was a few people waiting , but we put our name on the waiting list and was seated within 6 mins afterwards . i guess we were seated in the patio area , by the huge fountain , it was nice , can look out the window on to downtown chandler . service was good , i did n't catch our waiters name but he was a young cute blond . pitcher of water & carafe of coffee was left on the table , how awesome was that ! on the table where tortilla chips and i was thinking man i dig me some chips and salsa but not really before my coffee , but i tried one of the chips and omg it was some sweetness !! tortilla chips covered in cinnamon and sugar , that 's what these where , so delish and an unexpected surprise , at this point i still have n't cracked the menu opened and was not really entire sure of what type of food this place was . i wound up ordering the westerner , eggs scrambled with green chili and ham with the season potatoes , the eggs were great ! the potatoes even though they were cooked , they were not quiet what i like , i think next time i will get hash browns and load them up with gravy !! the biscuit was huge , flaky , moist and delish ! i topped that bad boy with some honey and just let it melt in my mouth ! next time that baby is getting covered in gravy my friends ordered the southerner , and the mexican skillet chorizo , both dishes looked delish ! i also saw on yelp there is a espresso chocolate cake one can order ?!?! i am going to have to hunt that down ! i love me some cake ! so after i got home i checked out the place online and saw that it was owned by serranos , i think if i had known that before i went i would n't have gone . i have had 2 bad experiences at serranos so i probably would have let that tainted my trip , but it had n't and i plan on going back to brunchies soon !		4		1
not a country fan at all but my friend convinced me to go along because georgia chrome -lrb- a country cover band -rrb- plays songs on thursday night . arrived around 930 and i was glad there was n't a cover -lrb- at the time -rrb- . not sure if they charge a cover afterwards . area is very nice , very clean and tv screens everywhere . staff was very friendly and i was able to seat myself and 2 other friends comfortably . ordered the grilled cheese with fries as a side -lrb- you can substitute any side for the soup -rrb- . i was very impressed with the sandwich - it had 3 types of cheese combined with jam and it tasted awesome . fries were better than the standard bar food . i also tried my friend 's tomtato/pesto mozzarella sandwich - i recommend that as well . the band plays on top of the bar on a stage and they sound really good . did n't recognize any of their songs but they did play some cover some mainstream songs like `` do n't stop believin ' '' so i was able to sing along to that i guess . had a great time and i 'd definitely come back again .		4		1
first things first , yum ! some of the best tacos i have ever had . so much flavor i could n't believe it . we stopping in for dinner on a tuesday night , very slow , only two other table in the place at the time . no biggie , its a tiny place so it was n't too loud . did n't get much of a smile or greeting when we walked in , the `` waitress '' -lrb- whom we found out was `` just '' the bartender -rrb- spoke in mumbles and i did n't get that she was letting us pick our own table until she just started at us for a few seconds . anyway , we got a nice table and started to look over the drink menus , we were brought chips and salsa , excellent salsa by the way ! the bartender/waitress continued the evening with little to no personality , asked if i knew what i wanted to drink , i said i was n't ready and she just walked away , did n't even give my fiance a chance to order . my exact words were `` their food better be awesome to make up for this poor service . '' long story short , i hardly remember how wretched she was , the food was soooo good . starting with the salsa i was impressed , the guac was very good as well , very fresh . i ordered the braised short rib tacos and he got the carne asada tacos , both amazing ! so much flavor , just enough heat , and the rice and beans were good too , not an after thought like most mexican style restaurants can make them . very very impressed with the food . but the service was meh at best . this woman not only had no personality , she did n't seem to want to be there at all . i over heard her telling another table that she had n't even wanted to work there , at all , but her friend asked her for a favor so that is why she is there , and can tell us what she thinks is good but has no idea what is in anything . really ?!?! wow , can we say unprofessional ? she needs an attitude adjustment or to just get the hell out of there . but please do n't let that deter you , the food is great !!! the price is right -lrb- i think there is a groupon and a yelp deal still going on -rrb- . oh one side note ... the childlike handwritten notes in the front window ... tacky ! if you insist on having them there you should at least print them off the computer . but they are a little unnecessary anyway , we know we can only use one coupon per table .		4		1
`` it 's a toy store for grown-ups '' * eyebrows raise * `` no no no not like that ! '' when i was a kid i would get my allowance weekly and promptly get my mom to take me to the store to pick the new troll doll err ... i mean troll action figure i would buy with it . do n't look at me like that ! i mostly got the terminator and ninja turtle ones . . sigh ... oh but i digress . red hot robot is full of . . well red hot robots . vinyl ; it 's not just for records anymore . the hippest little world of geeky toys ... or is it geeky world of hip toys ? either way this place will have your inner child poking it 's head out of your belly button and your cube mate rage with jealousy that you have the cooledt desk toys in all the land ... yup my vinyl bunny-robot-skull mask will totally kick your star wars action figures plastic asses back to tatooine you mama 's basement living , wookie sucking douche . ahem ... but i digress again . get back that excitement of buying a new toy with your allowance and be the joneses of the cubicle farm .		4		1
this is probably the second time i 've been to this place . i came here with all my co - workers for a team lunch . we had a big group of 12 people . so we had a reservation and we were sitting outside . it was really nice especially with about 6 ceiling fans going which was great . the inside was decorated very hip . i would say the inside was medium size with lots of tables and they were so busy at lunch . very noisy with a lot of happy people enjoying their lunch . i had the philly chicken pita . it had grilled chicken with grilled peppers and onions over melted cheese . it was alright . not great . the chicken had some taste but not a lot . it was a big pita and enough to fill you up but not stuff you . so i would say its a good size . you can also get sides with it but i did n't . a lot of people i saw ordered their salads which were huge . it looked really good and i think next time i will try one of their salads . so the service was exceptional especially with such a large group and the place being very busy with a waiting line . we were greeted right away after we were seated and got our drink order in . drinks were at our table right away . they were always checking on our glasses and made sure our glasses were always filled . very impressive with such a busy place . the food took a little longer especially since we had a pretty big party but they brought out the food in a decent amount of time . overall , service was great and comfortable with okay food . i 'm thinking the food is okay because of what i ordered and will be smarter next time .		4		1
for some reason , drinking and loud music just seem to go together . you know what else goes with drinking and loud music ? young people . personally , i like young people . they just seem so much happier than old people . young people are fun too , as they 're often quick to experiment with alcoholic concoctions guaranteed to knock their dick in the dirt . -lrb- presuming of course there 's a dick involved -rrb- . this is why i go to sapporo . no , not to get my dick knocked in the dirt ... hell , i can do that at home . i go there because they have a discounted happy hour menu , costing about half of what others charge for this stuff , and , yes ... to watch young people get their dick knocked in the dirt . i wish i could offer some guidance as it relates to menu items but i ca n't . it seems that while the two or three take-charge type a 's in our party are dutifully filling out the order form , i 'm dutifully filling my gut with sake and beer . unfortunately , i do n't know what i just ate and for all i know , it could be filet of sharpei . in short , if you 're young and like to party , and , have a dick sorely in need of getting knocked int he dirt , you might want to try this place . if you do n't have a dick , bring your boyfriend or husband . after a few sake bombers ... you 'll have a dick on your hands for sure .		4		1
my boyfriend and i went to district before a concert at the us airways center . perfect location for a downtown event , plus they will validate your valet parking . we went in time for their happy hour -lrb- which ends a 7pm -rrb- and sat at one of the bar tables . very cool ambiance . we had a great server who made helpful suggestions and guided us through the array of menu options . i tried their red wine sangria -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- - it was a beautiful magenta color and was one of the better sangrias i 'd had in a long time . i also had their pineapple lavender cocktail -lrb- not on happy hour - $ 10 -rrb- which is very tart and lemon-y . not for everyone , but i loved it ! they hand-make their drinks with fresh fruit -lrb- so they take a little while -rrb- and use fresh herbs grown on their rooftop garden . my boyfriend picked the food and we indulged ! all the appetizers were $ 4 -lrb- except for the nachos which were $ 5 -rrb- . the pretzel bite fondue included three pretzels definitely larger than a bite , maybe 3 or 4 bite-size . the cheese was warm and melty . good dish . we also had the macaroni & cheese w / schreiner 's beer hots . i think this one was our least favorite of all the dishes we ordered . not that it was bad , it just did n't stand out . a take on mac & cheese with cut up hotdog . the nachos were topped with all the good stuff you 'd expect to find on nachos : gooey cheese , pico de gallo , guac , sour cream , and steak . the chips were a little thicker , so they did n't break and get soggy . finally , we had the buffalo sloppy joe sliders . great flavor , would definitely get these again . i 'm not in downtown phoenix very often , but district will definitely be at the top of my list next time i attend an event in the area .		4		1
this place is my old stomping grounds when i went here for college . anyways , the place has n't changed since i was here in the 1980 's . i came here a few weeks ago for the lion king . i think it 's the second time i 've sat in the balcony . one thing to remember is that on the right side of the balcony are the even number seats and in the left are the odd number seats . very unusually . we got tickets in seat 1 and it was right in the middle . another reminder , one of the bad things about the balcony is that you can see really good but when someone leans forward then you ca n't see and have to keep on looking over the shoulders . if you do n't mind not getting a great view when people in front of you bend forward . otherwise , get the lower level seats . you can hear really good in the balcony too . so overall , this is a really good place to see anything from concerts , plays , etc. . enjoy and have fun .		4		1
just barely 4 stars and that 's because the food was very good . went here for the lunch buffet today with rand h , norm r and mike c . the buffet is small , but with lots of yummy stuff . i only wish i knew what most of it was because nothing was labeled . when we asked our waiter ? what kind of soup , he said he did n't speak english but would go to the back and find out ; it was lentil soup , and it was very good . there was hummus , baba ghannoush and a couple other unknown dips to eat with the delicious homemade pita bread . check out norm r 's photos of the puffy pita pockets - they tasted as good as they looked ! there were stuffed peppers , chicken on the bone and a couple platters of red sauce - one had beans and an unknown meat - another had squash ? with what seemed to be lamb meatballs . i just wish they had some sort of dessert other than the canned fruit cocktail and some sort of pudding ? that tasted good , but again , we had no idea what it was . baklava would have been the perfect ending to the meal . the service was almost non existent , the music was a little too loud for lunch even after rand asked them to turn it down a bit , and not only did we have to chase them down for our check , we actually paid standing at the waiter station . i did check out their regular menu and while everything looks good , it seems a little pricey . the lunch buffet was reasonably priced at $ 9.95 .		4		1
i agree with ben h . the jokes about starving ethiopians are not only old , they are ignorant and tired . that being said , i would also like to address the age old question : to lalibela or to blue nile ? well , i was a die-hard lalibela fan . it seems to me that those who eat meat prefer blue nile , while those who chomp veggies like lali-better . i have been both a meat-eater and a vegetarian at both places , and i have to say that based on the ethiopian cuisine , lalibela wins for me every time . the spicy chicken use to be my favorite ... well , you can read my lalibela review too . so what brought me back to blue nile ? chef ron . on sundays and mondays -lrb- from open at 11am until close at 10pm -rrb- , chef ron serves up the very best in raw cuisine ! that 's right , folks . chef ron is the resident expert in raw vegan cuisine and he shows off his talents at blue nile two days per week . before you think , `` why would i pay for a bunch of raw rabbit food ? '' , you should know that raw cuisine has depth , complex flavors , and usually requires a sophisticated palette . i like it anyway . after some raw dolmas -lrb- i was n't so big on the collard greens wrapping -rrb- , super yogi and i ordered the living lasagna while hubsky went for the onion bread sandwich . after the requisite `` my food is cold '' jokes , we dug in . it was tasty . the flavors of the zucchini flat noodles with the spinach and mushrooms -lrb- which i usually avoid -rrb- ... the tangy marinara ... and most of all the cashew ricotta ... ok , it would have been nice if it was a little warm , but it was delectable . hubsky 's sandwich was tasty , but the grain mustard was a little much for me . the sandwich was packed with tasty veggies and tons of flavor . i saved room for the cinnamon roll , which apparently is a staple while the rest of the menu changes based on local availabilities . it looks small , but it packs a punch . the thing with raw cuisine is that you ca n't have expectations . for instance , if you order a cinnamon bun and expect a warm doughy mess , you 'll be disappointed . this is indescribable . no , i tried . i ca n't make it sound anything close to what it is . just know , it is cinnamony and rolled up . some other sample menu items include mango chili , watermelon gazpacho , zucchini hummus , banana ice cream , and orange cream pie with dark chocolate crust . have i convinced you yet ? get off your butt and go !		4		1
a delightful cafe/lunch spot at the north end of scottsdale road . the menu is creative without leaving out good `` fundamental dishes . '' the staff is friendly and the patio is really nice when the weather is good . coming in , you 'll be served bottled water . i 'm not sure if there is an option , but i 'm not complaining . they leave the bottle for you and do the same thing for lemonade and tea . we usually start with the truffle fries that come with three dipping sauces . you get ketchup , flavored mayonnaise , and an aioli mix . these are great for sharing and you can choose the size . things i 've ordered at lunch time : salmon blt - this is by far my favorite item . the fish is tender , but not too much to fall all over the place . you get an adequate amount of bacon , all smothered in a delicious sauce that drips into your chips or mixed greens . so good . compressed muffulleta - i tried this because the name is so funny . i was n't a big fan . it 's got the makings of loaded italian sandwich with some nice toppings . however , it goes very heavy on an olive spread that overpowers the meats . i may try asking for it without . it is very filling despite how it looks . chicken sandwich - i really liked this ! chopped up pieces of chicken held together with cheese , cooked onions and herbs on a fluffy bun . it has a great flavor and just a solid sandwich . roast beef - lots of roast beef piled high with horseradish . this one is for the meat eater in the group !		4		1
having lived in az for almost 2 years now , i finally made it over here to visit the zoo . i have been to others , including many visits to the wonderful one los angeles , so that is my background for the review . i think phoenix zoo here is more fun than the one in san diego , & holds its own well against the one in l.a. . one thing i did miss here on this hot day today was that over there i can have a nice big cup of beer or two along with my zoo visit , & i did n't see that here , but with that said , it 's a really fun place , & there 's a lot to see as long as you make notes on the map they give you . you need to keep track of what you 've seen & what you have n't , because the paths here zig zag & cross each other all over the place ! i especially liked the lush landscaping here , but i do have one complaint about the phoenix zoo ... the sky high pricing ! here 's a comparison with l.a. : general admission $ 18 -lrb- l.a. $ 14 -rrb- tram ride $ 6 -lrb- l.a. free -rrb- senior admission $ 18 -lrb- l.a. $ 11 -rrb- suppose your parents , age 62 , want to come to the zoo & ride the tram . it will cost them $ 48 , whereas in l.a. it would cost them $ 22 ! that 's more than twice as much , & the animals over there eat just as much as the ones here do ! minus one star for an otherwise great zoo here . : -- rrb - -rrb-		4		1
i never knew this place was here ! it definitely adds some class to the tempe cinema plaza . i met some friends here for a birthday celebration . inside , it looks very much like what you 'd expect a real italian restaurant to look like . we were in the bar area -lrb- enoteca -rrb- to the right . its very homey feeling . we sat at a nice long picnic style dark wood table . it was just right for the amount of people we had . our server was very , very nice and attentive . especially since we had people arriving at different times . they have an excellent wine selection . we all tried a different flatbread , which were a really good size for 1 , if youre really hungry , and perfect for sharing . i had the pugliese and it was very , very good . i would absolutely recommend it and this place to others wanting a nice semi intimate setting for a happy hour or dinner . we left just as the accordion player started his rounds , not a fan . they also have plenty of kitschy souvenirs for purchase . check it out !		4		1
we have some friends who are long time az residents . when we told them we were going to go check out old town scottsdale , they kind of snickered . when i questioned why this choice of activity was so amusing , they revealed that ots is a bit of a tourist trap . they seem to have forgotten that i have lived an hour and a half from orlando most of my life ... i 'm immune to tourist trap purchase trance . what is tourist trap purchase trance you ask ? well , it 's when you go to a tourist trap and buy a bunch of useless stuff you do n't need . you get home with all your bags of new toys when you finally snap out of the trance and wonder ... what did i just do ? oh yeah , we 've all been there . i was confident i 'd be okay though . we arrived and ots reminded me of a modernized old west town ... with oodles of shops , some restaurants and a candy store . i got out of the car and the first thing i saw were the brochure booklets with maps , a directory and ... a dining guide . a sure sign of a tourist trap ... the ol' brochure booklet . i 'm on to your game old town scottsdale but i 'll play along . i took a brochure . we walked around peeking inside shops , browsing through a few , but never making eye contact for too long . oh no ... never make eye contact for too long or you 're sure to get pulled into a buying frenzy . we gave the typical , `` oh just looking '' response to the shop keeper hook question of , can i help you find anything ? we were doing great . then came the pipe ... i slipped up in a native american-y store . i saw this really cool looking pipe . it was shaped like an ax . i held it and my hand started trembling . i had to have it . it had feathers on it . and it was shaped like an ax . it was so cool . so i bought a pipe ... shaped like an ax ... with feathers on it . i mean , c'mon , how many times in your life will you say that ? i do n't even smoke . my verdict is that old town scottsdale is pretty sweet . although it 's totally a tourist trap , it 's also entertaining and a nice place to come walk around . i did n't try any of the restaurants on this trip but look forward to coming back . next time with a little more will power .		4		1
yay for small theaters !!!! seriously . all you people that love those huge grandiose things need to experience the intimacy and power that comes with a small theater , and a nice one on top of that . the herberger is in a great location and is a great venue to see a show . the staff is always really friendly and the space is always clean . it has class without being too stale and old . like downtown hipster class . it 's nice . soothing . fun . good for all ages . the bar inside also has a window for the outside patio which is great for nice evenings and intermissions : -rrb- also , if you 're lucky you will see some musical troubadours outside as well . one awesome thing is that you can get parking validated for the arizona center for $ 3 . you park there , take your ticket , then go to the herberger box office and get a validation ticket . when you exit the arizona center , enter the ticket you got when you parked and then the validation one . so now you have no more excuses not to go -lrb- if the light rail did n't help already -rrb- . see you there !!		4		1
i decide to treat myself to dinner and i choose fleming 's as i had heard great things about this place . wow ! that is the best way to describe my experience here tonight . from the moment i walked in until the moment i left was great . nick , my server was fantastic and attentive without being overbearing . dillon , nick 's `` assistant '' was a sweetheart and the manager mark was awesome . i ordered the prime rib special they currently have going on and it came without salad , main course with a side as well as a dessert for $ 29.95 . i like the end piece of the prime rib as i like to have a little bit of a crust . it came out medium rare just like i like it and the crust on the end was perfect . the sauteed green beans were just a delicious and as well as the fleming 's salad . i could have had two of those as that salad really was that good . i only ate half of everything -lrb- sans the salad -rrb- as i wanted to save room for dessert . i was so excited to try the chocolate lava cake and i waited with anticipation to receive it as they are made to order and it takes 20 mins . sadly it was not all that great . it may have just been me but the chocolate was way to bitter for my taste . i have had quite a few different takes on the chocolate lava cake and regretfully this one was not a favorite . i did enjoy the vanilla ice cream that was topped with fresh pistachios though so all was not lost . nick , bless his heart was excited to ask me if it was a good as i remembered it and sadly i said no . he immediately offered to replace the dessert but i told him no as i really was full and i was very content with eating the ice cream . if people watching during the week is anything like it was last night , then i will definitely be back again to try their happy hour , which is nightly from 5-7 in the bar area . it will give me chance to try some of their delicious appetizers and drinks for $ 6 each and of course to people watch : -rrb- oh who am i kidding , i will be back regardless !		4		1
i decided to stop in to lisa g 's after dropping my brother off at the airport the other day . well , ` decided ' is maybe too strong a word . since it was rush hour , it was a choice between dinner near sky harbor or sitting in traffic for an hour . i fired up the yelp app on the iphone and realized lisa g 's was n't too far off . so off i went . upon arrival , i already knew i was going to like this place . the restaurant is in another one of those converted houses that are so prevalent around phoenix . the patio looks like a great area to sit and eat or grab a drink at . i actually almost considered it , then i remembered i was in phoenix and it was still over 100 degrees outside . however , as i walked in , i did look to the window and see the yelp reviewed signage up there . it made me smile . i was promptly greeted and decided to sit at the bar . a glass of some spectacular red zinfandel soon came to my hand and i decided to assault their menu . it 's not a big menu , but everything sounded good . on top of that , the smells wafting from the kitchen to the right of the bar did nothing to assist with my indecision . as usual , i asked the bartender and the server what they recommended . i was advised to try the spaghetti and meatballs , the house special . while i waited for my food , i continued to be chatted up by the bartender , the server -lrb- stacey -rrb- , and the host -lrb- jeff -rrb- . it all felt very comfortable and homey . the crew seemed very comfortable together and it just made the whole experience there that much more delightful . the food arrived steaming hot and smelling like pure meat and saucy happiness . the chef at lisa g 's had turned spaghetti and meatballs into a true dinner . the meatballs are apparently what the place is known for and rightfully so . they were amazing . when i finished basically licking the plate clean , i was almost tempted to get their `` bowl of balls '' because the meatballs were just that good . the sauce was excellent as well and , by comparison , the pasta itself was a letdown . i think it got a bit overcooked , but i 'm not gon na complain too stridently , as everything else was so good . i chatted with the staff for a while longer , learning about an upcoming wine tasting -lrb- 9-10-09 -rrb- and their pizza and psychic nights -lrb- wednesday nights -rrb- . i left happy with a wonderful meal and having met some good people . and there was no traffic on the way home .		4		1
in the past year or so i have become a bbq nut . i think it started when i finally went to henry 's high life back home in san jose . ever since then i 've been trying different bbq . in my search i came upon joe 's . my daughter and i went there one sunday evening around 5:30 pm and the place was hoppin ! there was a long line but it moved quickly . the smell of pecan wood filled the air and all around us families sat at tables devouring pulled pork , ribs , and brisket . it looked yummy . it 's a bit like a cafeteria in that you stand in line , get your tray , silverware and drink and then approach the food to tell the person behind the counter what you would like . i have a half rack of ribs with a baked potato the size of both my fists !!! it was huge but it was probably the best baked potato i have had in years . and the ribs were delicious . the sauce was sweet and gave a nice accent to the meat . the meat fell off the bone . my daughter had a pulled pork sandwich and i took a bite ... . it was yummy too . everything is fresh and tasty !! one of my favorite things about joe 's is their home made root beer . i do n't know of any other place that serves home made root beer . this was the bomb !!! i could have drank a gallon of it !! joe 's is the real deal . it 's a great family friendly place . the night i was there it was packed with families chowing down on some good bbq . and i got the feeling these were not first time visiters , it felt like everyone there was having a good time and getting a good meal . it felt like home .		4		1
what i like about f & e is the customer service . i ca n't get enough of going into a grocery store to do my shopping and everyone in the store offers to help or greets you . it is a refreshing change from the big box stores . i love buying 1 or 2 ready made meals a week . it is inevitable that i will need to use one that week . f & e 's ready-made meal selections are pretty extensive and are very yummy . i freeze them too , they keep just as well in the freezer for about a week . not sure if i 'm breaking any rules by doing that , but whoopie it works for me ! i love love love their greek yogurt . i 'm pretty sure that f & e yogurt is not healthy , ca n't be . nothing that tastes that darn good could be . it takes 45 + minutes to cook brown rice , the fresh and easy ready-made brown rice is fantastically delicious and takes 90 seconds to prepare . i shop around and i also find that prices in f & e are often cheaper than they are at the big box stores , especially fry 's . this store is always clean and is a great place to pick up your groceries .		4		1
we love surf & turf ! i mean who does n't enjoy an extremely well prepared filet mignon accompanied with a succulent lobster tail ? oh yeah ! so of course we had to go pay fleming 's a visit with some good friends . we go to fleming 's for their steak because they know how to prepare it better than most ! for starters we were treated to a warm , rosemary loaf of bread . the bread was already very good by itself , but the butters were even better . i do n't remember what each butter flavor was but i liked them both . i preferred the orange -lrb- sun dried tomato maybe ? -rrb- looking one . the white one had a bit of a feta cheese taste to it . we quickly polished off our whole loaf of bread . shortly after that , our soups and salads arrived , nothing special to write about here . next came our steak and lobster . the server waited while we cut into our steaks to make sure that it was cooked to the precise way we had requested . my lovely bride 's steak was so small it looked as though it was meant to be on a tasting spoon and not part of a surf & turf . the server apologized and was embarrassed he had not noticed it prior to bringing it to our table and quickly sent for another one . my steak was perfectly cooked , mid-rare but i could have used a bit more seasoning . the lobster tail was the highlight for my meal . the lobster came out served on top of its tail shell , but then it was removed by the waiter , -lrb- as if i could not handle it on my own : -- rrb - the lobster was not at all dry , which i worried about . it was moist , tender , and was pure lobster deliciousness ! as we dug into our steaks , we were given sides of asparagus and fleming 's potatoes . i found the asparagus to be seasoned and cooked very well but a bit overly oily . the fleming 's potatoes were like layers of lasagna , covered in a creamy sauce . i 've never been a big fan of any creamy potato dish , but this was exceptionally good . for the finale we had chocolate lava cake ~ a rich chocolate cake with a hot molten chocolate center , served with vanilla ice cream and sweet crisp wafers . the warm hot molten center with a scoop of the cool vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end this wonderful meal . fleming 's is a fantastic place to dine for a couple , family or with good friends . they are a chain , but they know how to cook steak very well and they are consistent . they have an exceptional wine list , which is what i recommend . their well drinks are a too pricey -lrb- vodka & water x 2 = $ 24 -rrb- so stick with wine .		4		1
post-annual-review day , i wanted to treat myself to a baller lunch , so stingray at the biltmore -lrb- bfp -rrb- came to mind ! and it was a superb first impression ! if you are not accustom to the map of bfp , its located walking distance from the epicenter of everything , but its worth the little cardio ! after stepping through some remodeling projects around bfp , i finally arrived to an artistic , grand entrance . and what i mean is you are fronted by a very tall , japanese inspired wooden door with modern trimming . so far so good ! = -rrb- i open up and was greeted immediately by the host and was offered to sit either at the swanky bar/lounge section or the contemporary , bamboo decor dining area . i chose bamboo for the lounge seating . after being seated , i noticed a nice feng shui touch they had was placing a bamboo plant centerpiece next to a little pouring jar of soy sauce and a warm cloth they brought out to cleanse your hands with ! what a great lunch so far and i have n't even talked about the food yet ! = -rrb- as always , beverage comes first and i decided on a cool refreshing mango ice tea ! c'est bon ! it had the right balance , not too much tea and not too much mango ! some places is really awful in trying to get the right balance ! so after spending a good 5 minutes and another 5 minutes and asking the waiter what is popular and not too filling , i opted for the yakinuku , which is thinly sliced , ny strip steak with sauteed veggies drizzled with seasoned soy sauce . i was content with my selection -- now the waiting . at this point i thought i gaze around and started to take mental notes on the high-end wall decorations and i mean high-end ! time elapsed and my food arrived . the presentation was just as good as everything else around me . this place was on a roll ! before i dipped my chopsticks in to my glorious protein dish , i had to take a quick snap for my facebook upload . and finally , i went in for the kill ! très délicieux ! it tasted great as much as it smelt great ! btw , it came with a side of white rice -lrb- not sure if brown is an option -- did n't ask -rrb- . i thought the meat was cooked to a tender perfection with the right amount of vegetables topped with very flavorful sauce . it filled me up just right . i typically do not order dessert , but because i actually had room to spare and this place was on roll like a hot craps game , i decided to order their green tea ice cream ! all i can is , perfect , as expected . i 've had this before at other places and its either just as good or a little better . what can i say ? stingray hit a home run for a great lunch escape from the office . i plan on doing it again !		4		1
we 've gone to mac now twice . first time for the alton brown show in october , and then just this past friday for the mythbusters tour . when we went to the ab show , j had originally purchased tickets up in the balcony . we quickly discovered that there was not enough leg room for him and the house manager moved us to an unsold section in the balcony . seriously awesome ! for the mythbusters tour , we purposefully purchased tickets in this typically unsold section , because the seats were just that awesome . we 'll make sure to buy those seats every time we see a show at mac . the parking situation is alright , i suppose . $ 5 to park in their lot . but , you get a slip for $ 5 off at participating business -lrb- i 'm guessing in the area -rrb- , so you kinda get your money back . . as long as you go to one of those businesses . i think next time i 'll try to score street parking like i did for the ab show -lrb- that was a sunday show , and y ' all now downtown mesa on sunday evenings -rrb- . it was drizzly out friday , so we wanted to park close . but apparently , at least according to the reviews , parking is sometimes free . it just depends on the act that night . given the choice to see a show at mac or dodge - i 'd pick mac any day .		4		1
the previous reviewers reviewed brunch and lunch - so i 'll review dinner ! cinco de mayo brings craziness to old town scottsdale and we popped in here to escape it . -lrb- i think i was lured by the classic rock they were pumping out of the speakers ... -rrb- as soon as we walked in the bartender greeted us and we were seated with menus . the decor and ambiance of the restaurant is great - beautiful glass and iron chandeliers and bright colors . they have an amazing tequila list - no cuervo here ! - which my husband appreciated very much . we had three tapas plates for dinner , which in some places would n't be enough to fill you up , but here it worked . all three were fantastic , especially the churassco . we also got the shrimp barbados and the double dip . the crab fondue with the double dip was delicious , especially when eaten with the cucumbers . the hummus as a little bit of a punch to it so be careful ! the prices were very reasonable for tapas and you ca n't beat $ 5 margaritas . i very much enjoyed carumba cafe and i definitely plan on returning . i think the next trip may be for brunch ...		4		1
it was a dreary cold and rainy day ... ok , well maybe not , this is arizona . i was absolutely starving at work and craving some good thai . i headed over to touch of thai because the reviews were fantastic . for an appetizer i tried the crispy noodle . i 've had it at other places and have liked it . you really can not mess it up and touch of thai did n't . do n't expect a lot of meat on it though but the one or two pieces of shrimp and port were very good . i love the crispy noodle because it 's sweet and reminds me of rice crispy treats . add a little soy sauce to it and you got yourself a sweet and salty treat ! i also ordered the red curry with chicken for my entree . it was very good and filling . i tried the medium heat and i 'm thankful i did n't go with hot because , ouch , it was hot enough at medium ! the chicken was great , was n't dry and there was plenty of it . the carrots , green beans and bamboo shoots were fresh and crispy instead of all mushy like i 've experienced at other places . very good . the waiter was great ! very friendly and attentive . was n't hard to be attentive since i was in the door right as they opened for the day and was his only customer ... bonus ! if you 're around this area and want some good curry , head on over to touch of thai , for sure .		4		1
what a great spot ! fez is the best place for friendly gatherings and good food ! i recently went there with 4 others for an early lunch . we arrived at 11:30 and had no trouble finding a table , but trust me , do n't try it around noon . the place is full of folks by then ! as always , i got the chicken wraps ... they are simply the best ! they include -lrb- along with lots of chicken , of course -rrb- dried pears , dates and cherries along with almonds and a pomegranate dressing . it is so delish and refreshing ! and , since this was a ` not doing anything but going back to the pool ' kinda day , i had a gspot : fresh grapefruit juice with grapefruit vodka and club soda over ice . yum . my friends had burgers ... and the biggest hit was the fez burger : with cinnamon pears , feta and crispy onions along with a molasses bbq sauce to die for . the biggest issue when this place is busy is the parking . the fedex store right next door has all of the best parking marked off for their customers . a couple times i have had to search for street parking . so go early -lrb- or late -rrb- to be sure !		4		1
i want more of casey moore 's , but the question is how much more ? my first experience with casey 's was a good one . keep in mind i went on a wednesday night , and it was mellow . i think this place could be rather obnoxious on a weekend , if it full of asu students . i was fortunate to be hanging with some grad students and couple post graduate people , all who were mature and chill . reading some of the negative reviews -lrb- and talking to friends -rrb- i get the impression a few meatheads , could really ruin this place for someone . the decor , location , and sprawling layout makes this place very different from most tempe bars . it 's hidden away on ash st. and besides being right next to train tracks , it 's very quiet . i like the fact it 's old , weathered and nostalgic . cms has a good variety of beer , and great prices -lrb- stella for $ 3.50 woohoo ! -rrb- i think like any place who you meet up with , will enhance your experience . i had a chance to talk to some fellow bostonians , as we chatted about boston culture . throwing lines out like `` get the pitccha it 's cheapa '' or `` i 'm foockin caaacked . '' my personal favorite topic of conversation , discussing the dreaded all white red sox hat turned backwards . anyone from boston knows not to mess with this guy . i suggest cms , for drinking and conversation , and now having been there on a weekend , it 's still pretty chill , at least after midnight , where we can let it all hang out .		4		1
i really enjoy all types of food ... this of course includes greek . it 's hard to find really good greek food with decent prices though ... that 's why i really like my big fat greek restaurant . they have a great menu with lots of choices , great portion sizes , and very decent prices as opposed to going to a fast-food feel greek restaurant for the same price . if you do n't get greek often or are taking someone out you should get the flaming saganaki . it 's greek cheese flamed with ouzo at your table and everyone gets to scream opa ! so much fun ! it comes with pita slices . yummy ... the flame will make you smell weird though ... fyi in case you 're planning on going out afterwards . i 'm picky about tzatziki sauce but i love the one from here . their greek fries are sooooo finger-licking good ... they should seriously be illegal . haha . yum ! fries covered in feta cheese , parmesan cheese , lemon dijon sauce , and oregano . i know , healthy and delicious . ; -- rrb - i love the gyro meat here too . i always used to get it . now that i do n't eat meat i get a vegetarian pita sandwich ... i change it up though because they have a lunch special menu with a huge selection of pitas . i always get the greek fries with it .		4		1
i have been wanting to try this place for a while now and my husband and i went here for a date night on friday . i like the look of the place . when we arrived there were a lot of people in the bar area , but not a lot of people at tables . the restaurant started to fill up quickly after we were seated and i was impressed that they had a lot of tables to accomodate big groups . it 's hard to find that in scottsdale sometimes . it looks like business is going well ! so , let 's start with a review of the drinks . 1 . health food 2/5 : it tasted like lemonade and was n't anything special - so for $ 12 i was disappointed . 2 . peter rabbit 4/5 : this drink was tasty and worth the money - i just widh the pickled carrot was bigger . 3 . honey badger 4/5 4 . old fashioned king james edition 4/5 : the husband let me have his luxardo cherry and it was yummy ! for food we started with 3 of the small plate options , then we shared and entree and side and splurged on dessert . they bring cheddar puffers to your table when you sit down and they are yummy ! 1 . egg and bacon pork belly 4/5 : this was good , very rich and the hollaindaise sauce was a bit sweet . it was an interesting take on eggs benedict . 2 . foie gras 3/5 : this small app was $ 19 and was an interesting presentation . i 'm used to foie being served with a cracker or bread option of some sort . this came with strawberries , peas , cheddar cheese and duck confit . it was kind of random , but it worked . i think incorporating a cracker/bread option would make this dish better . 3 . duck fat fries with tomato jam 3/5 : meh - they were good , but not as amazing as i thought they would be . 4 . diver scallops 4/5 : great presentation - corn and corned beef comprise the `` turf '' part of this dish . the scallops were large and cooked perfectly . 5 . fried brussels and walnuts 2/5 : they were kind of bitter . they stopped by to ask about them because another table had sent them back . i had wanted to do the same , but i always hate sending food back , so we just dropped it . something was off with the preparation . 5 . sundae 5/5 : the sundae had a banana bread base , caramel bacon popcorn , mascarpone ice cream and was divine ! i highly recommend it . they bring you a `` searsucker '' with your check - it was a cute play on the name of the restaurant . it has been ages since i have had a sucker , great idea !		4		1
i was nervous the first time we pulled up to fajitas , it looks like an old nj highway diner that someone converted into a mexican restaurant by adding a few decorative tiles and sombreros . it looks that way on the inside too but i had faith in the friends that brought me . fast forward six months and i 've been to fajitas quite a few times . i 'm addicted to their veggie fajitas ! i love the fact that they add zucchini , the veggies are always fresh and a firm with a smoky flavor and the tortillas are outstanding . as mentioned , the sides of sour cream , cheese , and pico are enormous . their queso is delicious and the chips and salsa are always great . i tried a cheese quesadilla there too , it was tasty but way too big for one person . service is always excellent and the food comes out at light speed which is awesome when you 're on your lunch hour . the lunch specials are cheap too . it 's a very casual spot where you 'll see everything from office workers grabbing a bite to regulars pounding mid day shots . i 'll get there for dinner eventually but for now , fajitas will remain a solid go to spot on my lunch rotation .		4		1
this review is mostly for terminal 4 . they have gone through a lot of changes here lately . almost all new restaurants in the terminal . a lot of really nice ones as well . i spent some time there today and without being rushed or having to be somewhere , i really looked around . i noticed that there is a plug in station on level 2 . something that has never been there before . this is the level that you check in , check your bags and get your tickets . also all new tv monitors have been installed . making it much easier to read the gates arriving and departing . i like it ! nice big letters . quite a few places to eat inside security and out . also security seems to be running nice and smooth . a few coffee shops as well that just seem to lull you over to sit down and have a drink and relax . i even checked out the brighton store whilst here . parking is still very expensive here . i do not know what can be done about that though . they do have a bus system that takes you off property to cheaper parking and it is covered . they do still free wi fi also nice .		4		1
happened upon this place last night for pre-thanksgiving drinking after finding 5th and wine having last call at 9pm . at first had trouble finding the place . luckily we just happened to park in front of the non-descript storefront and heard music playing from within . we read the sign which peaked our curiosity and went to the back entrance . the wooden door in the back simply has a sign that reads above it `` the truth is inside . '' it was a little intimidating because no one was around . no doorman or host . walked in , finding myself in a cavernous , spacious room with sofas and tables scattered about . we must have looked lost as we were greeted and seated almost immediately . the ambiance of the place immediately appealed to me as it reminded me of low key hole-in-the-wall lounges from my time in new york . no deuce-baggery or typical crowd from party-town scottsdale that you 'd normally see in the area . everyone seemed to be nestled in their own world with their friends , immersed in conversation or even just the moment . only a couple draw-backs i found with the place . the server that was taking our orders was fairly bad , with my party having to literally waive him down every time . also he seemed less knowledgeable about certain drinks than we did . other tables had noticed this as well , with patrons seeming mildly frustrated . after waiting 10 minutes for my old fashioned . i asked another server where my drink was she retorted `` i am sure your server will be with you shortly , '' and then walked away . i let it slide because they seemed under-staffed for the pre-thanksgiving crowd . the old fashioned itself was poorly made , watered down with too much club soda and an inordinate amount of fruit smashed at the bottom of my glass . i would recommend avoiding specialty cocktails , though i have not tried other drinks on their menu . i opted to try beer for the next round . the beer menu humored me a bit , as did the wine list . the owners seemed to really take the namesake kazimierz `` world '' wine bar to heart . the beer and wine list seemed to be a melange of randomly selected beers and wines from different countries , with no real particular direction or reason . that being said i did try a random beer and it was not half bad . what really rectified the experience for me was the music . the deejay last night was incredible , a mix of old jazz , funk and soul beats ; definitely played into my growing affinity to kazimierz . if not for him , i think the overall experience would have been less palatable and the poor service would not have been tolerable . definitely will be back a second time to see if kazimierz can rectify the hiccups of last night . honestly i fell in love with the place and think that i have found my new watering hole in scottsdale .		4		1
craving something sweet , but tired of the usual small ice cream shops ? then i would recommend the sugar bowl in down town scottsdale . step back in time into a pink ice cream parlor with a soda fountain and a huge menu full of ice cream treats . the sugar bowl offers pretty much anything that you can do with ice cream , including fantastic sparkling ice capades ! in case you are wondering what a sparkling ice capade is , it 's sherbert blended with sprite and the end result tastes like a push pop shake ! the sugar bowl is almost always full of people , usually a blend of tourists and locals , but i have never had to wait to long to get a table . also on the weekends they usually have a balloon artist walking around making whatever you please . i would recommend the balloon hats . so whether you are walking around the art galleries in old town scottsdale or hitting up the nightlife for a fun detour try the sugar bowl !		4		1
i love going to half moon ! first of all , it is in a great location that is close to my house . second , they have pretty good happy hour specials and they also usually have specials on food and drink when local sports teams are playing . they have a really big long island iced tea that is always $ 4 and that is really good too . one of my favorite reasons to go here though is that they have half price burgers all weekend . these burgers are fantastic ! they also have a lot of tv 's if you want to catch a game that is on . although i personally ca n't stand ufc , if you are a fan then you need to go to half moon . they do n't charge a cover to watch it like a lot of other bars do . and if you are a guy you may also like all of the pictures around the restaurant of girls with their butts hanging out . personally , not my thing but to each his own . last , if you have a sweet tooth like i do , then you have to try the cookie pie . make sure you order it 20 minutes before you want it -lrb- they warn you on the menu it takes a while -rrb- . it is yummy !		4		1
switch really impressed me the first time i went there for the yelp elite event . i decided to check it out on my own , and a friend and i came for happy hour one evening because she had a gift certificate here . we sat out on their patio , which is kind of odd , because it 's like half tables/half patio lounge-ish , and it 's located at the `` front '' -lrb- well technically the back -rrb- of the restaurant so everyone has to walk through said patio area -lrb- which is rather narrow -rrb- to get into the restaurant . so you really do n't have a cool view of anything from their patio , besides the people walking in . yawn . anyways , they have these daily , all day long , $ 1.99 drink and food specials . the waitress gave me a card listing them and what they are on certain days . i wo n't bore you with them all -lrb- call and ask -rrb- but on saturday night when we went it was $ 1.99 cosmos in 3 flavors and half off specialty drinks and drunk italian sodas because of the 4-6 :30 happy hour . what a steal !!!!! if you are looking for a place to drink and eat before you start out your crazy evening , switch definitely would be my recommendation . i got this mojito like drink that was huge and refreshingly delicious and only like $ 3 . and 2 cosmos for $ 4 . that 's 3 premium drinks for $ 7 folks . unbeatable . the food is amazing as well . there is something for everyone on their menu . i went for the mozzarella caprese , because i had tried a sample of it at the yelp event and dreamt about it nearly every night thereafter . it came with a cesar salad on the side , and i just want to say thank you switch for not feeding me fattening greasy fries and filling me up on the crisp , refreshing , deliciousness of a simple cesar salad . the sandwich ... mind blowing . even better than i remember it . seriously . the best . mozzarella and tomato sandwich . around . i do n't even want to try anything else on the menu ever , because i am so in love with this sandwich . i would have never thought a vegatarian option , let alone something that basic could leave my palette , my stomach , and my mind so completely satisfied . mozzarella caprese , will you marry me ? better yet , can i just rest my head in your delicate mozzarella , lettuce , and tomato bed ?		4		1
`` usted es el bocadillo ms hermoso ! . '' . . roughly translated . . you are the most beautiful sandwich ! while this place is in a transitional neighborhood do n't let the homeless fool you . . its really tasty ! the service is very friendly and it 's so cheap you can have a great taco lunch for under 5 bucks ! let 's get to the nitty gritty . . first torta i had from here the `` la presa '' could n't be finished . . not even by my portliness ! its 2 thick pieces of telera topped with ham , cheese , pork sirloin , breaded beef , sausage , chorizo and egg . this torta 's huge , seriously ! most come with potato chips though ask for the salad instead . its a serving of shredded lettuce , cabbage , sliced radishes , half a caramelized onion and a roasted jalapeo . imho , makes for a balance but really , you ca n't balance this out but the thought is there ! alambre de res burro , tacos and quesadillas have claimed major rock star status with me ! tender chopped beef , bell peppers , onions and melted cheese . . i think they use a little bacon fat too 'cause these bad boi 's are bursting with flavor ! ah , gawd ! the fresh juice they make here can also pass for a wonderful lunch substitute . i like the granola , strawberry and pineapple licuado ! a meal in itself ! they take your plastic card too ! just go for it !		4		1
my husband has been talking about this place since he saw the episode of man vs food that highlighted it . it did n't seem appealing to me , so i have been putting him off . next time dear . well , relationships are about compromise my friends , so eventually i had to give in and take the boy to los reyes . my expectations were not high . i mean , tortas are sandwiches right ? why get so excited . and so what if adam richman attempted to give himself a heart attach here , i 'm not big on the competetive eating circiut so a sandwich the size of my head is not my cup of tea . the store front is in a run down stip mall . it proudly dispalys a picture of mr.richman . it 's a little skeezy . i prepare myself for the worst . i have an issue with calling something with no tequila a margarita , or no rum a pina coloda . so , maybe call 'em smoothies . i am not impressed by the menu . my husband got the la reyna . now , a little background , one of our most explosive fights to date involved what he calls ` sandwich sience ' . i was packing his lunch , 'cause i 'm nice like that , and he instructed me that the way i make a turkey sandwich is completely wrong . he tried to school me in the ways of ` sandwich science ' i gave him the butter knife and told him to pack his own lunch . when my husband recieved his torta i swear to god a single tear fell down his cheek . the cooks at los reyes de la torta are certified sandwich scientists . the way they wrapped the chorizo in the egg was probably the most beautiful sight my husband had ever seen . his expression trumped the one he had on our wedding day as i walked down the aisle . his silence through out the entire meal , and the fact that i never got a bite , leads me to believe that the sandwhich was not only well constructed , but very tasty . i had the alambre de camaron . it was shredded shrimp , onions , cheese , jalepenos , rice , beans , and tortillas . and you know what ? i was totally wrong about this place . seriously . this was so good ! adam richman , you did me right . los reyes de la torta , thank you for a great meal !		4		1
i love the use of lemon zest to lighten up a pizza especially as the weather gets warmer . there was a light sprinkle of it on my clam pie even though it was not mentioned in the menu and it was also on the shrimp pie as well as the olive oil gelato in a candied version . the clam pie was a little disappointing - i was hoping for something like the ones i 've tasted in nyc . clams are such subtle things that more needs to be used and i would not mind paying a few more dollars for that . our disappointment was quickly redeemed by the wonderfully refreshing and balanced flavor of the shrimp pie . the combination of perfectly cooked crunchy shrimp , basil , chili flakes and lemon zest set off fireworks on every part of my palate . it 's something i would definitely go back for . the pizza crust has a great contrast of crunch as well as chewiness which reminds me of the crust at mozza in la but it does not have the complexity in flavor of chris bianco 's . bianco 's probably uses a starter dough that has developed that amazing flavor due to over a decade of use . that 's tough to beat . the olive oil gelato has a nice creaminess to it but tasted more like sweet cream base with a hint of lemon than olive oil . my only problem with it was my expectation to taste olive oil but now that i know it 's more about the texture , i think i like it more .		4		1
this place is pretty cool . it 's a real chill atmosphere and there are n't an overwhelming amount of people there -lrb- which i like ! -rrb- . i showed up to meet some friends on a friday night . the inside is great , there is a big horse , a small stage , and a bar maned by a fun staff . the decor is n't fancy , but it has character . a band was setting up getting ready to play . i would have loved to hear them , but my friends were outside so i headed there . outside there is a big patio . it was a little chilly , so there was a fire goin ' in the firepit . there was also a musician outside , so i was n't missing out on entertainment . she was playing calm , folk acoustic , making the mood of the night even better . the group of 7 that i was with were able to sit comfortably , there was plenty of room . we enjoyed good conversation over the music and were n't bothered by wanna-be types trying to be cool . all of the customers and staff there seemed very down to earth . great atmosphere , decent prices , and cool people .		4		1
it was sept 18 , 2012 ... oh you say whats that ? national cheeseburger day ! ive heard great things about wally 's and have been to its sister restaurant quite a few times grassroots -lrb- which is fantastic -rrb- and decided on such a momentous occasion why not give it a shot . first off the place is really cool , irish bar styled , really comfortable feel to the place . people here are very polite and friendly -lrb- staff and patrons -rrb- it really gives a cheers like vibe -lrb- the tv show not the shitty bar in glendale , oh you do n't know about that ? thank god -rrb- . i tried the wine burger which is slowly grilled with red wine sangria , topped with swiss and sauteed mushrooms annnnnnnnnnnnd its amazing . really flavorful and def worth eating bad for , it made my cheeseburger day easy . it came with mixed fries -lrb- sweet and reg potato -rrb- i do n't have fries much -lrb- cause they are so terrible for you , then again so is the cheeseburger but its a holiday so f it -rrb- but they were crispy and flavorful so also fantastic . the menu is full of lots of other tasty looking options i 'm looking forward to trying in particular the caramelized vidalia onion and guinness soup , i mean how great does that sound ?! oh you think that sounds gross ? go to hell , everyone else try this place : -rrb-		4		1
stingray has turned into my go-to spot for sushi in scottsdale . old town is sushi-row but stingray is trendy and equipped with a selection of tasty sushi , sweet cocktails and a fun atmosphere . located in the heart of old town , it 's a great spot to start the night off or visit for lunch if you 're in the area . my eyes are bigger than my appetite but the sushi is so good , i always seem to finish whatever we order . their cocktails are fresh and refreshing . they also have a great patio when the weather is nice enough to venture outside . sushi suggestions : dragon roll , caterpillar roll , spicy tuna roll , las vegas roll ... i know sushi is supposed to be healthy but apparently my taste buds do n't listen and i always order the fatty ones . appetizer alert : start the meal with the seaweed salad . it 's has just enough of a kick to it , but leaves you hungry for the main meal . happy hour : my favorite part about stingray is their top notch happy hour pricing . you can eat a roll that 's normally priced at $ 10 + for $ 4 . drinks are happily priced half off . ok , you sold me stingray .		4		1
the ol' d and d . a quiet and lovely sandwich shop/bar in an otherwise boring shopping ce of central phoenix . each time i come here after work it is slow and the service is excellent . the bar is usually staffed by older employees while the sandwich counter has younger but still very nice employees crafting tasty eats . the jalapeno havarti cheese is absolutely wonderful on a sonoran chicken salad sandwich . i believe the best reviews of this restaurant probably have taken full advantage of the customizable menu options . it does boost the price of the average sandwich up though . i almost always get pine nuts and pepperoncinis in addition to the standard options and the sandwich ends up being 9 dollars or so . a bit pricey but completely worth it . as mentioned in numerous other reviews there are multiple seating options . an outdoor patio , tables next to the wines and bar area , tables at the east end of the lower floor and upstairs which are accessed via staircase at the east side of the sandwich/grocery area . there is a great selection of deli meats and cheeses at the west end of the sandwich counter . a very respectable selection of tea , coffee and other local goods . including hot sauces , coffee cups and various small gifts . great place to hang out on a friday after work and listen to some live music while drinking a craft beer and enjoying their patio with a fire place . a note to those parking here . the spots for customers is between the office building and the parking structure just south of the building .		4		1
prm is the place for inexpensive fruits , a great-tasting torta -lrb- pollo deshuesado -rrb- , refried beans , and succulent barbacoa y carne pastor . grab a strawberries and cream cup by the juice stand . it 's a great way to end a very tasty and satiating meal . if atmosphere is n't important , save yourself mucho dinero by skipping tradiciones and eat at the food court . i tried to dine at the seafood counter twice , but both times the kitchen had just closed . to elaborate on the pollo deshuesado - i believe it 's chargrilled chunks of chicken -lrb- wonderfully marinated and perfectly caramelized -rrb- with slices of tomato and crispy lettuce on telera bread . ah , telera ! so , so good ! i do n't even recall any condiments added . just chicken , veggies , and the bread . why not rate prm five stars ? two reasons : bad guacamole - it tasted like water - so thinned-down , and yet at the same time had a congealed look about it . prm should be ashamed of itself for serving such a sub-par product ! oh , well . i should n't eat avocados anyway ... rice served has corn in it - it 's also served this way in the formal restaurant tradiciones . do n't get me wrong - i love corn , but my immune system does not . why not offer plain rice as an option ? rice and beans make a perfect protein combo why deny me of it ? at least i can always look forward to the tortas .		4		1
decided to try something new today so stopping into stax for some sunday lunch sliders . we were feeling a little adventurous so i ordered the antelope slider which had a raspberry jalapeno jam and the buffalo slider which is topped with muenster cheese , an onion ring and peach bbq sauce ; my friend also got the antelope slider and he got the wagyu which has bleu cheese , asparagus tips and spicy ketchup . we of course started out with the sweet potatoe fries which come with 5-6 different dipping sauces . my favorite slider was the antelope , the raspberry jam added a great flavor and the meat was n't as different tasting as i was expecting . the buffalo was good but the bbq sauce was a little overpowering and i did n't really taste the peach in it . the wagyu was good too but it 's really just like a regular slider since it 's still beef . the sweet potato fries were delicious as well . perfectly cooked and the dipping sauces were awesome . the waitress was really friendly and checking with us frequently to make sure we were doing okay and refilling water , definitely a plus in my book . i 'm going to try to make it back on a day when they 're serving kangaroo and/or ostrich , ca n't wait to see how those taste !		4		1
my husband and i came in early on a week day , after lunch not quite dinner . we were one of i think 3 table in the joint . fine by me , again , weird time of day , but i needed a drink . it was happy hour , sweet . drink wise their happy hour is ok , but when you look at their specialty cocktails you will have a hard time sticking to the happy hour menu . the shrinking violet was awesome ! pricey , but oh so yum . we split a couple of appetizers . we were not at all disappointed by any of them . i could have stuck a straw in the broth of the shrimp and smoked jalapeno rioja butter and just sucked it all up , really . that good . the hype on here about the market street short rib tacos , not a lie . so good . and finally the brown sugar jerk pork sliders . tasty . really really really tasty . with how much we enjoyed the starters i look forward to going back more the main event . oh , and the service was great too , very friendly .		4		1
oh how i loved visiting the duce yesterday . i really want this place to become something special in phoenix . what cool retro vibe we got going on here.areas for eating , music and shopping all have a hip vitage feel that makes you keep checking whether things are for purchase or design . soda fountain is as cute as can be . . ca n't wait for your farmers market and candy store to shape up in the fall . out in the dining area you have a casual long table area inside and a picnic table sensibility outside . the place makes you feel like you want to hang out with your friends all day and just chill . i had some tasty sliced potatoes that were half fries , half chip , yummy . this place screams potential . i am coming back very soon to try their dinners which look really great on the menu ... oh by the way they cook up a bunch of their food in a on site jet-stream trailer . nice touch . oh and by the way the girls bathroom was completely adorable ... i actually took pictures of it . it feels like a country powder room . i found it completely charming . rumor has it that they have a school bus to run people up to the stadiums for big events after eating . . great idea .		4		1
finally , i 've been able to see a game at municipal stadium . the last time i went to a game in 2006 , the game was rained out . there is n't a bad seat in the house . the stadium is a bit smaller than several other locations . i enjoyed watching the game from the seats towards the outfield . i enjoyed seeing the background of the papago rocks behind left field . a nice touch . one real nice thing about municipal is the parking . there is a large parking lot across the street . cost is $ 5 . i did have a tasty corn dog here . not overcooked and the hog dog inside was n't shriveled or overcooked . it was possibly the best corn dog i 've had in a long time . even better than the fair ! what brings down the rating is that the is zero lawn seats -lrb- my favorite place to watch a spring training game -rrb- , not much variety of food and the smoking . the smoking was a big issue . there were countless folks smoking as i was wandering around the stadium . i went to the restroom and there were people smoking between the stands and restroom/concessions . ugh i thought there was some ordinance that if you smoked , you had to go outside the stadium ? municipal is a fun and great place to watch a game , but falls short of some of the other stadiums in the area for me .		4		1
the vig uptown stands as an urbanesque chic castle at the northern borders of phoenix , az . . its upscale decor and sunroof area exudes a modern flow of hip vibes and good times . the courtyard with the cornhole arena is an excellent touch . and the food ... well the food was dec. . i had ordered the hangover helper , a monstrous plate atop of which sat a tower of chilaquile layered with pork , cheese , sour cream , and housemade salsa . then nested above this foundation were two over easy eggs . was i served a plate of food or a work of art ? and upon first bite , the flavors were very good . the textures were varied - starchy tortilla against gooey cheese and shredded pork . and the housemade salsa made everything taste incredibly fresh . but then halfway through the dish , i found the flavors began to lose their pop . the dish became heavily reliant on the salsa to sustain itself . it had very quickly begun overstaying its welcome ... the chefs here must learn that less is more . while great proportions is generally appreciated , sometimes it can very often do a dish more harm than good . pride is not the opposite of shame , it is the source . and the only true antidote to both is humility . i 'd definitely go back here but not for brunch . rumor has it that they have a mean set of burgers that i 'd love to sink my carnivorous teeth into ... to be continued ...		4		1
i went here for my birthday with my parents . enjoyed the atmosphere which is always important for me and the food was good but not amazing . i do n't mind it being real or authentic italian as long as the flavors and portions are good . i rarely get an appetizer but for my birthday decided why not . chose the bruschetta with crescenza cheese , prosciutto , truffle oil and asparagus . it was tasty but i guess i was expecting something similar to what one usually gets at postinos with several varieties . it was tasty but it they served only one large bruschetta to share . nothing wrong with that but just different than my expectations . i found my dish , the spinach tortelloni , a little on the small side portion wise but otherwise very tasty . i tasted my parents dish -lrb- my dad got the spicy shrimp pasta dish , a generous portion and what one should expect at $ 18 , mom ordered the burrata salad -lrb- which my dad had heard was also on the small side but with the added portion of salmon , a large piece -rrb- it was balanced out -lrb- however it was $ 20 for that , quite an expensive salad for what she received -rrb- . wine as good -lrb- i ordered a zinfandel -rrb- and the dessert i chose , nutella trifle was on the house and also very good . i 'd like to come again and see if there are any changes to the menu and/or quality of food but it 's reputation is definitely earned and i think it 's a great place to grab some drinks and maybe a bite if you 're trying to do happy hour .		4		1
so wifey and i decided to check this place out for our monthly date night . it 's a cool little spot around 12th st and oak , in the middle of a neighborhood . the decor is very modern , but warm and inviting . we opted to get an appetizer and a few of the small plates rather than the larger plates they had . they had a balanced but approachable wine list , i had an awesome tempranillo for under 10 bucks a glass ! we opted for the crispy shrimp and okra for the appetizer , which came with this spicy banana sauce and this cool yogurt sauce . i really really liked this dish , the okra was great and the shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked . not sure about the banana sauce , but overall a great dish . we then decided to get the stuffed dates with crispy schreiner 's chorizo and manchego . it came with dressed spinach , prob one of my fave dishes in phoenix right now ! we also ordered the macaroni and cheese and i forgot to mention the toasted bread and roasted garlic we ordered . the bread and garlic was just okay , nothing special . i , surprisingly , was not a fan of the mac and cheese either , it seemed very grainy -lrb- i know it was chock full of parmesan so that 's probably what it was , but it was just unappealing to me -rrb- . overall this place has potential . i 'll definitely go back , especially because we got out with 3 glasses of wine and 4 small dishes with tax and tip for under $ 70.00 !!		4		1
the airport is great . the airlines suck . but since this is a review for the airport itself , i 'll ignore how terrible , terrible the tenants are . the facility itself is nice . it 's small and made up of several buildings . it 's not particularly close to town , but it 's not that far away , and if you need to fly out of here , it 's not inconvenient , and traffic to and from is very light . there is a pretty good restaurant and bar on site with good grub and affordable prices , and there are the usual airport shops . the best part is the outdoor area -lrb- weird for an airport - i know -rrb- . there is a sort of courtyard between all the buildings , and considering the usual pleasantness of phoenix weather , it 's a nice relaxing place to sit while waiting for a flight . it beats sitting in a terminal ! oh , and they have free wi-fi , so you can stream movies to your computer or phone , which is especially nice since cellular service sucks out that far -lrb- at least on at & t -rrb- . because of the size , security is a breeze . on-site parking is very close . you could park , walk to the terminal , and get through security in 10 minutes -lrb- though you should always get to an airport early -rrb- . parking is cheap . not much more to say about that . oh , bonus tip ! if you go to school at asu or work at asu and have an asu parking permit , this airport is right next to the polytechnic campus . like right next to campus . most asu permits have reciprocal parking privileges at the polytechnic campus , so check to see if yours does . if you can park there -lrb- which almost anyone with an asu permit can -rrb- , you can park on campus and walk an extra five minutes . bam ! free parking ! yeah , the parking at the airport is only $ 8 a day , but if you 're gone for a week , save yourself $ 50 by walking five minutes .		4		1
had a fun time with 3 friends on friday night . hostess said wait was 50 min , but we were at our table in 15 . not bad . also i guess the bartender poured an extra glass of the nebiola so she gave it to me for free . delicious . i usually do n't like drinking red in the summer , but this was smooth and slightly jammy . good move on her part because my friends enjoyed the wine so much we all ordered glasses -lrb- $ 11 a glass -rrb- . there was live entertainment with a guitarist which perked up the whole restaurant even more . i did n't care so much for the bread they served . we started with appetizers : guacamole and queso fundido . both were excellent . the queso is a bit heavy and we only had a few bites each to make room for our entrees . the conchinita pibil was excellent -- tender slow-roasted pork with mash potatoes on the side . large enough portion that i brought the leftovers home and it fed me and the roomie the next evening . yl had the enchilades de hongos which she enjoyed . for dessert we shared the flan de mi mami . nice .		4		1
i have got to say i am oh so excited that el chorro is back ! el chorro was originally built in 1937 , it was used as an all girls school for the first four years , and then changed into the restaurant we all know and love today . however , recently el chorro has under gone a dramatic face lift . it is gorgeous ! from the fountain in the front walk , to the views of camelback and mummy mountain , to the soft candle light on the patio , to the fun bocce ball courts by the bar . the new owners have done a fabulous job of keeping the comfortable feel of the old el chorro -lrb- including keeping the old classroom bar -rrb- and at the same time making it their own . the official opening is n't until february 18th , but i was fortunate enough to make it in for their soft opening . as we all know soft openings are a bit bumpy , as they should be ; you got ta work out the kinks . whitney e. and i had dinner the other night and over all it was wonderful . the food tasted great and the view was amazing ! we sat inside by the window facing camelback mountain , i highly recommend this spot . we had more food than we could eat in two sittings . after the relish tray and sticky buns -lrb- long time ecl stapple , got to have 'em ! -rrb- we each started with an appetizer , i had the flash fried lobster and she had the crab cakes . both fantastic . the crab cakes are just that , cakes made of crab , not the cakes you sometimes get at other places that are full of all kinds of other stuff that you about miss the crab , but not in this case , they were perfect . the lobster was on par as well , served with a delicious ramoulade dipping sauce . then on to the soup or salads ... she had the caesar , which was good , but just a run of the mill caesar salad . i had the clam chowder , i was more than impressed , probably one of my favorite things to hit the table that night . the entree ... she had the fillet and i had the lamb ... both fantastic , but i think we both agreed the lamb was the way to go . it had the most amazing mint sauce crusted on the outside that made my mouth water from just smelling it sitting in front of me . i was n't thrilled with the veggies that came with it but the fingerling potatoes were great . chef kassels allows for any substitutions you would like , so next time i think i will go with the asparagus instead . on to dessert ... we shared the lemon tart , the perfect finish to the meal , not to sweet not to tart ... i recommend it ! there dinner menu over all is great , a little bit of everything ; roasted chicken , crispy duck , ny strip , wild mushroom ravioli , salmon , escolare , lamb , fillet , fried shrimp and so on . i have not yet been in for lunch but i was able to look at the menu and it looks just as appetizing , and thinking about the amazing view and bocce ball courts outside , i cant wait to come back and have the lunch . el chorro also has a great wine list , and very decently priced . i also love the signature cocktails that they offer , very refreshing , they will be great for the hot summer coming up . like i said , soft openings are a bit tough sometimes , there were a few service and timing issues that were bothersome , but i am confident they will be ready to wow everyone in no time . oh and ps : we were able to sneak around and check out the entire 11 acer property , that includes a banquette hall , perfect for weddings . if i was planing to get married anytime in the near to late future i would love to get married here . so beautiful , with both mummy and camelback mountains as your back drop . unbelievable !		4		1
i struggled a lot on whether to give this a 3 or a 4 . honestly , i 'm not happy with my decision and i 'm thinking it may deserve a 3 . this place is new to me , but i 'm no stranger to `` mongolian bbq '' as i 've been a long-time fan of yc 's . obviously i 'm going to compare the two . i liked that they had fresh meat , but it was a little fatty and since they use thicker chunks as opposed to shaved and frozen , it takes longer to cook your food . they seem to stack up orders on the hot disc . it definitely lacks the flair you get when eating at yc 's , but the novelty of that wears off after a few times anyway . plus , i know it 's wrong , but i prefer the frozen shaved meats to these chunks . it 's just different though - i would n't say frozen is better , just that i prefer it . i would even go so far as to say i preferred a lot of their fixin 's outside of the meat . they had a better selection of spicy powders and sauces than yc 's , and this place definitely caters to the spicy food lover more . they also had better vegetables . i should also mention they have a better selection of meats including two types of beef and even shrimp and scallops . even your choices of noodles and rice was more extensive . come to think of it , they really beat the shit out of yc 's hands down in the available food department . and taste ? well , it was delicious i must say . of course , i assembled the dish , so if it was n't any good i have to accept at least part of the blame if not all . if i had to compare , i 'd say yc 's is very reliable and good consistantly because i tend to always create roughly the same dish . gg 's i could see having a much broader range of flavors and experiences . the ambiance was okay for a strip-mall restaurant . it was kinda kitschy , but charming enough and fairly comfy . they had attention to detail . i think yc 's -lrb- depending on which one you go to -rrb- is a `` no frills '' sort of place compared to this . they were piping in some good contemporary alternative music as well ... for a minute , i thought someone had lifted my ipod . service was attentive , but odd since this is a `` get your own food '' kind of place ... they also have menus which is strange considering you basically put your own dish together and since the server explains the process again to you in detail . i felt a bit like a child being explained something so simple and obvious , but my girlfriend had a confused look on her face , so maybe it 's a good thing they do that . regulars probably just get escorted over to the line . i think my main gripe with it was the tiny bowl they gave me for the fixin 's ... but then again , you are n't putting noodles or rice in there like you do at yc 's - they add that as they cook it for you . so i suppose the portions are comparable . then there 's the price . a little high perhaps - maybe higher than yc 's -lrb- i know they used to be 5 bucks for a lunch bowl -rrb- . but you do get a lot for your money if you know how to pack the food in the bowl . so i guess i was right to give it a 4 instead of a 3 ... turns out i really liked it . i think this would be a real treat for someone who has n't had mongolian bbq before . i consider this to be a great alternative to yc 's ... impressive .		4		1
my kids just got back from a mission trip and wanted steak so we decided on the keg . been here a few time and a good choice again . i ordered the baby back ribs with garlic mash potatoes and grilled asparagus with red peppers . the ribs were tender and falling off the bone good . also enjoyed the garlic potatoes and vegetables . my wife had to mustard salmon . never had anything like this . very tasty salmon with a touch of a mustard taste . mustard was n't overpowering at all . very good . our kids had the steak and half lobster . they gobbled it up . so our dinner was very good . for desert we had passion brûlée . it was such a small little cup . come on . you can make it bigger . also had the billy minor ice cream cake . so good . the service was exceptional . they filled our water cups and continually asked about our meal . even the manager stopped by . very nice . overall , we had a very enjoyable meal .		4		1
i have a very entertaining experience at the sushi room that i will gladly tell while keeping names private -lrb- so as to not piss anyone off -rrb- . note that this is a whiiiiiileee back so i do n't know if their staff is still the same . phew so my date and i show up really late on a thursday night . the place is essentially empty except for a couple of people at the bar . we order a couple sake bombs , 2 rolls -lrb- spicy tuna and a salmon roll -rrb- and some korean-style ribs . the sushi was pretty tasty -lrb- very standard , nothing out of the world -rrb- but the ribs were pretty hard to eat with the chopsticks and had a bit of fat . still , it was decent appetizers and hh pricing at night , so we were pretty complaisant with our choices . they had a couple choices of sake which i appreciated , so we went with the drier -lrb- less sweet -rrb- option . with hh prices , it ended up being about $ 25 for the both of us . pretty darn good . halfway through our meal we notice that we are the only ones left there and that the staff is busting up the volume -lrb- 90 's rap -rrb- and dancing to it . do n't get me wrong , it was freaking hilarious . then , another staff member -lrb- not our actual server -rrb- invited my date and i next door to the living room , where she proceeded to tell us her life stories and flirt with all the owners . -lrb- sushi & living room are owned by the same group of people -rrb- . needless to say we had a great time , but it was all incredibly random . their staff was fun . they kept it moderately professional while we were eating and enjoying our alone time ... then let it all loose when their shift was over and we had paid our bill . lol . what can i say , i love the restaurant life .		4		1
i am so lucky to live in the upward projects group triangle -- with the addition of federal pizza -- my little part of the world has three great restaurants in walking distance -- federal pizza is my favorite because i do n't have to cross central and its the closest to my house . : -rrb- anyway -- on to the food we shared a salad and a pizza and both hit a perfect note -- salad had beets and pears in a great citrus vinaigrette -- just enough to clear the palate -- tonite we had a margherita pizza -- crust was perfectly done and held up under the flavorful juicy tomatoes -- my only suggestion is that i would appreciate if there were a couple of wines by the glass and a price point closer to 7 instead of 9 -- but other than that -- the restaurant itself is great looking as well , casual and modern . it was also nice to see lots of folks who seem to know each other -- certainly a great addition to our neighborhood .		4		1
it was a quick decision on wcg for our business lunch since it 's right across from the office , did n't really know what to expect , but the first experience was truly great ! there were 8 of us and of course i did not remember everyone 's dish , but definitely remembered a few of them . especially my ahi tuna salad , it was delicious !! the salad had a really nice presentation , a good amount of dressing , and the fish was just melted into my mouth ! the filet mignon cobb salad looked really good too , and apparently was very tasty after seeing the empty plate . another coworker had the center cut filet , and according to her , you can really taste the flavor of having it on a wood grill , she liked it a lot and definitely enjoyed the side of roasted mushrooms as well . we also shared a few desserts since the dessert section was on top of the first page of the menu . . it means something , right ? they were all good , but the one i was highly expected - the white chocolate bread pudding - was just a okay , i guess i was expecting more of a real pudding , but not soggy bread in a chocolate and caramel syrup ... if you 're a texture person , i 'll go for an alternative . .		4		1
09/29/13 i had to wait till restaurant week was over to visit and use my expiring local dines certificate here . -lrb- perhaps i 'll try cb on a future rw . -rrb- this restaurant has such a great atmosphere -- i would hate to see it close down ... i stopped by after work -lrb- around 815p -rrb- , and there were maybe only eight diners there , including me . : -lrb- i 'm sorry to say i forget the server 's name , but he was friendly and helpful - another plus . -lrb- i was fortunate to attend a gatsby-themed event here earlier in the year , and i was very impressed with the welcome and great treatment we were given here . the atmosphere was very fun , and the open sight lines -lrb- open kitchen , bar , wine closets , restroom areas , and design of the restaurant were perfect for the occasion ! -rrb- i 'd look for him when i visit again , but something tells me that everyone here know how to treat guests well . i really do hope to see a busier cb in the future ! enough about the atmosphere and service already and let 's get to the food ! i decided i 'd order the $ 13 purple potato pizza -lrb- mozz , gorgonzola , purple potato , leeks , bacon -rrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=q1vq6hi7g_wlhq5ghdk08g#q1vq6hi7g_wlhq5ghdk08g , $ 12 central burger -lrb- fried shoestring onions , gruyere , and frites -rrb- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=xb1125wtin3jpifzfbfnjg#xb1125wtin3jpifzfbfnjg , and $ 10 chocolate layer cake . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=ei3br0fwcayn1ybk3i1cfa#ei3br0fwcayn1ybk3i1cfa first , i must say that everything i tasted was , yes , amazing ! i believe that this was the second time i 've ever had potatoes on a pizza , and as was the case with my first experience , i find potatoes on a pizza to be quite a game-changer ! this pizza was gorgeous -- i loved the colorful impact that the purple potatoes gave to the pizza , and , even more importantly , the foodorgasms i 'd fall blissfully into with every violaceous bite ! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=e_dox2w9xrpbne6uf3m1ng#e_dox2w9xrpbne6uf3m1ng the gorgonzola and bacon pairing just pushed this pizza over-the-edge ... a definite must-try ! -lrb- this pizza also reheats very well . -rrb- the burger was also a terrific find -- the patty was cooked to a perfect medium -lrb- red center -rrb- and very juicy and so flavorful , the gruyere creamy and luscious . my only complaints were that the onion shoestrings were unnecessary , and the fries were presented in the style of frites , which means if you do n't forget to gently slide them out of the receptacle and onto some paper napkins , you 'll end up with a soggy mess in under two minutes . the challah bun was a great pairing , as well . all in all , two delectable meals . speaking of meals , the chocolate layer cake could be three meals by itself ! this six-layer cake was colossal and sat on top of what surprisingly looked and felt like the consistency of room-temperature evaporated milk , and tasted like it , too - a slight disappointment . a bigger drag was that it was served cold , and therefore not as flavorful as it could 've been . please do n't misunderstand - the few bites i had were appetizing , but not as palatable as the bites of leftovers i had in the days after . a big win was the dollop of creme fraiche on top , with garnishes of blueberries , sliced strawberries , and mint . i 'd order this again , to come out with the entrees -lrb- to allow to warm up to room temp -rrb- , and share with others . ca n't wait to go back for more scrumptious food , maybe some wine , good service , and to enjoy the inviting and beautiful atmosphere !		4		1
a whole bunch of years ago , a man brought me to pho bang on a ` friend date ' . it was my first experience with vietnamese food - and i was hooked ! on the food , not on him . countless visits to pho bang , and just as many to the newer , larger , cleaner incarnation - pho thanh ! while my standby has been an order of spring rolls , a bowl of pho and a cafe sua da -lrb- sweetened iced coffee -rrb- , i 've been all over the menu . the bun bowls , the specialty plates , all the appetizers , the banh mi -lrb- sandwiches -rrb- . and i have been happy every visit . i 've had men bring me here on first , or at least early dates - as a litmus test for their appreciation of ethnic dives . i 've met dear friends here for catch-up on life meals . i 've come many times with my former neighbor or my roommate -lrb- s -rrb- - because when the craving hits , it seems to hit everyone at once . when i start to feel a cold coming on , i think pho is a better medicine than chicken noodle soup ! i love this place !		4		1
one of the oldest spring training complexes in arizona is also one of the best . situated just outside of old town scottsdale , scottsdale stadium offers a great place to watch a game as well as a location that begs you to go out after it is over . getting to scottsdale stadium can be a bit of a pain . it is a few miles from the freeway and almost requires that you deal with scottsdale traffic . if you take earll to civic center and then merge on to drinkwater , you should be able to find either street parking or library parking for free . the dirt lots on the east side of the stadium should be avoided . also , the trolley goes by the stadium so you can park anywhere along the line and catch it . once you try to walk into scottsdale stadium , you will notice the food bank collection going on at each gate . this is not voluntary . you will be required to drop off everything eatable or drinkable -lrb- except closed water bottles -rrb- before you can enter . this , of course , should prepare you to empty your wallet once you are inside . the concrete concourse obstructs the field which is a big hindrance but the area down the foul lines and the entire outfield berm has a clear view from the concourse . that is where most of the good food is located anyways so you can stay out from behind the concrete monster . there are plenty of food vendors and usually a nice broad selection of beers & cocktails . seating in scottsdale is some of the best . the berm seating has a huge slope and features large shade trees . this makes for the best grass seating in the cactus league . the regular seats are a bit on the smaller side but almost all of them are close to the field and have good views . the practice field is beyond the right field wall . usually , this means the visiting team takes bp on the main field making this a great place for autographs . if you were to want a giant to autograph something , they all come down the first base line and most will stop and sign . do n't expect to have access to the practice field beyond standing behind a chain link fence . this stadium has hosted so many teams over the years , it is too bad the terrible giants play there now . ignoring that fact , scottsdale stadium is a great place to catch a game , especially if you are in the east valley .		4		1
as we all know , the food we eat is a great part of what make us healthy . true food kitchen 's scottsdale quarter provides a calming patio setting , the menu is derived from a food pyramid with chocolate at the top and is green certified . mature trees cast off fresh air and shade . the house is comfortable , busy and prides itself in preparing foods that can help people achieve and maintain optimum health . so , i asked for the steak tacos made with avocado , cotija cheese , tomatillo salsa , sour cream , and anasazi bean . 14 . these tacos were top top . i ordered a tasty glass of dark beer to accompany my excellent meal . when i was finished with my entree , i enjoyed an outstanding bowl of chocolate pudding with seasonal fruit . there was a sprig of spearmint placed in the center of the pudding that says it all . i 'm not quite convinced that the scottsdale quarter is all that but this restaurant implements subtle differences in their offerings we all need .		4		1
it was a 1st date , and he picked the place , told me we were headed out to get some sushi , and i was like yea ! love me some sushi ! we got to how do you roll , and i thought , wow what a cute name , but then stepped inside and saw it meant literality how do you roll , like what do you like for your rolls , now me being a new person of sushi only know how to order of the menu of rolls put together , so i felt dumb not knowing what to make , thanks hdyr haha , time for me to start learning so that when i come back the next time i will sound like a pro ! we ordered the philly roll , which was salmon , avocado & cream cheese , it was good and tasty i liked it ! also ordered the slamming salmon roll , had salmon , jalapenos , cream cheese , strawberries covered in sauce . now who would have thought salmon and strawberries & jalapenos would work , but omg they do ! this was a great roll ! and it started giving me ideas for other rolls ! it had heat & a sweet taste ; i think it was my fav roll ! last roll we ordered was the 3 alarm roll , it was spicy tuna , cucumber & avocado and topped with sauces , this one also packed some heat , but i was blown away with the slamming salmon roll , i think it stole the show ! so now i will do some sushi making homework before i venture back , but i will be headed back for sure !		4		1
yay ! i 'm a fan is right ! any place that serves a mimosa that big is doing things right in my book . i met my bestie there for brunch this past sunday , it 's a bit of a drive from my place but i have been wanting to check them out for some time now so i made the trek . worth it it was ! the valet is a bit busy but its complimentary so oh well . those boys hustled as fast as they could . the place smelled amazing , at one point i smelled waffles , then cookies , then bbq , i was starving ! i found my way through the restaurant to the back patio where she had already posted up at the bar . great little patio ! a couple tvs so you can catch the score of a game that might be on , at the moment they had bowling on , weird but ok , good thing we did n't care about what was on tv . the patio is super dog friend , which we love , both being dog owners . puppies and cutie pies all over ! they have this awesome brunch deal where you get your food and choice of beer or giant mimosa for $ 10 , yes please ! she got the flatbread and i got the pork thing , both yummy ! it was probably the best weather out i have seen in a long time so we had a very nice time . a must try in my book ! i am thinking about bringing the fiance here , maybe ride our bikes down the canal , which runs right along the back patio .		4		1
go for the happy hour , enjoy the drink specials -lrb- $ 5 martinis among others . yay ! -rrb- and order the big ass burger , but before you do remember these points : it 's open seating during happy hour -lrb- which runs 4-7 -rrb- . there were people sitting and standing around showing various states of impatience when we arrived . we walked around through the bar and front patio -lrb- the only areas open for happy hour -rrb- searching for an open table . finally , a very nice manager caught up with me and offered a booth in the dining area with the caveat that we 'd need to finish up or move to the bar by about 6:45 , before a dinner reservation came in . we jumped at the offer , likely pissing off some others who had been waiting as well , and probably longer . no complaints in the way it was handled , but be aware that it 's popular happy hour with open seating and when you arrive for a table you are basically on your own . second , it 's an older crowd . they look more like scottsdale golf course residents than workers from the surrounding buildings . no problem there , either . just a reminder that the line between `` happy hour '' and `` early bird special '' continues to fade . third , it was busy so service was a bit slow , though not unpleasant at all . i guess the message for y ' all : this place gets busy during happy hour . : - -rrb-		4		1
i should explain i do n't like sushi . i have tried to like sushi . i dated a guy many years ago who was really into sushi and he would take me to the best omaha has to offer and show me how to use the chopsticks and mix the wasabi , the whole 9 yards . i gave it the good ol' college try , and i just ca n't do it . my stomach rolls over after a couple of pieces . well , i think that , combined with the fact that when he purchased his new 7 series , i did n't writhe all over it like tawny kitaen , made me less appealing . such is life . now i 'm married to a man who does n't like sushi either . what was i saying ? oh yeah ! we had a great lunch at ra between movies . we each had the shrimp tempura bento box , which came with 4 shrimps , a spring roll , a potsticker , a salad , miso soup , and some fluffy white rice for $ 8.95 . everything was delicious . we also tried their seaweed salad which was nice and fresh . the service was great too . we had a few of their cocktails which if memory serves , were very tasty , but we got a little loaded and then went to see gravity in 3d , so my memory is a little hazy . it was one of those afternoons . i thought the lunch was definitely a great deal and would go back for that anytime .		4		1
my only dissappointment -lrb- actually there is one more and it has to do with cold balls ... proceed with caution -rrb- with the herberger was i thought it was called the hamburger theatre and was looking forward to a meaty snack . but alas . it is the herberger . not the himberger . or the itsmyberger . the herberger . rickie was an `` esteemed and prestigious '' judge at the miss black arizona pagaent . a pagaent , mind you , that lasted six hours . so i was a frequent customer at the bar . and the restroom . so i can attest to good bar service . one time as i grabbed a cookie from the bar , he politely told me they were $ 1.50 . oops . color me red . i had started out in the vip lounge where everything was complimentery . including the ice cold meatballs . but i digress . the restrooms . clean . really , really clean . the box office staff was friendly and helped find the right person who had my ticket . rickie had already been seated . you know , as the `` esteemed and prestigious judge '' . i was basically road kill at this point . finally got my balcony seat and had a great view of the pagaent and could see rickie writing and watch him texting me . now back to the vip lounge . no bar set up . which equals no adult beverages . kinda sucked . and the food was cold . i met the craziest pagaent moms . one lady , in fun , even told me to `` talk to the hand '' . i kid you not . oh . parking you ask ? across the street . i think we spent five bucks . i would most definitely return to the herberger . i will remember to bring my own cookies and to ask how long the show will be . the art scattered about was enjoyable and the theatre itself was quite beautiful . hopefully sometime soon the pet shop boys will perform here . that 's all i have ...		4		1
my boss is from indiana near the chicago side . he sometimes gets me to eat hot dogs when we go out for lunch . he prefers ted 's but i 'd have to say this is my favorite place to sit down and devour a wiener . dave is a cool cat . he 's retired from the music industry , look for his gold record on the wall ! he has all kinds of funny signs up everywhere . there are 2 tvs which are always tuned to sports channels , but not being a sports fan the appeal is lost on me . they do always have some decent 70s rock and pop going which usually puts me in a good mood for dog consumption . there are 2 kinds of dogs : boston dogs and chili dogs . boston dogs come dressed in mustard , onions and sweet relish . chili dogs come with onions , mustard and chili . ketchup is available over by the drinks . do yourself a favor and save it for the fries . i 've never seen it happen there , but i can just imagine someone putting ketchup all over their hot dog in this joint and instantly bursting into flames . oh well , that 's what they get for not being a true believer . the dogs themselves are custom made back east according to dave 's secret recipe . i do n't give a shit what 's in them , they 're delicious . the fries are decent , but nothing to write home about . everything else on the menu is n't worth mentioning . it 's not that it sucks , it 's that the hot dogs are what makes this place . so do n't puss out . get a dog and enjoy it .		4		1
after doing a little shopping at the otfm on saturday , i headed over here to try it out based on the good reviews from yelp ! what a pleasant surprise ! i 'm not a huge pancake person , so i decided to try the greek egg scramble with egg whites and the bf had the yogurt with fruit , since he had already downed a gf cupcake and cookie from the gf bakery . the scramble was delicious , perfectly seasoned and i ate every last bite of it ! also , the wheat toast was fantastic !! i also had a chai tea which was different , but really good ! so many chai teas are overly seasoned with ginger and this one you could really taste the black tea ! the bf had a latte as well and he loved it !! the only thing that was n't awesome was the seating process . there was a definite awkward process of getting seated ... not really knowing do you seat yourself , do they seat you . a more defined seating process would make this a solid 4.5 stars !!!		4		1
i 've been to chelsea 's on three occasions now , with the most recent visit being the best to date . my first time was just to meet a friend for drinks . i recall having a ketel dirty martini on their non-smoking patio . yeah yeah , i like to smoke when i drink . so i was slightly annoyed at this fact but i understand it makes it more enjoyable for people eating dinner . second trip was for a saturday or sunday brunch , i do n't remember . just had to pull up their brunch menu to figure out what i ordered - the daybreaker egg white omelette . it was nothing special , just standard `` healthy food '' . i liked my cocktail -lrb- a glass of white sangria -rrb- more than i did my meal . this past week i had lunch with my boyfriend . he had the kale & quinoa salad and added rotisserie chicken -lrb- your choice of white or dark meat -rrb- for $ 4 . i had the short rib tacos which came with a smaller portion of the kale & quinoa salad , so i was able to enjoy both without having to steal his food . the tacos were amazing . the meat was tender and juicy and they came accompanied with delicious guacamole , pico de gallo and salsa . i shared two tacos with my man and still had enough food to fill me up . service has always been on point and i appreciate the complimentary valet . this place seems to always be busy though so be prepared to wait !		4		1
first time to z ` tejas . i 've heard a bit about it , and one of my co-workers also works here . i honestly thought it was like a fancy chipotle . really nice place , with valet -lrb- + -rrb- . we got in and were quickly seated . my friend had eaten there once before , so he took the lead . we got a corona -lrb- him -rrb- and a midori ` tini -lrb- me -rrb- to start . drinks are a little up there -lrb- my cocktail was $ 8 -rrb- but let 's say i was splurging . to start , we got the tejas trio -lrb- salsa , guac , and queso -rrb- , as well as these guacamole , shrimp , whatever . i 'm not a fan of shrimp or quac , but i gave it a try and i have to say it was a little tasty . the queso was also really good , the salsa and quac average . for our meals , he got the barbacoa , and i got the chicken enchiladas . my dish was really good , my only complaint is that there was hella black beans and a small amount of rice . i would have preferred it the other way , but everything on the plate was good . i would n't come here on a whim with some of my friends , but it 's a really nice special occasion place .		4		1
living just a half mile away for the past few years , i really had no excuse to avoiding mi patio for so long . i tend to stay away from any place that chips are considered a course in your meal and deep fried is a cooking method . while i still stick to this mothodology , its nice to break pace every few weeks to keep your sanity . i mean , you cant live on veggies for too long without getting a craving for something tasty , meaty , and full of carbs . mi patio was just the spot . we ordered a spinach and cheese chimi and a couple orders of their tacos ; chicken and beef . after filling up on chips and chowing down the great tasting tacos , we could n't even begin to eat the chimi . while my expectations for a next day chimichanga was n't so high up there , it was actually still good the next day . i imagine that it would have been all the better had i eaten it fresh from the kitchen . maybe next time ill go light on the chips . ive heard their $ 1.75 margaritas a decent ; however , i can not personally attest to this . at $ 1.75 it ca n't hurt to give it a try though . either way you slice it , mi patio is a solid choice for your mexican delights .		4		1
hubby and i needed a splurge night so we hit up christopher 's . the atmosphere is nice , upscale , with a few different seating areas . very professional service . we were impressed with all of that . we had 3 glasses of wine . still , they have a great -lrb- if somewhat snobbish -- really , what 's this nonsense about `` anything but chardonnay '' ?! -rrb- wine list.they tout a big pour , but it did n't look that generous to me . we started with the escargot en croute . you get 6 small snails under an incredibly buttery , flakey crust . i wished for more protein , but believe me , not a flake of crust was left on the serving dish . it was so yummy . i had the duck pizza . i thought the duck was a bit dry and there just was n't enough flavor on it . i also got the mac n cheese . it was also just ok . i did n't care for the weird strips of ham -- seemed like a clunky execution . both went home with us so hubby could finish the next day . hubby got a steak . it 's served a la carte , so his $ 38 got him steak . maybe 6 oz . in a drizzle of red wine sauce . with a bit of charred something dusted on the rim . while it was well prepared , he spent the meal digging large peppercorns out of it , so they would n't get stuck in his gums . the waiter recommended the gnocchi , and it was probably the best we 've ever had . silky smooth texture . it was incredible . i mostly ate that . get the gnocchi . we finished with the tower of mousse , which was good . all in , we spent $ 174 . while it was quite good , i think we wanted to be blown away for the price , since for us it was definitely a splurge . i 'm glad we went , but i would n't say it was a terrific value . however , given it 's location in the biltmore shopping area , maybe they do n't need to care about value .		4		1
one of the best bundt cakes or cake in general around . the cream cheese frosting really makes this cake . the cake is moist but the frosting just knocks it out of the park . i usually get the mini cake or if you can get the baby bundts which are bite sized and always a big hit at parties . they come in beautiful party box and could not be tastier expressions of your affection . always serve the cake room temperature but i do pick up a couple at a time and put them in the fridge or freeze them if they last that long . of course they are on the sweet side , it is cake after all , but worth every bite . they are a perfect treat to share with that special someone -lrb- you have to really really like them though to share these tasty guys -rrb- but when i do n't feel like baking i 'll make the drive to this friendly store and pick up as many as i can . the lemon poppy seed is beautifully balanced . red velvet is a crowd pleasure , but my favorite is the carrot cake . ribbons of cream cheese frosting gild the lily on a cake that it not too heavily spiced and not too healthy tasting . hungry just thinking about it ...		4		1
this review is only for their meeting rooms and banquet facilities . i 've been to over a dozen luncheons and galas held here . they recently opened a new ballroom area that 's really impressive . the space is large and has huge glass walls that separate the main ballroom from the pre-function space just outside . the walls open up the ballroom in a unique way ... instead of individual small doors , it creates a grand entry . this is important because when opened , it gives your event a `` grand entry '' feel to it ... i find that impressive . also , the new ballroom gives you the option to have a separate valet entrance just for your event . again , this can be very impressive and convenient for your guests . as a guest of a few events that utilized this feature , i thought it was awesome . the banquet staff here does a great job with their service of guests . the food is always excellent . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fairmont-scottsdale-princess-scottsdale?select=z7je_8qf3wif6ad18f9hbg#z7je_8qf3wif6ad18f9hbg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fairmont-scottsdale-princess-scottsdale?select=n7cfbwu6hyg6os-wyah1vw#n7cfbwu6hyg6os-wyah1vw overall , they know how to help you create and execute a solid event . return factor - 90 %		4		1
texaz is fun ! i grew up in texas and this is the real deal . the chicken fried steak is my fave . but , last night , mom and i hit texaz for dinner and decided to share the fried shrimp platter . each shrimp is as big as your head ! ok , maybe not , but they are a good size , about 3-4 inches . for $ 15 is was a deal . i added an extra salad for $ 2 . all dinners come with salad , choice of potatoes -lrb- fried or mashed -- the fried potatoes are chunks of potatoes , deep fried ; the mashed are still a bit chunky with white gravy -rrb- , and a roll and a biscuit . the salad is basic -- iceberg lettuce and tomatoes . ranch or olive vinaigrette for dressing . the olive is great ! shiner bock is the house beer for $ 3.25 a bottle , other domestics are $ 2.75 each and imports are $ 3.75 . our dinner , two salads , 2 coors lights and one jd on the rocks was $ 29 including the tip . yee haw ! y ' all come back now , y ' hear ?!		4		1
ok , i have to start out by pointing out that i love acacia cafe , but their sign/logo is written in papyrus ... papyrus , people . i wonder if one of my graphic artist friends would be willing to work something new up for them on trade . but i 'm not here to talk about the logo , i 'm here to talk about the food . i have lived right around the corner from acacia cafe for going on 2 years , and never went inside . what a mistake ! they have the most amazing freshly-baked multigrain bread i have had in phoenix . we must have gotten there at just the right time because the place was filled with the aroma of fresh bread . it was so good that all i said to the lady taking my order was : i want whatever comes with that bread . they hooked me up with a veggie scramble with a side of the toasted amazingness that is their bread . it was heaven this is exactly the kind of place i love to discover , tucked away next to a dry cleaner in a shopping center . amazing , fresh food .		4		1
dillon 's is a great place to go that is close to my house and has really good baby back ribs . the service here has always been good to us . we now know never to come there on a wednesday night ... we recently came to dinner on a wednesday night with our 3-yo son and they seated us in the `` bar '' area since the rest of the restaurant was completely empty . it was comedy night . lets just say we could n't eat our food fast enough before all 4 of the `` comedians '' spouted out just about every cuss word you could imagine on top of making disgusting sexual and racist jokes . the sad part is that the crowd also seemed a bit put off , as no one laughed . even the comedians said we were a tough crowd . if i had ear muffs , they would 've been around my sons ears . i 'm surprised that the server did n't seat us in the other room or at least warn us that the comedians used this kind of language . and it 's not the 1st time either since we told our friends about it and they said it was the same thing the week before when they were there . i ended up not even finishing my dinner and spent a lot of the time letting him play outside while my husband finished his dinner . aside from that bad experience , we just know not to come on that night anymore . other than that , their mac n ' cheese is really good , baby back ribs are good and their bbq beans are a hit .		4		1
delux , a trendy , happening burger joint in the biltmore area . why the hell is this metal head going there to eat ?? - great selection of beer on tap . the bar offerings are 3/4 's of the menu . they did a good job on creating signature drinks and breaking down the beer selection into styles , lagers , ambers , porters/stouts , etc. . to help the not so intelligent beer drinker figure out what looked delicious . - pop quiz : how does a restaurant get away selling a hamburger for $ 9.50 ? topless servers ? no . lottery ticket with every purchase ? no . it 's by hand crafting their burgers , with bits of blue cheese , serving them with rocket -lrb- arugula for the lame -rrb- and caramelized onions on a bakery roll . the burgers are cooked to the customers specifics , rare , med , rare , etc , which is a nice change of pace from the fast food joints . the roll does get a bit soggy , but that is just culinary chemistry . when proteins cook , they squeeze moisture out . once a burger goes straight from grill to bun and cut in half , the juices start flowing . they might want to revisit their burger display idea and either leave it whole or let it rest for a few minutes after grilling to let the juices redistribute . - also their sweet tater fries are delicious . i 'm sure they 're commercial made fries , but they are tasty . and served in a cute little mini-shopping cart -lrb- gag me now -rrb- all in all . want something to eat after 10pm ? go get a burger and beer and hangout on the patio .		4		1
as a vietnamese person myself , i 'm pretty sure i can recognize good pho . while i am well aware california is the best for pho , as a resident of arizona i think khai hoan is excellent . the pho broth is nice and light . also , the mi xao is done excellently . i always order the appetizer sampler with my brother -lrb- spring roll , egg rolls , crab puff , and fried shrimp -rrb- and the variety of flavors was superb ! the prices are relatively cheap too - which is a good thing as it 's a 10 minute walk from asu and accesible by the light rail . it 's a bit of a mixed opinion here , but my friends ordered chinese food at this vietnamese restaurant -lrb- -_- ; -rrb- and i got conflicting opinions . one guy said that his was awesome , while the other said some of his chicken was uncooked . however , i get fried rice from time to time , and that 's done perfectly . if this is your first time , i suggest starting with the pho tai -lrb- # 3 -rrb- . if you 're the culinary expert on pho and do n't like it , just shut up and eat . as of now it 's the best pho in arizona , and it 's a nice change of flavor for those who have n't eaten vietnamese in a while , or ever !		4		1
i love culinary dropout . as someone else mentioned ... you have to think of it more as a bar than a true sit down restaurant . it 's a pub , that has been `` fox-ified . '' i love coming here with friends just to drink and have some light food , before a night out . their cocktails are all really unique and really tasty . my two favorites are the bacon bloody mary and the sauerkraut . the bbm is self explanatory ... bacon infused vodka is used , and even served with a piece of bacon instead of the typical celery . i 'm not normally a huge bloody mary fan , but if i 'm here during the daytime i always order it . the sauerkraut martini is amazing ... gin , elderflower , orange marmalade , and dijon mustard . with the mustard in it , it is a very savory cocktail ... which i love . goes perfect with the soft pretzels & fondue , which is my favorite app to get . as far as entree 's , the short rib pasta is my favorite , simple and delicious . everything i 've tried here is really tasty ... but again , think of it as classy/modern/unique / upscale bar food , not gourmet restaurant food .		4		1
what a find ! i found this place thank to my trusty yelp app . i wanted some good , spicy mexican food and rosita 's place seemed to fit the bill . in all honesty i was planning to go to los dos molinos , but they are closed on sundays ... you park behind the restaurant and walk around the front , dodging a few cars along the way . walking in , i loved the atmosphere . it was bustling and full of life , but not overwhelmingly busy . we were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pond ... hmmm . the service was prompt , the chips and salsa came right out . the salsa ... oh the salsa , it is delish , full of flavor and lots of heat , but in a good way . i ordered the chicken enchilada plate one red and one green . my companion ordered the green chili tamale plate -lrb- out of this world good -rrb- . they arrived glowing hot ! the plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about 10 minutes , -lrb- which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer -rrb- . once the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing !!! the flavors were spot on , the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great . the refried beans here are like crack . i was so full but could not stop eating them . yum ! i 'm pretty sure i have found my go-to mexican spot in phoenix .		4		1
i liked this place way more than i thought i would . scottsdale is not really my scene , so i was surprised to find someplace that appealed to me in a myriad of ways . you walk through the giant wooden doors of an otherwise lackluster exterior and are immediately enveloped in the cave-like atmosphere - stone walls , dim lights , dark wood grains , couches - then the music begins and it injects the air with just the right touch of soul . there was a bizarre seating process i 'm still not sure i understand , but once i was ushered to the high-back armchair at the `` reserved ? '' table next to the band , i felt like i had somehow magically guessed the secret password to the speak-easy door . -lrb- yes ! -rrb- the waitress seemed confused and aloof . the wine flight i ordered - pinot noir allstars - failed to dazzle . wisps of cloud on an otherwise sunshiny day . we did not order food as we just came from a wonderful dinner - but i must admit i was intrigued as i watched the fondue & antipasto platter that was being enjoyed at the next table . will definitely try next time ! atmosphere - 10 . dennis rowland -lrb- music -rrb- - 10 . service - 7 maybe .		4		1
tried this place for the first time on a wed night . we had a large group so they reserved a few tables for us and extended their happy our until 8pm -lrb- ends at 6pm -rrb- . our group very much appreciated this generosity ! i had the mr. pineapple beer as it seemed the lightest beer on the menu ; they had i think 9 others on the happy hour menu . crisp and refreshing beer . my husband and i shared one of the wood fired pepperoni pizzas ; i think it was $ 12 . the serving size was great for us to share ... others might call this a super sized personal pizza . maybe about 14 '' . it was a good pizza ; sauce had a nice spice to it . ours was slightly over cooked but our friends margarita pizza looked perfect . that 's the risk with wood fired pizza 's . the wine selection was n't all that great and overpriced compared to what i 've paid at bars ... they really had restaurant prices on the wine -lrb- a $ 12 bottle at bevmo is $ 35 here -rrb- . a friend ordered a bottle of red wine and it was way too warm ... in az you really need to have all your wine in a cooler ; the room temperatures here are just too hot for wine serving . so i 'd pass on the wine here and stick with the beer - but hey , it 's a brewery so beer is really the way to go . interior is industrial looking , i liked it . they have a medium sized patio out front and a garage door at the entrance they can open to bring the spaces together . we had really good service too . we will def . be back to this place ... perhaps i 'll try a beer flight next time .		4		1
if you need to go out with a group and everyone is picky , grand lux is the type of place to go . much like cheesecake factory -lrb- same company and in fact they have a few cf desserts on their menu -rrb- , the place is pretty big and structured like a cf would be . the menu is large in options to choose from to appease really any taste . great/large salads , asian , american , seafood , etc. . you name it . i had the indochine chicken/shrimp -lrb- i like the bang bang c/s at cf too -rrb- and was not disappointed . portion was great -lrb- wife and i shared -rrb- and the food was tasty . we had beignets for dessert which were warm and delicious . great service , good menu options for groups . only complaint is that it felt a little pricey when we walked away with a shared dinner . i 'm not in scottsdale that much , but a great place to go with friends to just chat and enjoy some good food to please everyone .		4		1
uhm ... this is what asian stores smell like so docking points because your olfactory nerves ca n't handle what 's normal for most of the world is n't really fair imo . i actually thought lee lee was pretty clean - there are definitely worse around . privilege , checked . besides , you 're not going to find 75 % of what 's in this store at your neighborhood fry 's or safeway . anyways , mekong and lee lee go head to head for best asian market in phoenix metro . for some reason , the packaged meats here are much fresher than what 's in the service section . seafood options are pretty well-stocked . plenty of sauces and spices in the aisles . the herbs and vegetables are the winner for me . some of the options look way better than what i 'd find back home in ca , so that 's a plus . prices vary depending on what you get . the savvy market-shopper will keep mental tabs on where to buy which items for the best value .		4		1
my boyfriend and i found ourselves driving through the area this morning and looked up a breakfast spot on yelp . he said u.s. egg sounding promising so we headed there . based on what we read we made sure to get an order of the protein pancakes , along with a breakfast burrito and a customized skillet . the coffee was better than average , and i like how they leave a pitcher of water at the table for you to refill as needed . the pancakes are interesting to say the least . you feel like you 're eating something healthy and at the same time should n't be tasting that good but it is . then you get a bite of granola like there is oatmeal or something also in the mix , finally to top it off sweet blueberries inside . they give you syrup to pour on but we found that the pancakes were wonderful and did n't need to be drowned in liquid sugar , just a drizzle here and there worked best . as for the burrito and skillet , you can tell this place really uses fresh ingredients because the flavors are top notch . i ordered avocado on my skillet and instead of two or three skimpy slices there was a generous half , not to mention perfectly ripe . our waitress was attentive but not aggressive . ca n't wait to come back to try more items !		4		1
i 've been to la bocca a handful of times now , mostly because its one of the few `` nicer '' options on mill . because of that it is getting a 4th star but the food and drink only warrant 3 . lets just call la bocca what it is ... it 's a starter wine bar for college kids . the wine list is less than impressive and anyone that actually enjoys drinking wine would n't settle for a wine bar with a wine list that is dominated by wine from california . yes , names like `` little black dress '' are cute but this is n't a quality selection . but the kiddies have got to start somewhere when they are learning about wine and that is the purpose of la bocca . as far as the food goes ... well ... the mediterranean salad is good . get that . i ca n't say that i would suggest the bruschetta . the flavors are lacking in creativity and they are often poorly constructed . the pizza is ok , but like i said , stick to that salad . should you find yourself on mill you could do much , much worse . if you are looking for a wine bar in the vein of postino , cheuvront , or tapino , think again . you are on mill after all .		4		1
fresh , wholesome ingredients are the focus of true food kitchen . the atmosphere tied into the menu in a refreshing way , reflecting the deconstructed , pure menu offerings ... yet , the ambiance really speaks louder than the food itself . we warmed up with some hummus and pitas with a side of persian cucumbers . a little on the bland side , but the freshness factor compensated . after narrowing down the menu to a few choice items , our waitress gave us some direction . she had an extensive knowledge of the menu and the health benefits of nearly every ingredient . my top picks ? spaghetti squash casserole , natural steak tacos , turkey bolognese and the bison burger . we were hungry so the bison seemed like the best choice . i 'm not in-the-know about bison , but our waitress told us it is as lean as a white meat . pretty groovy -lrb- yes , i said groovy -rrb- , considering it tasted as sinful as the beef equivalent . the meat was juicy and cooked to near perfection -lrb- a tad bit well done ... -rrb- . it was accompanied by a kale salad and sweet potato hash . the salad had a unique herbaceous flavor -- definitely not what i was expecting . it was dressed perfectly with a lemon vinaigrette . i loved the crispy sweet potato hash . if you 're looking for huge portions , true food kitchen probably is n't the best place to go . high fructose corn syrup and refined sugar are no-no 's at true food kitchen ; i practically offended our server when asking for a side of barbeque sauce -lrb- they did run next door to zinburger to get a side for me , which i appreciated -rrb- . i 'll probably come back ; the non-alcoholic elixirs and some of the raw seafood specials looked tempting . not bad , not bad at all .		4		1
i 've been here a few times and always seem to have a good time . the beer is cold and they have drink specials all the time . their servers are friendly and hustle for you . the outdoor patio can be somewhat smokey so sit as far away from the patio if the smoke bothers you . there is a guy that sings and plays the guitar in the evening . there 's some floor to ceiling tv 's so you can see all the sporting events . i think their burgers are below meh , eventhough they are $ 5 on monday night . the flat bread for 1/2 price off on wednesday is a great deal . their chicken fingers are tasty as well . i have had their tortilla soup which was good but not great . my favorite dish so far is the fish & chips -lrb- fries -rrb- . this dish is $ 14 for dinner and $ 9 for lunch . the fish is fried in a batter and is delicious . this is their signature dish ; so you should definitely order the fish . since this is a seahawks bar , i guess they wo n't allow any bears fans in the pub this sunday . other than being seahawks fans , these guys are ok .		4		1
living near this place a long time ago and driving by i never stopped in . after seeing more than positive reviews on yelp here i decided to give it a try . here 's one thing that bothers me about non-chain places : train your staff to have a favorite ! whenever i go to a place i 've never been i always ask ` what do you recommend ? ' -- the default of ` everything is good ' is not an answer people !!! be confident in what your best dish is and i 'm ordering it unquestioned . there has to be something that defines your restaurant ... if there is n't , then you are just like a chain . given that -lrb- i did n't get a recommendation -rrb- , i went with my trusty judge of chorizo -lrb- burrito with egg and refried beans -rrb- . it was plenty portion and just came as the burrito . it was good . not great , but good . no free chips like others have said . this did n't really bother me as i 'm trying to eat better and knew i 'd be stuffing my face with a giant tortilla , pork fat and beans likely cooked in lard -lrb- which is a good thing , btw -rrb- . the salsa was ok . definitely could improve here in my opinon . i think el ricos in queen creek has better salsa . i am agreeing with others on the price . my * lunch * burrito was $ 8.99 . that 's steep for a lunch single item . compared to burrito shack at nearly half that -lrb- and bigger burrito -rrb- . i do n't think the taste -- which was good -- justified the cost . my guess is that overhead is high in the complex . i 'd love it if there prices were lower -- if even for lunch specials . place was clean , ample seating and staff was friendly . i will return and try other things -lrb- and bring friends -rrb- . they are also on twitter : http://twitter.com/lulustacoshop which scores an extra point in my book ... hopefully they will push out lunch discount deals via twitter and that will bring me back sooner . good mexican , wish the price was just a bit lower . honestly i was going to rate 3 stars just now but really wanted 3.5 . i 'm giving lulus the benefit here and going with 4 . the food is good , prices could be better , but overall a good mexican food experience and i will return ... hopefully with a discount i got via twitter -lrb- hint , hint -rrb- .		4		1
the new just enough menu is just enough but could even be a little smaller . in looking over the new lunch menu there was a variety of salad and sandwich choices . for a little extra one could add one of the soups including my favorite french onion . i narrowed it down to the chicken , fruit and baby greens salad with the choice of a muffin or the parmesan crusted chicken breast sandwich . i chose the salad with the obligatory carrot muffin and added the french onion soup . the soup was good and hot and not something i would ever fix at home . i have tried microwaving tj 's french onion but mimi 's tasted a lot better with the freshly melted cheese . i have never tried to make french onion soup nor have had the inclination to make soup since it appears to be a lot of work plus there would be a lot left over . the fresh salad with balsamic vinaigrette met my taste bud expectations but i had hoped the muffin would have been half the usual size . instead , the muffin ended up going home in a plastic box for later in the day while watching the summer olympics .		4		1
cute little place , stopped by for a late am bite -lrb- twss -rrb- , kind of reminded me of a mini-raven cafe in prescott . small and broken in feel to it . quaint . young kids working there , with black nail polish but they were nice . the barrista was ` happy ' too , he liked to dance to the music . did n't try the coffee drinks but the espresso shots looked competent . had the blt and a side salad . decent for sure . substituted the mayo for mustard as they had no alternate home made sauce -lrb- was thinking a tangy chipotle type condiment would have been better than mustard -rrb- , either way it good . on a crisp ciabatta roll . side salad nice . ice tea decent . they have a drive thru too . it was n't busy for a saturday around 1130 . i liked the feel of 32 shea , will be back when on that side of town to try some breakfast and a coffee drink . i wish i had a little place like this by my house , that 's all i 'm saying about that . recommended , wine and bar looked cool too . good vibe .		4		1
did someone say sushi ?! oh wait , that 's my daily craving ! it was new year day and guess what i wanted to have for dinner to ring in the mew year ? you guessed it , sushi ! originally , i was going to go to another sushi joint which i will not name here cause i do n't want to start a sushi rivalry but the other joint was closed on new year day . as it turns out , it was a blessing in disguise since squid ink is located right next to the ice skating rink so we were able to have dinner then walk right over to go skating - so convenient ! we had quite a feast . chicken teriyaki bowl for my son , chicken teriyaki noodle for his friend , edamame , shisito peppers , 3 california rolls , 1 spicy salmon roll , miso cod . oh , did you think the rolls were for me ? of course not ! my growing boy ate his chicken teriyaki bowl then proceeded to eat the california rolls and the spicy salmon roll . after some gentle reminders , i did get a few pieces from each of the different rolls . it 's a good thing when my son heartily eats -lrb- since for a young ` n , he has a pretty good palate -rrb- and we are fighting , hmm i mean sharing happily our sushi ! michele m. who also joined us for dinner ordered gyoza , fried tofu , california roll , fried shrimp tempura roll also enjoyed her selections . my fav out of them all was the miso cod . 4 thin slices , perfectly cooked so the cod was still tender and moist . hmmm , just thinking about it makes me what to have it again . service is amicable . staff friendly . glad to have come here - and will come again !		4		1
there 's plenty of potential here , and the $ 2 mimosas on the weekends are pretty awesome . but we waited around 45 minutes for our food . my dish arrived tepid . the hangover hash was disappointing , but my wife 's island eggs benedict was terrific , with rich and smoky ham . i eat a lot of ham , and hula 's ham made me take a step back . maybe the late service should be chalked up to a rush or an anomaly , but our server did n't seem particularly aware of how long it was taking , and also did n't seem interested in checking in on us . addendum : hula 's owner reached out to apologize for our lack of service that day , assuring me they were still working out a few logistical issues . having worked in the restaurant industry , i 'm aware how those things often spiral out of control of the staff . i 've waited far longer at places , and part of this review stemmed from the fact our 16 month old daughter was with us , tired and cranky . the truth is , we loved the ambiance and prices . if the food had come quicker , we would 've been pleased with the service -lrb- we could 've had more check-ins , however -rrb- . i should 've emphasized the potential ... when the logistics are ironed out , this will be one of the best brunches in phoenix . as-is , it 's really good . -lrb- if you do n't have a toddler who has n't napped , that is . -rrb-		4		1
i have had the pleasure of hitting up the main ingredient for both food and drinks and have been impressed each time . now that summer has evaporated , the true potential of their patio has begun to emerge . their location on 7th street is not dazzling , but the place is tucked back enough from the street to allow the old-school hip hop music , low hanging light-studded trees , and candle-lit tables to work their magic . there is also a bench with a large barrel for a table that my friend noticed only at the end of our meal that if available , must be snagged for use . the inside of tmi might even have better atmosphere which feels warm and luscious with the lights dimmed and candles everywhere . their beer selection is extensive and they carry one of my favorite brews -lrb- agave wheat -rrb- . the food menu is short , but everything is generally tasty , specifically the mac and cheese with the green chiles . i 'd knock the menu only for its spareness . i 'd like to see a few more interesting additions to their food selection , but there really is no place i would rather go to on a random night of the week at 9pm for a drink .		4		1
in the land overloaded with restaurants , sometimes it takes some time to finally make it to one that 's been right under your noise the whole time . for me , this is j alexanders . i probably visit the borgata area several times a week ; whether it 's to grocery shop , get a manicure or have a meal . yet , i never made it to j alexanders . i always wanted to try it out , just never got the chance -- until tonight that is . it 's the midst of spring training season which means every restaurant , including the less than par ones , are packed to the brim with an hour wait . luckily for us , tonight we got there just before the tourist crowd and got seated right away in a prime table on the patio . upon first glance at the menu , i saw that it stocked full of cuisine options -- everything from steak to sandwiches to plenty of seafood choices . we started with the spanish spinach dip and some local brew from four peaks . for my entree , i decided to go with the chicken sandwich and couscous on the side . the chicken sandwich tasted exactly like the biltmore chicken sandwich from houston 's . that 's not necessarily a bad thing since i like the sandwich , but it was interesting to taste such a strong resemblance . the couscous was really delicious and they did an excellent job of blending the spices and dressing up what could have been a boring side . all in all , this is a decent recent and a solid choice for a restaurant meal at a decent meal price .		4		1
if you are n't in the mood for the bar / club scene , but want to go out , this is the place for you . you wont spend much more than you would at a bar , the only difference is that you will get live entertainment and laughs at the improv . but not every big name is a hit . for instance , i would n't recommend richard lewis or jay mohr . food is pretty good , i highly recommend the oven baked cookie with ice creme as dessert . yum . the waiting staff are always friendly and attentive . i can always count on improv for a good time , do some research on the comedian and if he seems your style , you and your friends/date will have a great time . as for tickets , if you book online you pay an online fee of some ridiculous $ 3.00 a ticket . call them and see if you can get it cheaper via phone or in person . make sure to arrive at least 30 minutes early . you 'll need more time for special events or just book dinner reservations and you 'll be seated before everyone else .		4		1
carly 's is right down the street from where i live , so we like to come here for a late-night snack . there is usually good parking in the back/along side streets . i have only ever sat in the small tables by the windows . at first you feel really cramped sitting there , with the wait staff trying to punch in orders at the little kiosk behind you , but then you get used to it and realize it 's all part of the ambience . they have great late-night snack options , like grilled quesadillas and some wonderful pita bread with hummus . totally hits the spot for a bread & cheese lover like me . they had a great jazz musician there the first night we went , which added to the urban feel . we tipped him because we liked it so much . the second time there was some sort of comedy slideshow presentation going on where half of the room was chuckling but the other half was n't because we could n't see the screen . but we just ignored it and carried on with our conversation . i ca n't attest to other times of the day , but i enjoy it as a late-night snack .		4		1
i went to dillons planning to have a serious conversation with friends last night , so the food was not top on the list of my priorities . in spite of that i was impressed by the food and the service . i appreciated the fact the server was very knowledgable about was being served . she also gave some real thought to questions concerning the sauces and recommendations we asked her to make . she also kept our drinks flowing moderately including keeping my water glass topped off . as i do n't drink , often times , i end up with a half empty glass which i invariably have to ask to get refilled . not so here ; udos to the server . i had the pulled chicken sandwich which certainly tender enough with a very fresh bun . the mild sauce was about what our server said it would be . next time i will go for something stronger though . concerning the goal of the evening , i was going very mild in everything i ate . the potato salad had a nice flavor but was just a scoop in a little bowl . one of my pet peeves , it just looked boring . what really surprised me as it would have been the last thing i 'd have ever ordered was my friends stew . the stew was a luscious combination of meat and vegetables . it almost looked almost like a thick soup . i like it when something just looks like it would be something i 'd really like to have just seeing it . . my friend said it was as appetizing as it looked . this is what i will have the next time i go there . no problems parking but this was during the middle of the week so do n't know about weekends .		4		1
i had seen the menu for this place laying around at work and i had assumed that it would n't be very good because $ 2.95 for a hamburger ? those are fast food prices ! they ca n't be good quality for that ! my co-workers assured me i was wrong but i took my time checking the place out . that finally changed today when i decided i was bored of every other place i normally go to for lunch and a burger sounded good . i walked in and was greeted right away -lrb- eye contact , smile , everything ! -rrb- . the girl who helped me was friendly and patient as i took my time ordering since i had n't been there before . i ordered the double char with cheese and a side of fries to go . as i was waiting i was happy to see some of the employees going around and wiping counters , sweeping the floors , just doing general cleaning which made me happy because a clean place that serves food is a great place ! my buzzer letting me know my food was ready went off pretty quickly but not so fast that i felt like they just grabbed my burger out from under a heat lamp . the man who gave me my food -lrb- possibly the manager -rrb- made sure to relay my order back to me to make sure it was correct and offered packets of ketchup for my fries . he made eye contact the whole time and was also very friendly . once i had my bag of goods i could n't resist reaching in for a fry -lrb- or possibly two ... -rrb- right away . they were hot , fresh and perfectly cooked ! a nice crunch on the outside but still soft on the outside and the perfect amount of salt . once i bit into my burger i was equally impressed . the meat was cooked about medium so nice and juicy , the cheese was oozing off the sides and the veggies were fresh and perfectly portioned to the burger . i 'm only a little ashamed to admit that i actually finished the whole thing -lrb- which is why my next stop after finishing this review is going to be the gym ... -rrb- because it was so delicious . i will definitely be making the habit one of my habits ! hehe i made a pun !		4		1
i can add mabel 's to my `` really pissed at myself for not trying sooner '' list and to my forthcoming `` scottsdale for grown-ups '' list . the inside is classy with a dark mahogany bar , plush leather armchairs and a fireplace nicely decorated for christmas . it reminds me of the parlour of the stately english manner owned by that distant wealthy english uncle whom i do n't yet know exists -lrb- and will someday leave to me -rrb- . the service is very professional and friendly and the jazz playing in the background adds to the classy ambiance will make you want to linger and absorb . best of all ... their happy hour goes until 9:00 pm during the week . their `` matinee '' menu has a great selection of tapas dishes -lrb- mac n ' cheese , meatballs , deviled eggs , mini-angus burgers -rrb- , cocktails and some fantastic wine selections all prices that wo n't empty your wallet . this is really a gem in scottsdale and a great place to come cozy up away from the bar scene .		4		1
i must admit , i was pleasantly surprised to have thoroughly enjoyed everything i ordered ! i ca n't remember the last time that happened in a restaurant in the valley . to start , the ambiance is non-existent , so if you want to impress a girl on a first date , this is n't the place . however , if you want to eat food that `` wows '' you , woodlands is the place to come . i ordered the samosa as an appetizer , and then the veggie curry , along with an order of malabar parotta bread . the samosa had so many spices in it that it was great on its own , however , there are plenty of delicious chutneys to choose from -lrb- i loved the mint and coconut , there was also a spicy one with chunks of veggies in it that was good -rrb- . the curry was fantastic , spicy and full of flavor . i get annoyed when i order spicy in an indian restaurant , and then after looking at me they serve it to me mild - not here , it was just right . the bread was excellent too , so was the mango lassi , though i really wanted a taj mahal - no alcohol here ! so besides the cafeteria environment and no alcohol or table service , this place is great , because they serve great food .		4		1
a v e r y tasty burger ! yes , at the chuck box i expected very little but got a different friday lunch experience , thats for sure . yes , it is odd that one shouts ones order over a line of waiting patrons to the loud chef in the kitchen - but that just add to the experience . weird - a bit unorthodox - absolutely wrong - not at all then after joining the crowd of hungry , waiting customers i start to checking out the place . red hot fire that the burgers all are braised over makes it kinda genuine in a way . a bar in the centre with all condiments and fixings , is up for grabs once the correct burger has been fetched and paid for . as i stated initially , i got myself a very tasty burger and a small serving of very tasty onion rings . it was friday , so i 'm allowed to . i even liked the crates that substitutes for chairs and makes sure that as long as you are here , you are here to eat . there was a few things that could been improved , -lrb- and the ill manner is n't one of them -rrb- but overall i really enjoyed the chuck box and i will come back . oh yes , i will come back .		4		1
finally got around to checking out this place for lunch time on my day off - they close early so i rarely get to make it to these hip sandwich spots . . despite the tiny menu of items , my friend and i managed to find two sandwhiches that sounded delicious . not sure what to expect for $ 8 , i ordered the tuna and she got the tomato and mozzarella . we also picked up the tea/lemonade which brought us up to a little over $ 11 each . normally my cheap ass does not spend more than $ 5 for lunch -lrb- subway , anyone ? -rrb- so my expectations were high from the second my card was swiped . the sandwiches were made quickly and came packed up to go in a very cute bag . we grabbed a table outside and dug in . the bread that they oven bake is delicious and the sandwich was surprisingly big and filling . the tuna was made without mayo -lrb- which i prefer -rrb- and the tomato/mozzarella was fresh , juicy , and delicious . the tea was refreshing and tart , just how i like it . for $ 8 , i 'd expect at least a bag of kettle chips to go on the side , or something . i find it weird to eat a sandwich without a side , especially without some salt and vinegar chips . this place probably gets quite crowded during the break of lunch , but we went it was n't too bad at 1:30 pm . more seating would be nice , and hopefully they get some misters going for summer lunch patrons cuz you 're right in the sun .		4		1
i 'm starting to appreciate the concept of a little more of an upscale breakfast . long gone are my undergrad days at nau when we 'd stumble into mike and rhonda 's at 6am -lrb- because we 'd been up drinking all night -rrb- and could n't give two shits that the chicken was grossly under-cooked and still partly frozen . so now i 'm a grown-up -lrb- ish -rrb- and popped in here for brekkie the other day . to clarify , when i say `` upscale breakfast '' that means a tiny 4 oz breakfast fillet , two eggs -lrb- i appreciate that they asked if i wanted them poached soft , medium or hard-this made the difference between 3 and 4 stars-well done -lrb- not my steak or eggs !!! -rrb- -rrb- lots of hashbrowns which i ordered as a side , two pieces of toast and some fruit which was all artfully arranged . their fresh squeezed oj was the highlight of the breakfast . everything else was good , not stellar . if you 're looking for value for money , look elsewhere . do n't get me wrong , i left feeling full but some folks may feel cheated when they get the bill , relative to what they got . i personally liked the service , the bright cheery atmosphere and that i left feeling full but not stuffed . another bonus that they gave me a refill on my coffee to go . i keep forgetting that these guys are just a few blocks from my work . this is the kind of place that i would remember if i were visiting phoenix from out of town .		4		1
ok , so i 've been back a few times now and i 'm beginning to see how this place could work . it will definitely take some time for everything to gel . the menu needs work , as does the drink selection . last night i came with a large group of 8-10 people and they all seemed to love the quality of the food , especially the pizzas . i heard complaints about the size of the martinis , especially in light of the prices . i agree with yelper sarah about what seems like a sterile feel to the place at times , but maybe they 're experimenting with the lighting because last night it felt cozier , and darker . i like the music . the main problem is that it 's so large and cavernous that it wo n't appeal to people unless it 's jam-packed , like az88 . if you go there now , it 's dead . my sense is that owner karl kopp has a long-term vision for the place so he 's not worrying about cramming in hordes of people through cheapo deals or gimmicks for now . light rail starts in a couple of weeks and cityscape will be done in about a year , which will continue to change the downtown scene significantly -lrb- cityscape in particular -rrb- , so if he 's trying to simply establish a foothold here while the rest of the area builds up around him , it could turn out to be a smart move . he does seem to know what he 's doing , judging from his places in scottsdale and manhattan . and by the way , i totally deny the slanderous allegations in mrk 's review . when i ditched him at the bar and came home , i honestly did n't expect to have the first to review slot sitting there waiting for me to write it . i 'll admit to ditching his ass . just not for the reason he claims . : -rrb- light rail stop : washington/central or jefferson/1st ave , and a 2-3 minute walk .		4		1
harlows cafe made for a nice brunch this wonderful sunday morning . they were super busy yet for a party of 2 we only waited about 10 or 15 minutes . it was great ! this place has a cozy , cottage , localish feel and you can tell its a popular spot . i was n't fond of our table but it was n't uncomfortable by any means . the server was great with timing whether taking our order , delivering food or grabbing the check . she always topped off our waters -lrb- i am one of those customers who downs their waters quickly ! servers beware -rrb- and was n't annoying in the slightest . the biggest plus i give harlow 's , the portions are perfect when sharing between two people and holy cow , the potato 's were n't swimming in grease on my plate ! hallelujah . i love me some potato 's and its too bad they are nutritionally worthless and so yummy . we ordered the two egg breakfast which comes with potato 's and your choice of a side and we went with rye toast . we also ordered a short stack of blueberry pancakes . it was the perfect amount of food for two and again , the lack of grease was the best thing ever . the pancakes were super soft and they almost melt in your mouth , in the best way . i would love to come here again !		4		1
it 's easy to like the things that everybody else likes . it 's human nature to want to be loved and to want to be accepted . deep in our dna , we are still pack animals -lrb- as in `` a scrum of rugby 's '' , as opposed to pack animals as in `` pack all that crap on that animals back and let 's go '' -rrb- . my sense of needing to belong was what brought me to lolo 's chicken and waffles a few years ago , and my sense of `` i have n't had a decent chicken and waffles fix for a while '' brought me back today ! you wo n't see me wax rhapsodic over the flavor and lightness of the perfectly crusty and delectable fried chicken ... i wo n't fawn over whoever is in the kitchen turning out delicious waffle after delicious waffle . i ca n't sit here all afternoon and go on and on about the many delectable sides like the buttery and cheesy grits , the melt in your mouth fried okra , and the gallons and gallons of sweet tea or homemade lemonade that you can consume with your lunch at lolo 's . it 's not the interesting menu items like fried gizzards , and fish and grits , that you just ca n't get other places that stir my soul . i 'm not moved to hyperbole -lrb- pronounced `` high-per-bowl '' : -rrb- by the blending of sweet maple syrup , buttered waffles and savory fried chicken on the plate . i am not reduced to tears by some of the best red velvet cake to come out of an oven in the greater phoenix area . no , it 's the people at lolo 's that make me go back , and the sense of belonging and of being one of the lolo 's `` pack '' ... that and some of the best fried chicken , waffles , grits and cake that you will ever eat . go to lolo 's ... you 're family , you should drop by once in a while : -rrb-		4		1
i 've only been to la grande orange for pizza , but i plan to come back for breakfast or lunch some time soon since its so close to home . the pizza was pretty darn good , we ordered half gladiator and half fallen angel with all of the free add ons ! this includes garlic , fresno peppers , onions and an egg !! the trick that one of the staff recommended to us -lrb- that we completely forgot yo do but will do next time -rrb- was to have the egg cooked over medium since they typically serve the egg sunny side up which can be too runny for most . i personally liked the gladiator more than the fallen angel . we also decided to go with a growler which you can decide to keep or just drink at the table -lrb- of course we decided to keep it for am extra $ 12 -rrb- . it is such a uniquely shaped growler ! super cute , reminds me of a genie bottle ! the ambiance was very romantic with dim candle lighting and all of the staff was so friendly and helpful ! i am so excited to go here for breakfast or lunch and check out the grocery store !		4		1
meh on the atmosphere . whoa to the food . went here on a saturday night with a friend to grab some grub before going out . it was a nice night so i opted for outdoor seating . i did this after seeing the interior of the place . per the name , i expected to see a place decked out in new york memroblia , photos , newspapers , jerseys , etc. but sadly it looked the inside of a pizza hut . nothing exciting on the walls , just booths and tables . although the space was big and the bar looked pretty stacked , i was n't impressed with the inside . on the back patio , which had iron tables and chairs with a bar playing the giants game -lrb- there 's the festivness i was looking for -rrb- we ordered a side of honey bbq and spicy honey mustard boneless wings . oh sweet mercy , they were good . i love me some boneless wings and they were killer . i drank the kool aid and i am now a believer of why this place is proud of their wings . for dinner i ordered the california clucker . chibata bread , grilled chicken , bacon , a mayo of types , and avacado . served with wide-cut steak fries , it was delish . the bacon was a little too crispy for me , but the avacado was just smushy enough . i could n't finish and saved half for a late night snack . even hours later i was 100 & satisfied . i 'd go back here on a wing special night and just eat my little heart out .		4		1
i was a guest of one of the vips during the recent center stage event , showcasing 4 bands and a selected dinner/drink menu . our seats were directly stage right and we had a great view of the bands that performed throughout the night - all were very very talented and entertaining . i hear they play through the week so i will defiantly return based on the band selection alone . the pre selected menu was quite impressive . our starter was the antipasti which was loaded with a selection of cheese , olives , fig chutney , apricot puree , grilled asparagus , and a mini mound of prosciutto and capicolla - severed with perfectly crisp bread . seriously a meal on its own . our next item was the spicy tuna roll . we had a repeat order on this item or i should admit , i had a repeat order . i ate most of our shared order and the additional round . i love sushi and this was pretty good sushi . i hear the newly installed sushi bar is quite the hit . i 'll be back for that , too . my drink selection for the evening was the prickly pear margarita . i indulged just a tad , if you can call 8 rounds a tad . yup they were that good . we enjoyed a stroll throughout the property post entertainment , dinner and drinks and i was impressed with the layout of the property and the many resort/spa options . hey lookey there , a gondola ride !!!!! got ta try that when the weather cools down for sure . getting that guided tour sure made me feel like an a-lister or it could have been all the margaritas . as such , my plans on my next staycation are in the works .		4		1
this is an easy place to pick for lunch with my work friends . they offer a nice selection of salads where even a half order is too much for one person - like other reviewers , the caramelized peach is my favorite . artichoke and spinach dip is always tasty , pear / gorgonzola pizza is delicious , the new bianco flat bread is tasty , and my lunch companions always get different salads and pizzas and are always pleased . they did switch to sourdough bread for a start - not my favorite but theirs is n't too powerful . i liked the herb oil but that did n't get to our table with the last visit so it might be out already . parking is easy , at least until they replace on the border which is across the `` street '' and the best place to park when you visit . service is mostly good but we have had a couple of bad experiences , not enough to change my opinion though . ask for salad dressing on the side if you 're concerned about getting too much , i 'm not a fanatic but they load it at times and it will turn a nice salad into a drippy slaw . the guy that manages this place during the day does a great job and always looks tired , i would too if i had to deal with running a place like this . it 's a chain and and a tad overpriced ... that being said , it 's a pretty good option when you ca n't figure out what else to do . a true 3.5 but i 'll round it up for how hard they try .		4		1
so fun and yet quite different from the original vig . surrondings - you cant help but love the fact that the bar staff has a shake weight behind the bar ! the white board wall is a total hoot by the end of the night , anything from robots , birthday shout outs , and a overly clever dog with a monocle . food - if you dont have the deconstructed fish taco you are not living . i am not a fish taco or taco salad kind of person but this . . this . . this . . is just so good ! also i heard the burger rocks . staff - although it took a bit for the bartender to get behind the bar , i may have been in during the shift change , she was right there the whole time i was there . always eager to make me smile and get me what i needed . cocktail and applesauce - -lrb- minus the applesauce -rrb- - i have had many on the specialty drink menu and all are good nothing spectacular , n = but decent although kinda on the pricy side . overall - you will have good eats and good fun no matter midday lunch or a night on the town . p.s - if you go late on weekends be sure to dress up !		4		1
what a beautiful setting for luxury dining and sunset watching ! just as the sun is about to set , the electronic shades lift seamlessly and very bond-like to reveal the sun kissed mountains and orange blush sky . people who often say that arizona is dry and barren should come here and see just how different it can be ! memorable food items included : braised short ribs entree with sticky rice , brussel sprout and bacon kimichi with korean bbq sauce . - this is a must order ! duck confit mooshu chickpea crepe appetizer - unique in flavor and texture fiery calamari appetizer - just the right amount of spice lobster bisque -lrb- soup of the day -rrb- - rich and delicious truffle whipped potatoes side dish - addicting and irresistible summer prix fixe : -lrb- this menu changes daily and must be requested -rrb- rock shrimp over pork belly and basil fried rice - really good chicken breast dish over mashed potatoes , but not the truffle whipped potatoes - my friend enjoyed her dish , but also just described it as `` good '' lava cake with vanilla gelato - perfectly done ! our group was celebrating a birthday , so the waitress brought out a special pb bomb dessert on the house with the words , `` happy birthday '' written in chocolate . they also brought out 4 yummy cookies along with our bill . we felt really spoiled by our wonderful , patient waitress -lrb- i say patient because it took us forever to decide what we wanted at first . she did n't rush us and thoroughly explained our dish choices to help us decide what to order -rrb- . thanks elements and staff for making our friend 's birthday so special and memorable !		4		1
country diner alert !! all your breakfast and lunch diner favorites ! we have passed this place literally a million times and kept wondering what the food is like . well we wonder no more . for lunch today we stepped into a bit of what reminds me of an oklahoma diner , i could almost see my country country cousins stopping by this place . the menu is full of classic sandwiches like french dip , monte cristo , hamburgers and other american sandwich staples . the menu is big on breakfast and has lots of omelettes to chose from . they even mark all the low carb items so you for those south beachers it 's a little easier . for starters linda our server was instantly like family , she was sweet and kind . i love the way she talked to my daughter like she already knew her , `` so sammy what are we having today ? '' linda was extra helpful and made great recommendations . she even warned us about the size of portions and boy she was n't kidding . linda did a great job keeping glasses full and prompt service . we noticed in this small establishment there were four servers , whoa that 's rare these days . i had the avocado omelette which is big , with super nice chunks of avocado , no salsa but i never asked for any either . the hash browns were not my favorite style more mashed than chunky but you decide . you can chose yummy fresh made daily biscuits or toast . plus one -lrb- husband -rrb- had the prime rib and eggs breakfast which he could n't finish . the prime rib had good flavor for breakfast not top quality but pretty good , considering we are in a diner . this is one of their specialities and if you are hungry it 's perfect . this also comes with hash browns , eggs , and two humongous cupcake sized biscuits with a well seasoned gravy . if i was n't low carbing it that would have been lunch ! the decor is cute and quaint . the care and thoughtfulness of the staff shines thru.they talk to each customer like they are old friends and some of them were . when you are passing thru no pho give them a try . they are open for lunch and breakfast only .		4		1
three stars for the food , but bumped up a star for the outstanding service . logan 's is a spartan warehouse inside , with the ubiquitous giant pipe ceiling , and cement floors with a chaste smattering of peanut shells . we were seated and then pretty immediately given a few warm yeast rolls with whipped butter . the rolls were just ok - a little tough and yeasty for my taste . hubby thought he had just about died and gone to heaven with the big bucket of roasted and salted peanuts on the table . i had a couple and they were tasty . waters and our drinks came pretty quickly as well . my strawberry margarita was pretty good , and hubby got the most exotic beer they had - killian 's . for our main entrees , hubby had a ny strip and i had a rib-eye . both arrived more medium than the medium rare we ordered , and when the server stopped by to see how things were , hubby said the steaks were a little overdone . he apologized , and asked if we wanted new ones . we said , `` no , '' and that it was ok , we did n't want to be wasteful . a manager was at our table a minute later , asking if we were sure . we were super impressed by this - 10x better service than when we last had complaints at the four seasons . the sides were alright - mushrooms were sliced and in a heavily seasoned broth , loaded baked potato was standard , but hubby just loved his baked sweet potato with butter and cinnamon . at the end of the meal , we were presented with their signature three-tiny-bucket desserts . we had n't ordered it - it was a surprise comp . one bucket was a rich chocolate mousse with a peanut butter top , another was a hella-sweet warm hot-fudge brownie with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream , and the last was a light cheesecake with strawberry topping . they were all tasty , but my favorite was the cheesecake . then we got the bill . they had also given us half off both our steaks . we again were quite impressed . logan 's really went above and beyond to make up for a relatively small error . naturally , we tipped based on what the bill would have been . we 'll be back .		4		1
i 've always sorta had mixed feelings about this theater . on the one hand , there are n't a whole lot of options to see independent film in az besides this place and camelview , so i 've got thank dan harkins for those outlets . on the other hand , there are times when this theater plays the same movie for weeks . an examples of this was with what the bleep do we know ? . i hate it when this place does that , but it 's nice to see films here that would n't normally get play at camelview -lrb- ie . che : parts 1 & 2 , let the right one in , etc. -rrb- . in all , this place is a bit like my own cinema paradiso because i have so many fond memories in this theater . there was a pulp fiction screening when i was in high school and i got to go to an advanced screening of slumdog millionaire and actually got to meet danny boyle when he showed up for a q & a afterward . i just wish they had midnight screenings of classic/grindhouse/cult films like the new beverly in la . .		4		1
finally another downtown lunch option . i 'm viewing this as the `` in-between '' place , in-between arrogant butcher 's heavy on the lawyer , heavy on the political scene diners , and in-between `` celtic-hooters '' , i mean , tilted kilt upstairs . the food menu is interesting , a lot of appetizers . not enough salads for my taste . compared to arrogant butcher and likely tilted kilt , the menu has less salads and less fried foods , but it 'll be hard to find something healthy to eat . it veers towards the comfort food side , with options like chili with cornbread souffle , and flatbreads served with burrata fondue . there are a few flat bread options on the menu which is their version of pizza . the day i went , the lunch room was busy . -lrb- you enter in through the a lobby shared with stand up live -rrb- . did n't get a chance to try out their amazing beer selection , will have to try that out the next time i 'm here for a show . the management and service is very friendly . -lrb- not in a scary way , just in a `` i really want to enjoy your experience way -rrb- . this is in sharp contrast to the service at lucky strike across the way which i 've found to be downright rude at times . keeping my fingers crossed that they continue to do well .		4		1
i 'm surprised to see the low ratings for this place . i think it 's fantastic !! there 's still not a whole lot going on in this area . it 's still cow-town , farming central for gilbert , although a lot has popped up recently . when this restaurant rolled into town , i was thrilled . first , they try to get all their produce from their local farm 1st . if they ca n't supply everything for their restaurant from their farm , they buy from local farmers 2nd , and then -lrb- and only then -rrb- will they go out-of-state for their produce . also , their meat is naturally raised from az . . local produce + local meat = are you kidding me ?!?! they deserve 5 stars for that alone ! they also have recycling bins for your cups and plates . if more restaurants would follow suit in these aspects , do you know how much waste can be saved , or how much this boosts our local economy , or how much healthier we would be as a society ? supporting business that buy locally is not only far nutritionally superior because the transit time decreases , but people generally do n't get a side of pesticides , herbicides , hormones , and antibiotics with their meal when you buy locally . so , a + + + for the fact that joe 's farm grill has gotten on board with this and really taken it above and beyond what most establishments in this price range are willing to do , or even want to do . i did n't know they had naturally raised meat until i caught it on the food network , and that made me even happier . i 've always been amazed at their charbroiled hamburgers - they 've been some of the best i 've had . the fries are groovy too . i 've had a salad as well as the grilled cheese . the salad was large and delicious but there was something lurking in it that was making it taste `` strange . '' i think it was just my own personal preference though . the grilled cheese had fontina in it , and as i found out the hard way , fontina is gross . i should have known ... i do n't like weird cheeses on traditional american white trash food . they taste like dirty socks in my mouth . if i knew what fontina tasted like i would n't have gotten it , that 's my bad . it 's more expensive than your average fancier burger joint , but nothing too outrageous . it 's fun to sit outside on a cool day under the gigantic trees , and look out to the farm and houses think to yourself that one day , not too long ago , all of it was farm land as far as the eye could see .		4		1
my experience at this portillo 's was 10x better than at the n. scottsdale location . maybe they learned from that opening ? but i found the quality to be much better . we must have missed the dinner rush because i quickly found a parking spot and there was n't a wait to order . we walked in and they had some workers out in the ordering area taking pre-orders . i decided to try the italian beef sandwich and the boy got the italian sausage sandwich and a chili dog . we shared an order of fries . you order and then walk down the ways to wait for your order to be called . it took about 5 minutes to get our food -lrb- fast - too fast ? -rrb- we got our condiments and dug in . i really liked my sandwich , get it with the hot peppers if you 're into it . the fries were crisp and perfectly salted . my one complaint is that the sandwich was probably sitting so some of the bread was soggy . my bf thought the hot dog was okay . in my opinion all hot dogs are `` okay '' unless we 're talking about short leash so take that with a grain of salt . we ended with a chocolate cake shake that my boyfriend had n't yet experienced the delights of - he tried to drink it all so that 's that . i 'll be back		4		1
i had high hopes for lux partly because of my desire for independent and unique businesses to succeed but also because i 'm an italophile who loves real espresso and secretly wishes she could wake up every morning in rome , walk down to the neighborhood bar , and grab a cornetto -lrb- italian version of croissant -rrb- and a rich , deep espresso . since i obviously ca n't do that , i am always hoping that i can find a place locally that can re-create that nonchalant but cultured atmosphere so prevalent in european establishments and , of course , make some damn good espresso . lux definitely gets some points for approximating the refined but casual feel of cafes and coffee shops in places like new york and paris , and i very much appreciate places that remind us that eating and drinking are just as much an experience as they are about refueling quickly before we go off to our next daily task . however , because `` la dolce vita '' is not just about atmosphere but is also about taste and quality , i have to express my disappointment in the espresso we were served . it just was n't that good . it was quite bitter , in fact , and it left a bit of a bad aftertaste in my mouth . i kind of expected more from the hype -lrb- and from the fact that i paid $ 2.50 for it -rrb- . to be fair to lux , i 've been back since and the espresso and americanos were much better on my subsequent visits . in any event , it 's always nice to take a break from the frenzied pace of life and to avoid the starbucks drive-thrus as much as possible .		4		1
i like centurion . it 's got more space now after their expansion , and it 's a quirky , unusual experience . you feel really close to the kitchen and chefs , and the food is always good . it 's terrific that after 5pm weekday and all day saturday and sunday , street parking is completely free -lrb- so no need to add coins -rrb- . trust me , i live downtown . their 7 course tasting menu is unbelievably tasty -lrb- $ 50 for food only , $ 75 with wine pairings -rrb- . the 21 % gratuity they automatically add though is highly annoying -lrb- 15 % is fine , 18 % okay , but 21 % is a mugging -rrb- . service is good . their risotto of the day is unbelievable -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- . they make the best risotto in all of phoenix , in my opinion , and are creative their pizzas are good too , but maybe a dollar or two too expensive . their mussels are also a standout and fairly priced . personally , i 'd stick with the three above for an everyday dinner , and the tasting menu for a special occasion like an anniversary . their brunch is also fun .		4		1
more vinyl than dita von teese 's closet . if you can imagine . man , they really cram the lp 's into every nook and cranny . i took my friends ' here as they are huge music buffs , especially alternative stuff . me ? pretty mainstream and very 80s ... think cyndi lauper , talking heads and madonna . but they found some they must be giants and other obscure bands mama never heard of . two things struck me as interesting here : 1 -rrb- when rickie asked the clerk if she could suggest any music they may have he could use for a runway show , she quickly and without thought , said , `` i have no idea . '' alrighty then slacker ! 2 -rrb- i saw two packages of pencils , for sale , hanging on the wall . when i asked her why they sold pencils she quickly and without thought , said , `` well , cuz we 're an art supply store you know ? '' nope . did n't know that slacker . sorry to disturb your vertical nap . but for all you music lovers , looking for some oldies but goodies , i would imagine this is a very cool place to get your vinyl swag . and if you do go , give lil miss sunshine a hug for me .		4		1
the sushi quest continues . and we decided to check out one of the more promising places in the east valley . so we rolled into shimogamo , a small place next to c-fu gourmet and across the street from lee lee market . with neighbors this asian , they have to be legit , right ? the first thing i noticed was a nice list of fish and roll options , but a limited set of specials . that 's fine , maybe we can see if there 's anything they 're not telling us about ... or ask the chef to make us something interesting . we started with the beef carpaccio . carpaccio is typically thinly sliced meat , served raw with some marinade , scallions , and other garnishes . this one was supposed to be seared , but it came out medium . it was pretty good , but could have been much better if it were actually served rare . next , we had something we asked the chef to surprise us with . disappointingly , the chef did n't come over and tell us what he made , and the waitress did n't seem to know . but it involved a tempura-fried whitefish on a bed of japanese veggies and a tough of tobiko . it was good , but we were definitely hoping for something a little more interesting . probably the least memorable surprise we 've had from a sushi chef yet . next , we had albacore and escolar sushi . they were both good , and came garnished , so i did n't add any soy sauce to those ... and they were conveniently on the happy hour menu . bonus ! we had a spider roll afterwards , and while i 'm not usually a fan of rolls , i always like a good soft-shelled crab . this one was better than some of the others i 've had , on account of the fact that it also had avocado . the waitress then brought us our shrimp sashimi -lrb- with the fried shrimp heads - make sure you ask for that if you order the fresh shrimp ! -rrb- . these shrimp were huge , and fresh . plus , as an added bonus , the heads came stuffed to the brim with `` goodies . '' i 'm not exactly sure what the goodies are , but they have a distinct flavor , and i suspect it is a mix of central nervous system and the free-form liver/pancreatic capabilities that most crustaceans are endowed with . we had the tuna poke , which seems to be shimogamo 's signature dish . it tastes great , but it is quite basic . basically just tuna and avocado topped with a lightly fried quail egg . this is one of those times when `` less is more '' is true . after this , we had another item on the specials board , the orange yellowtail . this is yellowtail sashimi marinaded with citrus flavor , served with sliced avocado and a touch of sriracha . this was actually pretty delicious . finally , we finished with salmon roe and scallop nigiri , and quail eggs . the salmon roe was some of the best i 've had in awhile -lrb- they did n't have that fishy flavor that you sometimes get at a place with limited quality control -rrb- . unfortunately , a few of the things we wanted to order were not available . they did n't have any uni , baby yellowtail , or toro , which was really quite a bummer . the owner explained to us that the market price is simply too high right now for him to be able to avoid throwing a bunch out , so i appreciate his willingness to only serve what he can guarantee to be fresh . some of this is the fault of their clientele , who from what i could tell , is very caucasian , and might not be interested in paying top dollar for a great cut of fish . my final verdict on shimogamo is that it 's good , but a clear step below the best sushi places i 've been to . everything was fresh , and the dishes were well-executed . furthermore , the prices were reasonable . all of these make it a very respectable location , and potentially the best in the east valley -lrb- we 'll have to try the competition , of course -rrb- . where they fall short is in two areas : first , the menu -lrb- and it seems the chefs -rrb- lack creativity . they do a limited set of dishes well , but they do n't seem to be food artists . it 's a little too generic . second , the waitress did n't seem very knowledgeable about some of the menu items , and had to ask the chef about a few things . if she is relatively new , i could give her a pass . shimogamo may compete for the `` best in east valley '' subcategory , but it ca n't quite hang in the top tier .		4		1
i used to describe tempe marketplace to tourists as `` a large , outdoor mall with a little bit of everything , including over 25 restaurants '' -lrb- i was trying to sell them on coming here rather than make me drive them all the way to arizona mills ... that 's another story -rrb- . at first they 'd gasp that i 'm recommending they walk around outside in between stores ! then somebody would remind them that 10 months out of the year , the weather is great for that . and during those other two months , there are misters aplenty . to address a previous review regarding needing to drive from one side to another due to how spread out it is : are n't all malls that way ? there 's the main building , but the stores and restaurants surrounding the mall `` campus '' -lrb- like target , red lobster or holiday inn -rrb- are outside the radius of the main parking lot . if anything , i think tmp solved that ; the outside stores are in a strip forming an l shape around the sw side , and the more mall-esque area is in the middle , away from parking . other random restaurants are dotted throughout the north end of the mall . the selection of stores and food is vast . seafood , sushi , burgers , dessert , steak , mexican , alcohol , and more . there are big stores like target , jc penny and michaels , lots of smaller boutique clothing stores , and several random shops . the harkins there is great , and is home to the cine capri . all around , it 's a great marketplace for arizona !		4		1
we were in search of thai or chinese on christmas eve night , and stopped into thai hut . i actually have been avoiding this place since reading some reviews describing some downright atrocious service as of late . however , we stopped in at 9.05 -lrb- the sign said closed at 9.00 -rrb- and were told as long as we ordered take-out it was okay . now , i 've worked long enough in the restaurant industry to feel incredibly guilty about ordering even ten minutes before the official closing time . i have been the victim of a -lrb- wonderful but demanding -rrb- restaurant owner who stayed open 10 , 20 , 30 minutes past when you thought you 'd be long gone and well on your way towards an evening of lord knows what . however , about 7 other people came in after us , which made me feel -lrb- almost all -rrb- better . we had planned on having a beer at the counter but decided to make it quick . our fried rice was delish , though mine was a little bit brown -lrb- too much oil ??? -rrb- . at any rate , it tasted fantastic . maybe the quality of service depends on who is in charge ? this time it was a very no-nonsense woman .		4		1
i really like o.h.s.o. made sure that we got here in time for happy hour and to get a place on the patio . walking in there are doggie treats for free , should you have a doggie ! the smell of pretzels , i am assuming , wafts thru the place and gives you the want for a large pretzel and beer . free valet and friendly hops to take your ride away . the pitchers of any arizona brews are $ 6 ... good price on the smaller pitcher for two and a good way to get a sampling without too much of a commitment . could have been alot colder . nothing worse than beer that is n't icy . . in my opinion , at least . we started with apps of the hh smaller bites . i loved the pretzel and cheese dip/fondue . could have given me a warm pitcher of that ! we also had the ohso green chile dip . . not a thing wrong with it and the yucca chips are a treat . i 'm a fan with the exception of the beer not icy thing and letting my water go dry . picky picky ! but a huge offering of brews on a nice patio is a good , good thing !		4		1
after one visit here , i was a huge fan of this new aaron may installation that puts an eccentric twist on pub fare . not to mention , i had one of the most incredible burgers here . with no craft cocktail list to be found here , i looked to the list of drafts and beers by the bottle , which really impressed with the first draft selection a king ludwig white beer from bavaria . the diverse list includes outstanding selections such as trappist belgians , lambics , ales from coast to coast , and many outstanding german beers . one can order a flight of four different beers ranging from $ 5 - $ 8 , so this is also a terrific location to reignite the flames of beer passion . but the food !!!!! we started with the lump crab corn and bacon dip , which was a unique spin on the crab artichoke dip , but lacked a pinch of flavor to make it memorable . however , the crispy potatoes tossed with truffle aoli , shaved parmesan , and chives had our tastebuds singing . the truffle aoli makes it worth the $ 9 price . the crispy pig ear came next , and although the flavors of lime and sea salt mixed with chili gave it a wonderful savor , the texture of the cartilagenous ears did not bring us past the first nibble . lobster tacos came next , which would have been incredible had the lobster not been delivered tempura style on the taco . with cabbage , pico , and creme fraiche it was a very simple dish - but for $ 14 could have been more spectacular . but the brussel sprouts with lemon and thyme more than made up for the lobster tacos . gorgeously seasoned , beautifully cooked , we were in love ! so ultimately the coup de gras of this visit was the praying monk burger . what a phenomenal burger , using beef that is world renowned for its quality , an onion bun from local karsh bakery , and cooked to perfection . with a sriracha mayo that gave it a unique flavor kick , finished with caramelized onion and topped with melted vermont cheddar , it was one of the most delicious burgers i have had in the valley . chef aaron may really knows how to cook a piece of meat ! finally , the space is all dark wood , open ceilings , and an incredible atmosphere created by the chill lounge beats and downtempo tracks pumping through the speakers . happy hour is everyday from 3-7pm with 1/2 priced appetizers , $ 3 monk 's pale ale , $ 3 new belgium blue paddle , $ 4 premium well cocktails , $ 5 house red and white wine - so an excellent opportunity to get to know the exciting pub fare and fantastic beer selection . furthermore , on saturday nights is midnight mass where at the stroke of midnight you receive the same drink as is in your possession for the simple `` tithing '' of one dollar . i recommend sitting at the bar , where service is quick and friendly and you can more easily navigate the menu options with your bartender . i highly recommend this place for happy hours , casual dinners , or a fantastic spot to start off a night on the town .		4		1
imagine your a hungry lion , locked in a shopping mall full of people . they are athletic , unarmed , and some of them have been good enough to coat themselves in a1 or barbecue sauce . welcome to the fogo de chao experience . meat orgy ! it 's absolutely magnificent , take over half a dozen different piping hot well prepared varieties of meat including top sirloin , bottom sirloin , filet mignon , pork loin , beef ribs , pork ribs , and lamb stuffed onto skewers that could double as props for a film about roman gladiators . hand said savory redolent skewers to an assorted band of servers that seem to dance in and out of crowded tables full of people with amazing ease all at the beck and call of a little piece of paper . it 's fantastic ! they have wonderful sides as well including caramelized bananas , polenta , and garlic mashed potatoes . there is also a salad bar , and i think it was nice but quite honestly was n't the analogy about the damn lion the point here ? happy hunting .		4		1
thank you , pappadeaux , for giving us landlocked phoenicians a nice seafood place that does n't break the bank . the relatives from up north were coming to town and the request was for those classicly native phoenician foods , lobster and crab legs . there were going to be 8 of us , and i was getting ready to take out the $ 1,000 bank loan when yelp pointed me to pappadeaux . thank goodness they take reservations for 8 or more . i 'm all over it . turns out it was crawdad night -lrb- crawfish for you cultured creoles -rrb- , and the place was an absolute madhouse . we lucked out finding a parking spot and slowly made our way through the crush of people waiting outside . i lost my entire party in the crowd and by the time i made it to the hostess desk was sure our reservation was a goner . but the disheveled hostess , who probably suffers from ptsd after that night , said we were good . whew . i sent a rescue crew to retrieve my lost troops . it was incredibly noisy so we had to do some strategic table placement for the hard of hearing . the service was impeccable . demands for substitutions , butter sent back because it was too salty , help needed for seafood haters - our waiter fielded them all calmly and accommodated even the pickiest requests . everyone loved their food , which really was very good . i got my favorite banana pudding - who needs an entree , really . the bill was reasonable and everyone was happy . another mission accomplished , another bullet dodged .		4		1
i saw oh no ! oh my ! play here . and band of annuals . and eternal 42 . maybe joy electric . but i ca n't be so sure . once i learned about the `` red cup rule '' -lrb- booze can be brought in as long as it 's in a plastic red cup -rrb- , all of my experiences at modified became one long haze of noise and staring intently at paintings and going `` i see ... yes ... very interesting . '' the modified was like the `` seedy bar/club '' cliche in every movie you ever saw . you could n't get within ten feet of the building without being pwned in the face with the scent of b.o. and pot . there are homeless people on the patio , lushes on the sidewalk , and a very disinterested door guy who does n't even look up from his book to stamp your hand with some socio-political metaphor . amidst all the decay and broken glass there was -lrb- and still is , why the fuck do i keep switching tenses ? -rrb- something really special . the bands that came -lrb- come -rrb- are n't always the biggest and most well known . because if they were , they 'd be playing the marquee . but the shows are always worth watching . even if the bands suck -lrb- and trust me , a lot of them do -rrb- , the energy exchange between them and the crowd is intense . i 've seen people go entire shows clapping in rhythm with the songs . i 've seen people cry . i 've even people engage in group hugs and collapse to the ground . ... indie kids . unlike other venues , people came to the modified to be seen -lrb- or it is scene ? get it ? fuck you -rrb- . you never learned their names , but you could spot them in a crowd . girl with crazy hair . boy who wore a little too much makeup for it to be `` ironic '' . girl that always smelled really good . guy who always wanted to help the band move their gear . i often wonder what my `` scenester '' nickname would be ... yes , it 's dirty . yes it 's cramped . and yes , if you try to pee near the dumpster the guy who owns the restaurant next door will yell at you in chinese . but after all of phoenix is gentrified into submission , and all the art galleries and performance venues are bulldozed over to make way for more strip malls and high-end shopping outlets -lrb- with the occasional starbucks dotted in to `` give it culture '' -rrb- , we will have wished we had visited it more often . oh well . maybe the phoenix art museum will put in a performance venue . `` hello phoenix ! i want to hear all of you singing along on this one ! even you , guy pretending to make sense of that monet . alright , let 's go ! ''		4		1
it took me a long time to get around to reviewing camelview 5 and i think it 's just because i had mixed emotions at first . it 's a little too corporate , i suppose , and since it 's pretty much the only theater in town that you know for sure is going to have movies first released in limited theaters , it 's going to be packed . i ca n't really fault it for that . i 'm not sure what it is , but i 've never been too crazy about coming here . the smaller theaters ? i dunno . maybe it 's because what i really want is an independently run theater that allows me the opportunity to get a chance to see 127 hours or moon when it 's still fresh and brand new ? that would be the dream , but until then , this theater is amazing to have around . plus , i get to use my loyalty cup for $ 1 sodas , so the whole conglomeration thing is n't all bad . if you 're excited about a movie coming out , but you know it 'll either take a few months to make it to more mainstream movies , or maybe even fizzle out and appear on dvd , this is your go-to place -lrb- a serious man , the maid , son of rambow , broken embraces , black swan -rrb- . watch out for olds ! they 'll take forever at the box office and sometimes when you get up to pee , you 'll have to old the door for like six fogies .		4		1
cracker barrel is so dependable for down-home american comfort food ! my boyfriend and i were in phoenix , heading back to our part of town on i-10 . we decided cracker barrel would be the perfect stop for brunch . the wait was 25 minutes that sunday around 1pm . we did n't mind , because we spent that time perusing the old-fashioned candy and timeless children 's games in the gift shop area . i also love checking out the latest and greatest kitchen gadgets and decorative plates , etc. in the gift shop . i purchased a cute muffin pan with a snap-on lid perfect for bringing baked goods to work ! the food was outstanding and definitely fresh . i love the apple cider in a mug too ! mmm i think that 's my favorite thing on the whole menu ! i ca n't get enough of that tasty cider ! the biscuits are so yummy too ! cracker barrel food never disappoints me . the service was a bit short , since they were so busy , and that was n't too cool , but i 'm still giving this review 4 stars , because service is usually much better at this location .		4		1
i completely have to thank yelp for this one . i work around the scottsdale airpark and i did n't even know this place existed until i did a little yelping . the food is definitely on point with what the other reviews are saying , and i was very pleased . when i got there for lunch , there was a line to the door . i was grateful though because i had no idea what to order . i 'm serious too because that usually does n't happen to me at a mexican restaurant . their special sounded great as did pretty much everything else . i decided to go with the delicious sounding blackened chicken burrito and an order of chips and salsa -lrb- kind of a must for me at a new mexican place -rrb- . the chips were pretty standard , but crispy and yummy , and the salsas were great ! we were given a verde , a regular -lrb- red with lots of pepper flavor -rrb- and their version of a spicy salsa . i believe the latter had habaneros in it ; it lacked a little in flavor but definitely packed a little bite . overall the salsas were very good ; i even threw some on my burrito . speaking of that , the burrito was great ! it was n't filling like any of the berto places , but instead , just right . in other words , i did n't feel too guilty about it . the chicken was awesome and the other fillings -lrb- rice , pico and chipotle sauce -rrb- brought it all together very nicely . i 've for sure added this place to my list of lunch spots . i can see why it gets great reviews , but i can also see why people are hesitant to boast about it . it 's a well-kept secret tucked away in the depths of north scottsdale that is becoming less of one day after day .		4		1
my mom came to town to help me out with surgery and on her last night we wanted to go out somewhere for a good dinner to celebrate me feeling better . after a bit of thinking i remember this place . we came here durring happy hour which was great as they have some great prices especially for the quality . the nigiri here is phenomenal we had both escolar and albacore both of which were amazing . surprisingly the escolar was cooked -lrb- with hand held torch -rrb- but had amazing flavor and great texture -lrb- and i am not a big fan of cooked sushi -rrb- . we also had the crazy roll -lrb- half off for happy hour -rrb- , the big and spicy roll -lrb- still great -rrb- , a negi-yellowtail -lrb- not chopped up like most places just shashimi cuts with scallion and wrapped -rrb- , and i had a spicy tuna hand roll . all of it was great and the fish quality top notch . we also had the house cold sake -lrb- too sweet for my taste but not bad -rrb- . the only downsides were the miso was again a bit cold -lrb- the tofu is not soaked in the the soup but tossed in cold -rrb- . and also there was an odd smell that i am pretty sure is from the fish joint next door but not from here . for the 2 of us with the sake it was $ 50 and worth it all . as for price it is about the same i expect for a dinner from ra , kona , sakana , ect but the quality of fish is so much higher and the taste is way better . have to say shimogamo is rapidly becoming my favorite sushi place in the valley		4		1
i love this hotel and its accompanying restaurant , gallo blanco , so much that i spent my wedding night here . the small boutique hotel is a phoenix gem and you wo n't be disappointed with a stay here , which will be unique and memorable . the lobby is colourful and welcoming , with the restaurant bar just steps away , and several couches to lounge on while you have a drink or to meet friends , and the staff is quick and efficient . the rooms are good sized and provide all the accommodations you 're used to . ours had a separate sitting room for the tv and sofa , and the bedroom had simply the bed and bathroom . but the real do - not-miss of this hotel is the pool and roof deck -lrb- after the restaurant of course ! -rrb- . after breakfast at gb , we headed straight to the pool and called some friends to join us -lrb- i believe the limit is 4 passes , but no one questioned us and we did n't notify anyone about our friends coming -rrb- . the pool area is gorgeous , with a glass water wall , a brightly tiled and huge hot tub and sparkly lights glimmering from the bottom of the pool . comfy gravity chairs and cushioned `` beds '' are available -lrb- but go fast -rrb- . as with any hotel pool , drinks are pricey -lrb- there 's no outside bar and we constantly came in dripping wet to order at the lobby bar -rrb- and we spent a small fortune day drinking at the pool . our only complaint , which i assume is a one-off , is that we were promised towels all day and none ever materialised . after dinner at gb -lrb- yes , i totally ate there twice in one day -rrb- , we headed up to the roof top deck to watch the sunset and take in the view of phoenix city skyline . it was an absolutely perfect stay and day with our out of town friends loving it , and as a testament to its popularity , i ran into friends in the lobby at both check in and check out . notes : some reviews say this is close to the light rail and other restaurants but i 'd say it 's set pretty far back from central ave -lrb- almost a mile -rrb- where most of those nicer places and the lr station is . you wo n't be able to easily walk especially in the summer . after reading the other reviews this $ 20 resort fee came back to me . we had received the hotel stay as a wedding gift , so it was a pain to be surprised by the fee not to mention we did n't get any free snacks , no pool towels and certainly not any sunscreen or gift card toward a future stay . how lame !		4		1
i 've experienced postino two different ways in the past two weeks : a late night visit for tea and sparkling wine and a few days later to grab pick up for my boss and myself . the first visit was a nice intro , i like the location , tucked in on campbell , and the interior design is cozy -lrb- fab chandelier ! -rrb- . the retail wine area at the entrance is awkward to me , because it 's cramped and i frankly think you should all be buying wine at my shop so perhaps i 'm a touch biased . anyway , it is a great way for you to take home whatever you enjoyed with your dinner . damn magnanimity . i was n't in the mood for drunk biking that night so i skipped the adult beverages for a pot of tea . i get that this is a wine cafe so really no one going here is going to review a cup of tea , except for me . tea selection was sad . tea has the same cult following that wine does , so three options seemed half-hearted . and my pot of hot water was only half filled , which , for $ 2.50 is lame . okay i 'm done bashing pw . the second time i drove in for a take out order of the bruschetta board . my order was ready , the place was packed and i was able to get in and out in less than 3 mins ! we ordered the date and pistachio on ricotta , the fig and prosciutto , the mozz/tomato/basil and the smoked salmon pesto . great value to order ratio , each slice was huge and pre-chopped into littler bites . the smoked salmon was definitely my favorite , with the runner up being the pistachio/date combo . the mtb was a little dry for me and i do n't eat prosciutto so that was for my boss . i love that they have neighborhood night deals and that you can friend them on facebook and get a special word of the day to get $ 5 glasses of wine no matter what time of night !		4		1
there 's a weird disconnect with me when i walk into this museum to see instruments , whose sole purpose is to be played and enjoyed , displayed for you to stare at while they stay silent . granted , i 'm sure a lot of these instruments are not playable anymore , and they do have stations where you can listen to the tv footage of some -lrb- but not all -rrb- of the instruments when they are played . but , i have a constant urge to pluck strings , play keyboards , and pound on drums when i see them laid out like they have been uncovered at an archaeological dig . it 's true they do have a `` touch and play '' section on the first floor , but the selection is limited -lrb- i 'd imagine because of the upkeep to maintain constantly played instruments that instrument neophytes are trying out -rrb- . despite the overwhelming urge to try out the museum exhibitions , there is a great variety of instruments to look at , laid out by region , with information stands to inform you about the history of said instruments . pretty fascinating to see how different instruments emerge in our cultures and what sounds are deemed `` pleasant '' vs. cacophony . one of the things that i think would make the museum experience more pleasant would be to extend the range of the ear sets they give you , because generally you can only stand in one spot before the headset reception starts to fade , which makes it inconvenient to listen to the instrument samples when there are lots of visitors at the exhibit .		4		1
great atmosphere , good food and service , prices are reasonable ... but why not great ? my friend ordered her chili hatch burger cooked medium and it was served rare . she did not notice until i did and was so hungry that she decided to eat it and only bring it to the server 's attention versus complain . i had the grilled chicken sandwich and it came piled high on `` beach '' toast with layers of avocado , tomato , havarti cheese and sprouts ... it was a delicious monster of flavors and came with sweet tater tots -lrb- you also have the choice of french fries -rrb- which were to die for . shame on me , i also ordered a chocolate lava shake which was delicious and not too sweet . the shake was served in a tall glass topped with whipped cream and m & m 's . the restaurant itself is not pretentious at all and rather casual in atmosphere sporting surfboards against the wall and cycles hanging from the ceiling . overall , it was a nice experience , a good discovery and a nice change from the other burger joints . i enjoyed the fact that rbt is more of a sit down place versus standing in line to have to order your food . it 's also nice that the burgers and sandwiches come with a choice of fries versus having to pay extra for them . the restaurant also has a full bar and a heated patio .		4		1
met some friends for easter dinner here . i thought it would be packed , but it was n't . since i had n't had meat for a while , i was looking forward to this dinner . after browsing the menu , i decided to go for the porcini rubbed filet mignon -lrb- center cut , grilled high country asparagus spears , gorgonzola cream sauce -rrb- . for a side dish , i selected the chipotle mac & cheese . my friends ordered a bottle of wine and we were good to go ! the filet was soooo good ! the gorgonzola cream sauce added a rich , creamy flavor to the succulent center cut filet . i requested it medium and it was cooked to perfection . the chipotle mac & cheese was a perfect complement to the filet ... i highly recommend it . the service was pretty good to . our glasses of wine were never empty and we ordered a chocolate lava cake w/vanilla ice cream & whipped cream and split it between the 3 of us . it was awesome ! overall , it was a great dinner with good friends . return factor - 100 %		4		1
i had to check out the iphone 4 , so went to the apple store , now i am not a mac guy - all of my laptops and pc 's are windows , even though i have an iphone . so it was really interesting going into the store . between their laptops , iphones , and ipads , i was impressed . more importantly , they seem to have customer service - which can not be said of microsoft . on entering the store , there is a greeter , that kind of steers you in the right direction . after browsing their hardware , i wandered over the genius sections , where technicians helped people with their problems . now granted , apple has it easy since they do limit their os to their own hardware - the technicians do not have to know the ins and outs of all the different computers or their incompatibilities - they just have to deal with hardware and software they are familiar with . but they did appear knowledgeable , and did have very good social skills in dealing with people . not only that , if it was something that was easily solved , there was no charge . it was refreshing . there was no high pressure sales persons , just staff that were proud of their products , and eager to show them off . now i have to go to the microsoft store and see how it compares !!		4		1
i 'm glad to see that chef payton curry was able to take his knowledge from working at various establishments around the valley -lrb- i fondly remember his time at caffe boa -rrb- and produce one exceptional eating establishment . i went here on a friday , with my gang of regulars , who are one picky bunch , and they loved this place . the wait person knew her stuff , the service was quick and overall , the food was wonderful . we started out with a pretzel and unlike what i get when i went to to handlebar grill , which are more like pretzel rolls , this was a real pretzel , though it seems made with whole wheat instead of white flour but got a big thumbs up from my culinary focus group . even better , the establishment makes their own sauces and mustards so along with the obligatory beer cheese i had a wonderful whole grain mustard to use as well so it was like being back in germany ! i and another person went for the lamb sausage and it was great ! it was a good size and nestled in a chunk of soft and chewy french bread , and i topped it with more of that wonderful mustard , along with sauerkraut and spicy peppers . the nice thing , the sausage was cooked but not overcooked so it was still juicy and it had a strong lamb flavor . as i noted before , unlike a softer bun the french roll bread held together to the end . another person at my table had the rabbit sausage and said it was great and the last , the last person was a vegetarian and had the black bean burger and boy , it looked excellent ! i would love to try that , once i 've made it through all the sausages on the menu ! the only thing that stood out as needing work was what was referred to as belgian fries , which are generally thick cut and twice fried for a crispy outside and creamy interior but these were more like shoe string fries . chef payton , work on those fries ! if the fries rise to the level of actual belgian fries i will happily give this place five stars . in this case , the brat haus may want to go check out the fries at handle bar and grill , which are closer , from my perspective , to actual belgian fries . bottom line , to quote the terminator , i 'll be back and next time , not on a work day so i can check out the beer selection i see so many other people raving about ! : -- rrb - by the way , if you like the sausages you can buy fresh ones to take home so you can grill your own .		4		1
150th yelp review !! woot woot !!! it 's a sunday afternoon date , which was nice because the weekend was action packed for me , so a lunch date was just right . he picked the place , i do like that when the man picks the place and he even scores big points with me because it was n't a chain restaurant , not that he would know that i 'm on this only eating at local places & yelp about it mission this year lol . i did n't ask him where we were headed but was pleasantly surprised because we were at the cofco chinese cultural center , never been and have always wanted to go check out , was kinda disappointed in how small it was . walked around and checked out a few things still was n't sure of the reason we were here , then we walked into szechwan palace and i thought gosh this is cute little place . from the time we walked in i got the feeling he was a regular their and wondered how many of his dates he brought here lol the ladies were happy to see him and were talking with him , i of course had no clue what was being said cuz they all were talking in chinese . got to our table , had a very hard time trying to figure out what i wanted to try , i found lots of dishes that i wanted , he order chicken fried rice , i would up ordering mongolian beef extra spicy . order came out and it smelled delish , and being a crazy obsessed yelper that i am i picked up my phone , turned the plate around to the best view and started to take pictures of the dish , date looked at me funny but did n't ask , guess his other dates do n't take pics of their food lol i could see the coating of the red chili oil on the beef and onions , the beef was tender and onions and peppers were perfect , only thing it was missing the heat of the spice . but i finished the entire dish , it was that good ! next time i want to try beef with jalapeno , i bet that dish packs some heat ! i look forward to coming back and trying out more of their menu , glad to have finally made it over to the cultural center ! food was delish , date went well , and it was a good day . also when i checked in on yelp , was offered a free desert with any entree , i 'm saving that for another time !		4		1
the aroma of flame broiled meat envelopes you upon entering . it 's a glorious smell to a practicing carnivore , one prompting you to salivate like a st. bernard on a hot summer 's day . there 's a window where you order , and after a short wait , they 'll call you to pick up your order by name . i like this concept since i typically opt for a name out of the ordinary ... today i was thorgon . the ` fixin 's bar is an old covered wagon and has a fun feel to it . condiments are plenty with the layout similar to fuddrucker 's . lot of tv 's abound if sporting events are your thing , since all appeared to be tuned to some type of sporting event . the burger was spectacular , inexpensive and very filling , but the aroma , that smell wafting through your neighborhood that has you wondering which of your neighbors is barbecuing sunday afternoon , is the smell that 'll keep you coming back here for more . in a word , it 's glorious .		4		1
so happy that groupon helped me discover the smg ! as a previous fan of farrelli 's , i was so sad our go-to date night place went out of business , but i am happy again thanks to discovering we have a new go-to place for a cheap dinner and a movie night . for $ 5 each the hubs and i got to see a movie and get a drink ... what a deal ! we used to go to this theater when we were in high school ... it was the cool place then , but over the years it 's become run down and old . now that smg has come in to revitalize it , the place is better than ever . loved the modern look and feel . the bar look inviting , but we choose to just sit and wait till we were called back to our theater , which i found a little odd , but did n't mind . once we went back , we picked a seat . the office type chairs were a little weird , but they were comfortable so i did n't mind . i liked the set up better than farrelli 's because the stadium seating view was much better . the menu had a lot of choices , mostly bar type food , but it was inexpensive and offered lots of options . we saw 21 jump street and had popcorn and drinks . the service was awesome ... very attentive and prompt . all in all , i can say we will be back again for sure . we had a great overall experience and would highly recommend it . in fact , we 've already purchased two more groupons , which i think it an awesome deal to say the least !		4		1
ca n't believe we have n't written a review yet for one of our favorite neighborhood spots . we 've been here so many times with various friends and family . the spot is cozy and comfortable ... nice little `` over the top '' tuscan design . friendly and prompt service when you sit down , and oh so yummy garlic bread is brought right away . you 'll be tempted to fill up , but do n't . for starters , we love the pear/proscuitto/burrata salad . not cheap but easy to share with several diners at the table . their caesar salad is fresh and full of garlicky lemony goodness . we have several favorite pastas -- the cannelloni , which is not smothered with bechamel , but has just the right amount ; the ravioli carbonara -- chicken and beef filled ravioli with an eggy , bacon cream sauce ; and the ravioli de zucca -- butternut squash ravioli with a crazy-good four-cheese sauce . we also love their wood-oven pizza . the crust has a great chew and it 's not overloaded with sauce . we particularly love the quattro stagioni -- mushrooms , artichokes , proscuitto and sausage ... we ask for it `` scattered '' so all pieces have all the goodies . we always end with the tiramisu because it is so good . it is not the cheapest italian restaurant around , but i 'd much rather spend more for great ambiance , made from scratch food and the best service around .		4		1
i came here tonight with my friend on one of our worldly eating adventures . i thought it was very good ! the place is n't super fancy inside or out , but the service was fine and attentive and the food was good . we shared the lamb vindaloo -lrb- spicy -rrb- and chicken tikka masala -lrb- medium -rrb- along with some rice and garlic naan . so first they brought out the indian equivalent of chips and salsa ... it was a crispy thing with a green , spicy sauce and a purple sweet and spicy sauce which were both good . then we got the food . well , i was not a huge fan of the lamb . i thought it was spicy , but did n't have the flavors i really enjoy in indian food . it was just kind of spicy and boring . the tikka masala was delicious , however . it was creamy and flavorful , with just a little spice . i would probably order it spicy next time . the naan was good , but nothing super special . when we were done , they brought out a little free dessert which was like a pancake puff ball soaked in syrup ... pretty good stuff . i thought the place was pretty pricy , but that 's kind of the way it goes with indian food . overall , i thought it was a good experience and i would definitely come back .		4		1
the habit burger is fast becoming a regular weekly stop for me . i truly enjoy the combo burger with swiss cheese and mushrooms . it is a great tasting burger through and through . the fries are also spectacular . i brought my six year old here last week and we tried the caesar salad which was surprisingly good . i am truly amazed that they can have a typical hamburger , fries and fast food menu alongside chicken , tri-steak , salads and other options . the selection is first rate and the prices are reasonable . the wait staff are friendly and courteous and truly want to assure their customers are satisfied . the reason i did not provide a five star rating is due to the size of the restaurant . the inside is small and it can be a maze to make it to the fixin bar to get a refill . the restaurant is normally at least three quarters filled and should be probably be expanded in some way . the parking can be a challenge . give it a try , you will not be disappointed .		4		1
yay ! i 'm a fan ! tried out turf last night for hh . . and even though i arrived exactly at 6pm when it was ending , i saw that the waitress still gave me $ 0.50 off my strongbow . i was actually surprised at how busy it was ! we were able to finagle some extra chairs for our table from the nice firemen next to us , but at one point throughout the 3 hour visit i had , the whole place was slammed ! i do n't think that they were expecting such a crowd , so the service was a bit slow until they had another waitress show up . she was probably at home watching sitcoms and pissed she had to come in on her day off , but whatever . i ended up selecting the garden burger , which was delicious and paired with waffle fries . i was really surprised that they had as many veggie options as they did . they also have a veggie boxty , grilled cheese , cheese quesedilla and a couple of salads ! i could not resist trying a slice of the whiskey cake . it was out of this world !!!!!! check the photos for a shot of it : -rrb- i swear , it will make your night !!! i will be back , especially since the roosevelt/central light rail stop is like 1/4 mile away !!!!!!!!		4		1
thrice i have visited beckett 's table , and thrice i have enjoyed it . the vibe is cool , modern , and mellow . the first time around , we went with a large group of friends . we got the grilled cheese appetizer to start , and then i ordered the chicken and dumplings . the appetizer was rich and delicious and i have ordered it every visit since . the chicken and dumplings , however , were underwhelming , which is probably why i had forgotten about them when i went the second time and ordered them again . the chicken and dumplings is the sole reason beckett 's does n't get a five stars from me . i mean , if the meal was n't good the first time , and then a year later they have n't improved it or removed it from the menu , then that 's your bad , beckett 's table . even the waiter tonight admitted to it being bland -lrb- although he said it in a much kinder way -rrb- . tonight , however , i remembered to stray from the plain , boring meal that had plagued me the two previous times , and ordered the short ribs instead . good golly , what a difference that little meal made ! it was absolutely delicious and could easily be pulled apart by my fork alone . the short ribs melted in my mouth along with the creamy mashed potatoes . seriously good . the service tonight was also right on par . our table of six never ran low on drinks , and our server was quite patient with all of the questions we had regarding the menu and specials . my mother-in-law enjoyed the experience tonight so much , that she asked to speak directly with the manager to tell her how wonderful the service and food was . beckett 's table , you 're lucky i waited so long to write this review - it would n't have been as glowing last time . but you have earned yourself a solid 4 , maybe even 4.5 , stars from this girl .		4		1
first of all , the wife and i do enjoy this place . the food is very good , if not great , and we never leave hungry . of course , we routinely order $ 100-150 in final tab price meal . i 've had the filet , perfectly cooked and good , but a bit salty . i 've also head the salmon , which is a bargain on the menu ... $ 18 yields you two relatively large strips of salmon over mixed vegetables , in a delicious butter sauce with lemon taste . i 've had the seafood platter twice as an appetizer my wife and i shared . also , the toper of chocolate moose is one of the best fancy deserts i 've ever had , anywhere . almost worth going just for that . please pay the $ 9 and be grateful it 's one of the better values on the menu ... perfect date desert . their fries are very filling ... duck fries our outstanding . we use restaurant dot com for $ 25 and $ 50 and $ 100 certificates . i 'm not sure i could spend $ 150 for a couple at this restaurant and feel good about it otherwise . but getting $ 75 off $ 150 in food allows for going crazy , and when we go nuts when we get these , especially for 80 % off , we have a good time and the reastaurant still comes out ahead . . just had dinner there last night with my 9 year old daughter ... special night out . i ordered the salmon , she the mozzerlla and tomato pizza for $ 12 , which was huge and could have fed two kids . but i would never bring a younger child here . no drinks , finished with the tower of mouse , which my daughter thought was the coolest thing she 'd ever seen , and $ 50 before coupon , $ 25 after . this is a terrific date night or special occasion place to dine , and the cool modern decor is an interesting compliment to the french cuisine .		4		1
clearly worth 4 stars ! one of the best sushi restaurants in the valley ! it 's better than ra but not better than sushi roku . the service was also excellent . the waitresses are beautiful but friendly and did n't give off that trite scottsdale `` i 'm too good to work here '' vibe . the prices were not cheap . if anyone pretends this is affordable sushi , they are lying or stupid . we had a party of 4 and spent $ 130 including drinks . we only ordered maki rolls too . that same meal at ra would have been less than a $ 100 . it 's not the most expensive sushi restaurant in the valley but it 's not `` affordable or inexpensive '' the only real knock on the place was it 's claustrophobic atmosphere . this place is terrible for big groups . it 's an ideal couples restaurant . we had 4 people and felt like our group was too big . there is n't much seating but they did their best to accomodate us . the restaurant is really narrow . i would recommend this restaurant but only for couples and for those willing to spend over $ 80 if you are going to eat and drink alcohol .		4		1
from the start i had a bit of a chip on my shoulder from the reservation making process . monday morning i find out that i need to make a reservation for 8 people for dinner that night , at 5:30 or 6 p.m. . so i quickly get on the phone with the keg who 's answering machine says they are closed but to leave a message and someone will get back to me . well 5 hours later no one had called me back yet , so i tried again , same thing , i pressed `` zero '' thinking maybe this would work , it did , i got someone in an office somehow . i explained to them what i needed and had been waiting for a phone call back for hours . he did n't seem very concerned , and took my information again , and said someone would call me back . great ! more waiting around . business dinner , kinda important people , cant wait around all day . so i wait , and the hostess calls me back about 15 minutes later . she had a bit of an attitude . she mad it seem like a hassle for us to want to be coming in for dinner . i was n't sure how quickly we would be able to get there and it might be closer to 6 than 5:30 , this was unacceptable to her , `` its going to have to be 5:30 '' again i explained we would be there as soon as we could . hello ! 8 people , business dinner , one check , minimum $ 40 a head , what is the problem ? you say great see you then and hang up , do n't give me shit ! i can just as easiyly take the group somewhere else . she told me that the servers would be standing around wondering where the table was and that is why we had to be there by 5:30 , no ! sorry we are not here to cater to the server , ugh ! sorry done ranting but it was very rude , and for the money we planned to spend i really do n't think i needed to deal with the spanish inquisition to make dinner reservations . whatever , long story short , we showed up when we did , sat down when we pleased , all was okay in the world . dinner was fantastic ! the server was a doll , helped to suggest a great wine , walked us through the menu perfectly . everything was essentially seamless . the timing was perfect ! this is probably one of the hardest things to get right in a place like this , and they nailed it . so all in all , even though the hostess gave me a hard time , we had a blast . thank you ! ps : get the mushrooms and garlic mashed , with whatever cut of meat you get , they are all good !		4		1
holy cow . i could be a hindu if only the method of worshipping was eating the object of worship . -lrb- which i guess makes my true natural religion vulvan , but that 's another story -rrb- ` ,8 ^ -rcb- the half priced , half kobe , half chuck , happy hour daily dose burger was wholly delicious . the pretzel-bread bun just took it over the top . the rest of the menu looked thoughtfully prepared , and a brief conversation with one of the principals confirmed the serious attitude with which they take their establishment . the staff handling our patio party was to be heartily commended . the server was actually remembering and calling most everyone at the table by their first name ! the empty plates and beer bottles never lingered long , and the cucumber slice infused -lrb- i 'll never enjoy lemon-water quite as much again , this stuff was so refreshing ! -rrb- water glasses were never empty . perhaps the wonderful company of multiple yelpers and the genuine conversation had me in a bit of an in-clover stupor , but i left daily dose with a feeling of fulfillment that went far beyond my belly . special thanks donald for the set-up , and carin 's parents for being so hip and cool !		4		1
anyone who asks , `` are you a vegan to lose weight ? '' should come to green and eat their words . and everything else . in fact , i usually end up at green with non-vegetarian friends because they claim that it 's `` food you can eat that i actually like . '' every dish is addictive , flavorful , saucy , and filling . classic hits include the chicken thai peanut bowl , the singapore tofu bowl -lrb- although the mock meats are a shame to miss out on -rrb- , the vegan bbq chicken sammich -lrb- i just watched a carnivorous friend down this with the delight and voracity of a young velociraptor -rrb- , and then there are the eternally awesome specials . even though you 'll probably be stuffed post-meal ... make room for dessert . it 's mind over matter anyway . order a tsoynami - they 're like mcflurries with vegan ice cream and epic swirl ins . standouts include tsoynamis filled with anything from frozen chocolate fudge , bananas , kitkats , hazlenut brittle , mint oreos and more . on a another note , this is also the only strictly vegan restaurant in the tempe/scottsdale area with a lively , hip atmosphere . even if you love steak more than anything in the world -lrb- and there are steak po ` boys , might i add -rrb- at least stop by for a chocolate chip cookie and check out the awesomeness of the place .		4		1
i have long been a fan of the market bistro location on thunderbird , so when i spotted the newer location on greenway yesterday , i had to stop in for a bite . i was pleasantly surprised to find that kid 's meals are free on saturdays ! and , mind you , this is no mickey-d 's trans-fat-laden meal ... my son had grilled pesto chicken , homemade mac & cheese and a big bowl of fruit salad -lrb- grapes , pears , strawberries and apples -rrb- . healthy , delicious and free ... ca n't beat it ! my meal was amazing . i love the pesto chicken sandwich , and should probably ask for an extra side of the corn mixture next time , because it is just so tasty . my caesar salad had chives and sun-dried tomatoes , alonf with their delicious parmesan crisps and croutons . the half-sandwich/salad meal was so large that i ended up taking half of the salad to go . two dinners for less than $ 10 - awesome ! even better than that ? the service . they must take pride in the employees that they hire , because all three girls that were working were incredibly helpful , and made the restaurant feel more full-service , than fast-casual . now , if only market bistro would open up a spot in midtown , i 'd be even happier . please ? pretty please ???		4		1
there are a few options on their menu that i love , so it takes grand lux from 3 stars to 4 . the bacon cheeseburger is unreal -lrb- they add lardon , which is like french bacon , and stupid delicious -rrb- , and i love the chicken and waffles on their weekend brunch menu . my wife likes the pot roast and the salmon picatta . if you like the cheesecake factory , you 'll think grand lux is pretty good . overall , i 'd rather go to cheesecake factory -lrb- if not for the desserts alone -rrb- , because i feel like their entire menu is stronger . lux does offer baked to order desserts , which are very good . their lava cake and beignets are both baked to order and delicious . the interior is spacious , and it 's so big that there 's rarely a wait , which is a plus . there is bar seating , dining room seating and patio seating , so you 've got your choice of ambiance . service is always good , which makes a huge difference in my book . i like the convenience of grand lux a lot . it 's at the mall , so it 's a really good option when you 're out shopping . if you 're looking for a large , diverse menu and a good option while you 're at the mall , i 'd definitely recommend grand lux , especially if you love a good burger .		4		1
is liberty market my favorite place to eat ? no , but it is unique , sits in downtown gilbert and just has that `` likeability '' quality . their food choices are classic -lrb- sandwiches , salads , pizzas -rrb- and for the most part , tasty . i like the ambience inside , everything is wide open and welcoming . staff is friendly and prices are reasonable . i guess i just ca n't say i love anything i 've tried here . the margherita pizza to me does n't really resemble a margherita pizza . there are n't slices of tomato , basil and mozzarella on top but sliced really thin and almost could pass a cheese pizza without the small strips of basil on top . i also recently ventured to try a dessert , which was highly recommended by the cashier , and i really hated it . i do n't remember the name of it but it was essentially a brownie/cookie made with corn flakes . it was overly sweet and had a very odd texture . no go for me ! i recall breakfast choices being better and might go again soon to recall my distant memory .		4		1
i was lucky enough to visit cafe monarch about 2 months ago for a friend 's birthday , and i ca n't wait to go back ! tracy 's review was right on the money when she described this place as being invited to your friend 's house for a home cooked meal . -lrb- if your friend was a fantastic chef and host ! -rrb- do n't forget to bring a nice bottle of wine to share , as this place is strictly byob . chris , while busy , was a fantastic host/chef and catered to our every need . -lrb- even tossing out our corking fee - thx chris ! -rrb- be sure to make reservations well in advance , it fills up quick because the place is the size of your living room , but it is well worth any wait you may have . be warned though , going here is an all nite event - do not make plans for anything later in the evening ! -lrb- and if you do , you will be prepared to cancel them all at first bite - it 's that good ! -rrb- overall , this place is simply gnat-tastic ! * wink * enjoy !		4		1
i 've been to copper star since it first opened , pre-yelp days for me and my locavore ways were still being established but eversince my first copper star experience i 've been in love with this coffeehouse . i just love their place , the former gas station turned coffeehouse makes this place as one of the places i bring out of town guests to show them that phoenix does have its little gems and 7th ave or `` melrose '' is just quaint . anywho , i 've had good chai here , and yummy creamy nonfat vanilla lattes but only recently did i try a pastry treat . the lady behind the counter was a sweetheart and she made me feel extra special when she liked my `` human '' shirt and asked who designed it ... yes that day i was proud to be a gay black woman ... as my shirt starts off with . i bought myself the nonfat vanilla latte with carrot cake cupcake that had what seemed was an extra dollop of cream cheese frosting , delish ! it was truly carrotrific , and the cupcake provided a great sweetness kick to go with my extra caffeinated beverage . copper star may not be a lux with it 's urban chic interior , or the real bohemian interior of lola on roosevelt or the hipster cool of cartel in tempe , no , copper star is simply cool with its venue and hold its own with its great drinks , coffees and treats , so hence copper star is truly a coffeehouse star !		4		1
attended a networking luncheon here . if you 've never been here before , the drive up to the restaurant is a bit confusing . the directional signs to guide you to your destination are non-existent . however , once you reach your destination , you 're in for a real treat . the restaurant is perched on top of a ridge that overlooks part of the phoenix valley . the view is spectacular ! the food is great too . there was passed hors d'oeuvres at the beginning of the event that were very tasty . then just before the main speaker began , we were all seated for lunch . we were served a petite filet and some veggies with a light citrus salad as an appetizer . both were very good . the servers were great . they kept our water and iced tea glasses full throughout the lunch and promptly took away our dishes after each course . for dessert , we had cheesecake topped with berries ... it was delish ! overall , it was a very good luncheon . if they hold one here again , i will definitely attend . i will also come back for a dinner with the better half . return factor - 88 %		4		1
i always make a point to inquire as to what people do for christmas dinner . this is easily mistaken as an interest in learning and understanding other cultures , when in reality i 'm just looking for a scapegoat . just once , when someone screams `` you eat chef boyardee for christmas !? '' at me , i 'd like to be able to say `` oh yeah ... well -lsb- insert your name -rsb- eats -lsb- insert something like but not necessarily puppy tails and applesauce -rsb- ! '' for like , a long time , my family have made hand-made ravioli for christmas . it 's a long and laborious process that takes up the better part of a sunday afternoon . so naturally that 's when i decided to pick up a gift certificate for someone from tammie coe . we 're almost knuckle deep in flour and grated cheese when i call to see when they close . the ravioli was going to take us 2-3 hours to finish . and guess how much longer tammie coe was open ? that 's right , 2-3 hours . the smell of dough still fresh on my threads , misty s and i jetted -lrb- or should i say `` jetta 'd '' ... fuck you -rrb- to central phoenix to pick up the gift certificate before the dogs realized they preferred raw dough to dog food . now , i had been to tammie coe quite a few times , usually in tow with amanda b . since layers of delicious frosting tend to clash with layers of expensive makeup , i usually opt out of eating any of their tasty treats . i simply sip on a peach tea and pretend i 'm not starving for some fucking cake . but there we were , on a sunday morning , dressed in our pajamas , having missed breakfast and looking forward to three hours of pasta-making . misty s said looking at all the food made her hungry . well , yeah . saying that tammie coe does n't make you hungry is like saying bandaids does n't bring you deep , deep shame . so along with the gift certificate we got two chicken salad sliders , a peach tea , iced chai , and one of those giant chocolate chip cookies i like to call `` diabetes frisbees '' . the sliders were all kinds of delicious . even my veg-leaning squeeze thought so . and considering the prices at other places in the area , you 're not going to beat a $ 2 sandwich . unless you rob the place . would a yelp review count as evidence in court ? `` your honor , i present to you exhibit y , where the defendant writes ` and as i walked out of the restaurant , money in hand , the cowering hostess muttered to me ` thank you for coming , have a nice day ' . three stars for outstanding hospitality . '' the peach tea was , as expected , great . i almost wish someone would find a way to fuck up peach tea so i could judge how good all this tea i 've been drinking really is . the few sips i had of misty 's iced chai latte were above and beyond starbucks quality . but then again , what is n't ?		4		1
this tends to be my main vein for my movie fix . they have an awesome collection of foreign and classic films that has yet to be matched anywhere in phoenix . if you 're looking for a foreign title that 's in the criterion collection , chances are that you 'll find it here . the great thing about this place too is that you get to rent up to five movies without having to return them for something like five weeks and you could probably spend your whole life doing this once a month and never get through all the films they have . another reason i love this library is the architecture . it makes great use of the space and does n't feel like an academic library . one random thing however is the odd borg cube-like sculpture that looks like it crashed in the main entrance . overall , it 's just an awesome building to be in and experience . burton barr is a really peaceful place if you need somewhere to study . there 's an awesome view from the top story where you can get a great view of central and downtown . my only complaint ? it smells like homeless people in some spots . that sounded cruel , but you know what i mean .		4		1
`` he is 175 yards from the hole , i think he will use a 6 iron '' waaaaaccck ... `` it 's in the hole , it 's in the hole ! '' yeah , yeah , golf is not my bag , but pubs and drinking are ! now this pub was recently remodeled according to my newly found tourer de force friend . now i say this because he seemed to have a lot of knowledge of the non-douche areas of scottsdale , and surprisingly there are a lot of nooks and crannies in scottsdale that lack douche-ness . so going here with a 4 some , 2 guys and 2 gals , was a good pairing , i can drive the ball , my date can putt , if i get stuck in a sand trap , she just happens to have a `` sand wedge '' in her back pocket . the key to this place is going with the right people . it is set up to encourage talking , and not tv watching , or staring at the crowd . so pick your party of players carefully , and bring an extra bag of naked lady tees , you 'll need them . overall this place is very cool , and chill . speaking of chill they had 2 girls handing out miller lite chill beer for free . i am not sure this is the chill crowd , but they had lime green dresses on , low cut , and skimpy , so i am sure they made some chill friends . the best thing about this place is the discreteness , it 's located in a somewhat boring plaza , where everything seems to be named simply for what they sell `` sub shop '' `` pizza '' , or `` korean restaurant '' the outside of the bop , does n't do the interior justice . it feels very pub friendly , warm , and cozy . it 's a perfect place for a pint or four and conversation . also , the remodeling was done in early 90 's pub decor with a splash of 70 's retro , so do n't be afraid it 's sold out . just go check it out and enjoy . when you 're done feel free to peruse the shops of papago plaza , checkout `` just shoes '' , or `` liquor store , or even `` haircuts '' it will give you something else to yelp about .		4		1
mrs. whites makes genuinely good food that you ca n't pass up ! if you live in phoenix and have never tried it , you 're doing yourself a disservice . these guys are best known for their fried chicken , and for good reason ! it is always fresh and super crisp on the outside but nice and juicy on the inside . it is cooked to absolute perfection . it is handily some of the better fried chicken i have ever had . i wish the batter they used for the coating had a bit more seasoning or spices since i like my chicken with a bit of a kick , but they have plenty of louisiana hot sauce to dump all over it if that 's your thing -lrb- it 's often mine -rrb- . chicken is n't all they do , however , and if you 're just not in the mood for fried chicken , they have plenty of other southern staples to satisfy your appetite , including fish and pork chops . they also have solid homestyle sides and very yummy cornbread . on the weekends they make a knockout okra gumbo that is to die for . the place itself is a dump , but that is actually a good thing in this case -lrb- at least to me -rrb- . it has tons of character and charm and it really feels like it has a history ! one tip : do n't bother unless you 're hungry . the portions are huge . really huge . i 've never left here without a distended stomach ... it 's not the cheapest place to eat in the valley -lrb- plan on nearly $ 20 for a lunch with tip -rrb- , but the food is generally worth it , and if you 're hungry enough to eat it all , it 's a decent value .		4		1
first , just be careful of sitting on the planters on the north side of the building if you have to wait for a table ... sometimes you might get surprised by ants ... now , if that did n't scare you away -lrb- and i was trying a little , because i am hoping to tamp down the wait time a scoche -rrb- please enjoy yourself ! postino 's arcadia location is the original forerunner in the revitalization of the phoenix scene . postino . cleverly located in a former post office . thanks usps . if you find yourself here with a wait -lrb- not always , but sometimes -rrb- look about yourself . the patrons at this location are uber friendly . with a larger-than-average number of regulars , some of them have very good stories to share , and are particularly generous . we waited one night and had two gentlemen with a high top table offer to let us share their space . it was a rousing good time full of mutual ease , and they left before our party of 3 had finished . when we went to pay , we found out they had taken care of the entire bill . thanks guys ! it 's that kinda place . a little magical , a little homey , a little bit of wonderful with great food and plentiful draughts , and just enough contemporary edge that you can impress a date , or drink with the dudes .		4		1
i give this guy credit . it takes guts to open a burger joint in a town with a bajillion other ones . they all try to stand out from one another which is the one thing that makes them all similar to me . applying some type of schtick to over-priced meat is not all it takes to win my patronage . anyway ... my wife and i went here for dinner on friday night . it was about 7pm and the place was pretty dead which was nice . it was us , a few workers and 2-3 other diners . i did n't think so by looking at the place , but it really is a neighborhood joint . everybody seemed to know each other and there was friendly banter between some of the diners and owner/workers . i got a real nice friendly neighborhood vibe from the place . the food ... * ceasar salad - very good - a bit too much dressing but that 's the way i like it * burger brulee - interesting and pretty good - i give them credit for trying something different , but it really was n't my thing . the burnt sugar on the bun gave it a crunchy texture but having a sweetness to a burger is weird to me . * beach house burger - this was a good burger . i originally wanted to order this but my wife said she was getting it so i had to order a different one . from the bite that she gave me i could tell that it was very good . all the ingredients seemed to work together on this one . * sweet potato tots - these were excellent . the only thing that would have made them better is some type of aioli . * seasoned fries - very good - they were perfectly cooked and seasoned . the people here are what really stand out in my mind about this place . the owner and all the other workers were very friendly and passionate about their restaurant . i ca n't wait to return to try about 17 other things on their menu that look good .		4		1
frasher 's -lrb- pronounced fraisier 's -rrb- is a great place to hang out -- though it 's not your typical scottsdale destination . the owners have an interesting taste in decor -lrb- interesting = questionable . note the leather couch on the patio . -rrb- but , i like it , so it 's ok with me . happy hour ? excellent . half price on already cheap appetizers and good pours on the drinks . the bartenders ? i want to miniaturize them , put them in my pocket and carry them around with me everywhere . even the ` grouchy ' one makes me peal in laughter . the food ? it 's st. louis themed , plenty of meat , the salmon is smoked on premises and is delicious , in fact , everything i 've had is excellent . if you 're from st. louis , and you 're jonesing for pizza topped with all of that signature cheese , drop everything and head over . i 've heard this is one of the few places you can find it . i 'm always surprised at the variety of people here and how little i 've spent during happy hour when i walk out the door . dinner can be a little pricey , but you can order anything off the menu at the bar so it might be a good place to start .		4		1
i did it , i broke my solemn vow ... i braved the self-absorbed yuppies and the tanned and coiffed mommies in $ 100 lulu lemon yoga pants who 've never broken a genuine sweat in their lives -lrb- bikram yoga does n't count , bitches ! -rrb- and i went into whole foods with my husband and toddler . previously i 'd publically vowed that i would n't be caught dead in there . well , curiosity got the best of me and not surprisingly it was packed elbow to elbow with other curious shoppers . but oh my glob , it was dazzling !! i was drawn in by the siren song of a bakery case filled with desserts too pretty to eat and prices high enough to deter you if you decided they were pretty enough to eat after all , and a salad and prepared foods section too varied and ginormous to describe , and a seafood and meats section across one wall , beckoning us with thick cut bacon , and exotic fishes and beautiful , marbled cuts of meat . and the cheese section ? the mind boggles . it was all too much ! i 'm not exactly a bona fide gourmand so when the very helpful employee behind the seafood counter cheerfully offered me a free sample of the prepared seaweed salad i politely accepted it and took a tiny bite , immediately regretting it and wishing there was a discreet trash can where i could spit the green , slimy , masticated glob of seaweed out of my mouth . i gritted my teeth and swallowed . -lrb- and yes , in case you were wondering , it was exactly like that kind of a swallow . -rrb- finally , i spied a package of vanilla , small bakery made whoopie pies over in the bakery area . unhealthy , fattening and uniquely american : it speaks my language ! in addition to the whoopie pies we also picked up some french cookies from the bakery , two small boxes of pasta salads from the salad/cold food bar , and a bottle of house wine on special ; a sour and dry moscato , that tasted nothing like any moscato i 've ever had and i hated it , immensely . our total bill was about $ 50 for the 5 items , and we carried out our lone , little grocery bag with $ 50 worth of groceries to our car . looking around the parking lot it appeared that we really were out of our element sporting a pro-life bumper sticker on one side of the back window , and the thrash rivet band ; ministry bumper sticker on the other side , in a sea of prius ' with obama '12 bumper stickers , and subarus with world wildlife foundation stickers and ski racks . clearly , we are not their signature clientele . would i go back ? probably . this is definitely the place to get that hard to come by ingredient for a special recipe . but i 'd only venture back with a bigger wad of money and healthy dose of cynicism for the image whole food 's target demographic puts off about their ` healthy ' lifestyle in mind , body and spirit . * snorts heartily * oh and remember those whoopie pies i bought at this veritable mecca of health food ??? they ended up being the most unhealthy , butter dripping , sugary deliciousness i 've eaten since i was a carefree little kid with a stomach of iron . in fact they were so disgustingly delicious that i could only tolerate a sliced off quarter of one per day , otherwise i literally felt queasy . bravo , whole foods , it appears we are not so dissimilar after all !		4		1
awesome english muffins . baked fresh , often . they are a bit pricey , but huge - big enough to hold a decent sized hamburger and all the trimmings , or maybe a couple of poached eggs , canadian bacon and rich hollandaise sauce-mmmmm . the lgo grocery is a great little neighborhood hangout , perfect for a morning walk to grab some tea and a commuter - one of the greatest egg sandwiches ever devised . this grocery serves ala carte breakfast , lunch and dinner and carries an extensive selection of wines . you can also find kitschy little knick-knacks like pizza cutters that look like circular saws , or books with witty phrases and folk philosophy . old-style packaged candies , sodas , beers , all the usual trimmings of a convenience store , but elevated to a higher plane . this is a great place to grab a quick breakfast , shake out the newspaper and read . or people - watch , or just chill on a warm saturday morning .		4		1
this place has some of the best happy hour offers ive seen in a while . $ 5 burgers / specialty martinis , and half off apps on tues ? yes please . about half their taps had been pulled when we went , but they did have a good selection left . i went for the tickled pink martini though , which was delicious . as a table , we started w / the popcorn w / truffle butter . sooooo delicious . i may be tempted to get some of it to go the next time i go to the tmp harkins to see a flick . my friends throughly enjoyed their meals : the chicago stockyard burger , mac & cheese w / bacon , shrimp po ` boy , and regular burger . my husband was very happy that he could get a side of -lrb- or sub his fries for -rrb- the mac and cheese . i however wasnt too impressed w / my meal . i had the turkey , ham , and brie w / tots . it was supposed to come w / dijon mustard and blackberry jam on it ... 90 % mustard . i couldnt even taste the jam . part of the reason i ordered it was that it sounded like an interesting combo . it was also kind of an awkward sandwich to eat being that the parmesan bread it was on was just a french roll turned upside down w / parmesan cheese melted on whats usually the inside . my tots tasted like they werent fully cooked too . lastly , our bartender was kind of dense -lrb- we sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of our group to get a table -rrb- , but our server was awesome . i also really like what they did w / the space formerly known as darcy magees . it seemed way more inviting and much bigger than dm . ill go back , but ill be ordering a different meal .		4		1
3.75 do not park where a sign tells you not to park !! you will be towed !! there are spots in the parking lot with signs that say something like `` military personnel parking only '' or some crap like that . if you park there , you will lose your car . it does n't matter what time it is . tow trucks come in with their lights off & tow tons of cars away . can you imagine going to enjoy a show , coming out , & your car is gone ?!?!?! the first time i ever came here the door guy would n't let me bring my unopened bottle of water in . i take issue with places in phoenix that do n't let you bring water in . do n't you know what dehydration is ?! i 'm over 21 , but i still have a vertical id . i got my wrist band no problem . it 's pretty quiet between bands . i think i heard music once . it gets hot ! they only run the a/c when the bands are n't playing . wtf is this nonsense ?! run it when they are playing ; that 's when everyone is moving & hot . sound can suck here . you can barely hear or understand the singers sometimes . the sound guy totally made the drums drown out the lead during 1 band . but then again , 1 band was great when it came to sound . they took time to make sure everyone was balanced . i did n't even bother going into the caution taped off bar area . but it 's a pretty big section of the venue . i 'm 1 of those people way up close rocking out . it 's great up there , even if i do have to tell the 5 foot 13 year old next to me to stop shoving for no reason or she 's gon na get an elbow to the face . hey , it 's good to learn venue etiquette early , right ? yeah , for some reason i kind of like the clubhouse . hmm must be because i can pay $ 10-15 to have a great night ...		4		1
almost a five star bar but i 'm a beer snob , but more on that in a bit . there is something to be said about a good bar -lrb- haha , get it ? goodbar -rrb- . the kind if place where you can toss back some cold ones with people that are fun . the conversationalist . the cute girl who is bubbly and has something interesting to say . your wingman . and of course , if she 's in town , your best friend lady . the rose and crown is the place where you should hang out with all of them . i popped in here to get myself a little sauces up before the yelp eats uye , which was next door at nobuo . immediately , the absolutely adorable bartender kim , came up and promptly took my drink order and made me feel welcome . i 'd probably have made more conversation with her but other patrons showed up . sounds like this is an interesting place . it 's similar to nobuo in that it 's a historic house and laid out as such . a little musty , but quaint , yet awesome . very english . you 'll see images of benny hill and james bond . this place is badass like that . ok , the beer was slightly piss warm and flat . something was clearly wrong with the draft line . i know a little something or two about the mechanics of it because fun fact ... i 've built a draft system before . i do n't mind . i 'll stick to hard liquor next time . i loved the vibe so much . this is the perfect place to get hosed .		4		1
i love this place . when i lived over here i would go here constantly , like every week . it 's very small and the service is n't the fastest , but the people barely speak english , so i 'm not complaining too much . it 's definitely a legit vietnamese place . the menu is huge ! my favorite item is the rolls . they bring out a forest of garnishes - mint leaves , bean sprouts , carrots , etc. . i always get the spicy pork . it 's got nuts and chili flakes on it . yum ! they bring out the moist rice paper and away you go ! the absolute best part is their peanut sauce . it 's to die for . i asked for the recipe once and the little old lady -lrb- the owner -rrb- just laughed and shook her head and said , `` haha no no ... no . '' she reminded me of superman 's hispanic maid on family guy . only con is their awful bathroom set up where you have to wait until the cooks are ready for you to walk back there . kind of annoying . and they also ca n't accept credit cards for less than a $ 10 charge .		4		1
comfortable . refined . inventive . consistent . one-star deduction for no vegetarian entree . the tuck shop is such a welcome arrival in our coronado neighborhood . i like stopping there on my bike for a beer after work ; or taking friends and sitting in the reading room for cocktails ; or having an intimate dinner ; or taking in the sounds of local bands at the coronado home tour . much has been said about the architect-hip decor , and i feel right at home here . i 'll skip to the food . for vegetarians , there are a few stand-by dishes , all small plates or salads , listed here in my order of delectability -lrb- # 1 is the best -rrb- : 1 . roasted baby beets in spiced mustard creme -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- 2 . baby lettuce , avocado salad , fennel , blood orange -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- 3 . panini bites ; grilled pear , arugula , taleggio , honey -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- 4 . patatas bravas , spicy tomato sauce , aoili -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- 5 . grilled baguette , creamy roasted garlic with olive oil -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- 6 . panko-walnut crusted fontina , savory and sweet dipping sauces -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- sometimes i return just for the beets , which i absolutely can not reproduce at home . suggestion : it would be nice to have a vegetarian main dish option , and i hope tuck shop responds soon . cocktails in the reading room replete with old-school games -lrb- labyrinth ! -rrb- , colored pencils , architecture books , etc. , make waiting easy . and sometimes i just eat in the reading room itself . since they make their own mixers -lrb- ginger ale , tonic , lemonade -rrb- and serve tito 's -lrb- texas -rrb- vodka , no hangover and no sickeningly sweet afterburn . service here is on-point , especially with the acute attention to detail of the manager , john . he always makes sure to come say hello . now , i have had some errant pours brought to my table . my vodka-ginger ale came as a vodka-lemonade , and then my vodka ginger ale came as a gin & tonic . john offered to remake the drinks without a problem . i am impressed with tuck shop in its nascent stage . add a vegetarian main , and i 'll add a star !		4		1
so this place is pretty darn heavy on my rotation . i 've come here in big groups , small groups , by myself - and this place never disappoints . it does get crowded so i try to usually come here after 1pm when the crowd dies down a bit . this is yet another place where i constantly run into groups of people from my workplace . heck we might as well just hold all our meetings here . maybe the attendance would improve . parking is never a problem as it 's part of a big mall . service is always pretty good even if the place is packed . probably because this place has so many regulars . i know folks that come here more than once a week . i usually go for the lunch special - posted right at the entrance . the lunch menu is not that big so the specials are often the thing to try . if not for the specials i go for the red curry . nice and spicy . oh yeah . you start out with a salad buffet with peanut sauce dressing . you can also get soup with that . very reasonably priced for all you get .		4		1
i 'm a sucker for breakfast places so i 've been meaning to try over easy for a long time . i finally went there this sunday morning . although the place was packed , the wait was relatively short -lrb- ~ 10 mins -rrb- . they sat us in a corner of the restaurant behind some sort of partition . as my friend put it , `` it 's like sitting at the kids ' table . '' our area , with 4 tables , is sort of separated from the rest of the restaurant . although a little strange , at least it was quieter . they pack so many tables in the room that i think it may be a fire hazard . either way , i ignored the thought of a flaming death and went on to enjoy my food . the waffle dogs are actually very good . it 's not greasy at all . the batter had good flavor and the sausage was not too salty or greasy . the sauce brought just the right amount of sweetness . overall , a very balanced dish . my friend 's caramelized banana french toast looked awesome , while my corned beef hash with eggs was also very nicely done . i would probably prefer a little more corned beef and a little less potato in the dish though . overall , i will be back for more breakfast goodness .		4		1
this year -lrb- 2013 -rrb- marks the 25th year for the festival . i 've been a handful of times over the years . i do n't necessarily like it , but i have respect for it . years before larping was a thing and way before cosplay was cool and mainstream , these dedicated medieval nerds , actors , and craftsmen have been putting down their 12-sided dies and crawling out of their parent 's basements to create a fun , diy handcrafted fantasy world piece by piece . every year it gets bigger and more detailed . they still manage to avoid corporate sponsorship and the price really has n't climbed out of control since they started either . many booths now have websites as well so you can also buy their goods online , and a few are even starting to get square so you can pay by credit card . for years , this was a cash-only affair -lrb- and for the most part it still is -rrb- . taxes ? well , their plates and cups are closely inventoried now to help keep track of that and to keep them honest , but i get the feeling that a lot of this still flies under the radar . you can still get your steak on a stake , giant fried fish , salted pretzels and bread bowls . the food here is actually pretty good . it 's one consistent thing about this : always something good to eat . you 'll see people walking around chomping on giant turkey legs and there 's a place here that makes some of the best crepes i 've ever had . there are a few artisan chocolate makers here as well . over the years , the use of `` huzzah ! '' has declined dramatically . you do n't seem to hear it as often . it was always pretty much the iconic catchphrase of the fair . this weekend , i think i was the only person who said it -lrb- even though i was saying it ironically , since i was the only asshole saying it , i was the problem -rrb- . my lovely older sister has been into this since damn near the beginning . she has been attending mostly as a performer , and has met many of her closest friends through the event . i never had the appreciation for this that she did . she used to sing opera , so she loved making and wearing costumes and period dresses . this was a perfect fit for her . she still loves it to this day , and i 'm sure every year she goes to at least one renaissance festival somewhere if not in az . . i 've only been a handful of times over the years , and i ca n't remember it ever being my idea to go . still - i do n't totally hate it or have a bad time . half the shops here sell things you would only buy to wear or bring the next time you come . the rest sell mostly impractical artisan crafts and trinkets . there are some sky chairs for the patio and some normal things you can buy , but not a lot . any pair of shoes you buy here will not be something you could wear outside of a costume party . if you are into roleplaying , then definitely come here . the shows they put on are funny and entertaining . the performers are good at what they do , and they have a fantastic time doing it . they also never seem to lose steam or energy . if you come to this fair in a bad mood , someone will be following you around trying to cheer you up or make fun of you . also - even though they hold this in february and march , it 's too hot out there . bring sunscreen . you 'll see people walking around wearing long black leather trench coats with heavy chain-mail armor and swords and crap and wonder how they are n't dropping dead from the heat . the reason is because half the people you see are from apache junction and you do n't understand just how acclimated they are to swamp cooler weather and living with swamp ass . the question arises - is this good for kids ? the answer is `` sort of '' - i mean , there is face painting , and kiddie rides that look barely safe , and plenty of entertainment that kids would enjoy , but then the shows can be raunchy , some of the attractions contain scenes of torture and most of what goes on here promotes violence . also , half the girls walk around in period costume with their boobs pushed up and almost bursting out . honestly , i do n't really give a shit what your kids are exposed to - but if you are really uptight about it , then do n't come here . also , the ground is all gravel , so if you bring a stroller here , you 're an idiot . it 's a huge place too , so your little kid will get bored quick and also tired of walking around . take them straight over to the petting zoo so they can pet some filthy goats and dogs and then come home with ringworm . the bottom line is - if you 've never done this , you really should . it 's a top notch event . it 's like a time-traveling low-budget circus with food and entertainment and a bunch of hand-made crap that you can buy . at least go and figure out that it 's not your thing . they serve alcohol here too , so you can get drunk and belligerent and everyone will just think you 're acting . you can wear street clothes or dress up . i 'm sure it 's more fun if you like to pretend and play dress up . worst part is getting there and parking .		4		1
so the tapicoa was `` so-so-ca '' -- not as crackity as i 'd expected from the employee 's near-orgasmic recommendation , but it was pretty good . everything we bought from fresh & easy was right on . the chipotle ranch salad dressing was particularly piquant and tasty ! i have to admit i was actually kind of wigged out that there no preservatives in things . i was worried that if we did n't cook & eat everything we bought from f & e within a 48 hour time period that it would spoil upon sight or exposure to sunlight -lrb- like a vampire -rrb- ... but that did n't happen . i think i just have ptf & vd -lrb- post traumatic fruits & vegetables disorder -rrb- . i tend to see fruits & veggies in the market and think , `` mmmm ... fresh beets ! i can make that ! '' and then the damned things sit on my counter and suffer a slow , rotten death before i finally just pitch them into the trash . i think i have baby carrots in my fridge from december . yikes . but i digress ... f & e was great . not sure that we 'll shop there on a regular basis -lrb- the selection was kinda limited and i 'm not by any means an agro-organo-health zealot , and frankly i 'm not very ecologically sound at all -lrb- see my posts on cheap cigs & booze -rrb- ... but it is nearby and convenient and what we did buy & consume tasted great . maybe if i 'd quit smoking i 'd truly `` taste the freshness '' ...		4		1
this place is definitely a classic . i only wish i had gone there more growing up in the area . if i wanted to , i could catch up now though , because nothing has changed about this place ! cheap , tasty grub . three video games at the front . bumper stickers and photos all over the place , and of course , the young high school -lrb- or recent graduate -rrb- girls working there . i think the only difference from the ol' days is that they have some sort of atm type system . i tried something new this time , going with the bbq brisket sandwich with cheese . while the cheese was n't quite melted all the way , i definitely enjoyed the sandwich . the beef was flavorful and the bread seemed quite fresh . i washed it down with a classic , the cap'n cooler . i also liked that the food was brought to the table , that was a nice touch . if only they could make the parking lot a little more efficient ... four stars for the good grub and solid value .		4		1
yay !!!!!!!!!!! after months of anticipation , the new vig location -lrb- closer to me vs. what is now affectionately referred to as `` the vintage vig '' -rrb- is open and did not disappoint ! whew ! the parking seems to still have some kinks to work out , as any signs of a valet stand or staff were mia when i initially pulled up -lrb- 7pm on a sunday -rrb- . we figured it out though and no big deal . the atmosphere here is just awesome , i absolutely love it . it seems more spacious than the original space , but it was also slow while i was in there so i am hesitant to make a firm judgement until after it passes the friday-happy-hour-test . same great vibe though , perhaps even warmer/sexier atmosphere . the biggest surprise to me was the faux patio , with large open windows but actually an enclosed space . for me , one of the fatal flaws of the original vig patio the limited outdoor seats that also were n't smoking tables , so perhaps this is a good solve ? overall , will absolutely put this spot in heavy rotation . keep the new locations coming , please !!		4		1
i have come here several times since it is so close to my house . during restaurant week , we decided to invite some friends to experience this place . this year it was $ 40 per person which is ok for the location . we had not been here in a while . the location is pretty nice and if the day is beautiful , you can enjoy dinner in their beautiful patio . to start i had the beet salad and my hubby had the crab cakes , those were delicious , i wish i had chosen that . i love beets , but my salad was not as great as i have had before . for our entree i had the salmon and the hubby had the filet , those two dishes were amazing . on the other hand , the desserts were underwhelming . i prefer the dessert from the regular menu , specially the sticky caramel meringue terrine , yum . if you go for lunch or dinner , the hamburgers and salads are huge . an how can i forget my guilty pleasure , the bread basket has little corn bread muffins , those are the bomb , i could eat a dozen . no wonder my pants are a little tighter now .		4		1
had been meaning to get here and finally made it last night . excellent fare and solid service at reasonable prices . party of 6 of us - man i love summer when the tourists leave and you can get seated right away anywhere . so nice to have craft beer on tap with my mexican food - four peak hop knot ipa . started with the chips and guac which i thought was very good , although i would have preferred it with the cheese on top . the elote , on the other hand , was wonderful -- as good as i 've had . i ordered the `` paella '' , which was a ittle thicker than a standard paella and seafood-less , i believe -lrb- chicken , sausage , ham , root veggies -rrb- . very nice , and although i had plans to save some for tomorrow , it did n't happen . wifey said the chicken mole was good , but she still prefers the version at pepe 's taco villa . ok , to each her own . split an order of the coconut pudding -lrb- meh -rrb- , and a key lime pie/tart/square / something that was phenomenal -- creamy and super-tart . only downside was that it was pretty warm in there . do n't know if they had a/c problems or were using a swamp cooler , but it was borderline uncomfortable at times . crank up the a/c guys . great place . great location . i 'll be back to try the al pastor tacos , and ca n't wait to try the chicken soup everyone seems to be raving about ...		4		1
as i 'm leaving work this afternoon i say , `` shit '' when i remember have to buy dog food on my way home . been putting it off for a few days now , but when i fed her this morning , that was it , last cup . so my curious co-worker says , `` what ? '' so i tell her , `` got ta go to costco . '' and she says , `` why shit ? that 's fun . '' and i realize , my co-worker is as wise as she is curious . because it is fun . i love going to costco . where else can you buy cans of peanut butter that are larger than your head , twelve-packs of relish and blocks of cheese that will you last you the rest of your life ? you ca n't beat the prices or the ever changing selection . but the best part ? the samples -lrb- weekends , mostly -rrb- . some saturdays , that 's my lunch - walking from free sample station to free sample station . they 've got all kinds of stuff : cookies , crackers , vitamin water , energy bars , you name it . enough to fill you up , fo ' shizzle ! hey - i finally worked `` fo ' shizzle '' into one of my reviews . sweet .		4		1
this wo n't be the kind of zoo that will win international awards -lrb- although in cases with things like ` zoos ' , there 's always an award from some society to hand out -rrb- , but its a great way to spend a long morning and early afternoon with students . in this particular case , as chaperon for part of my gf 's 2nd grade class . something about ushering a group of five hyped up 7-year-olds through the chalky landscape , bomb-pops in hand , loaded up to their d-backs caps in sugar and expectations can make any place special . for these kids , the phoenix zoo delivered , and in turn delivered on my cautious optimism as well . a saccharine start in the `` tropics trail '' with a very smooth finish at the tigers , left every single one of my kids-for-the-day overenthused and buzzing . the highlight was their interactive venture into the sting ray pool , where for $ 3 -lrb- trying to remember -rrb- they got to dip their hands into the water and `` play '' with the rays . this made them literally goofy . i was also surprised that their food court was fairly extensive and the quality of food far exceeded my expectations . i had a bbq burger -lrb- comes with an onion ring on top -rrb- that was actually top-tier fast food . i remember it being modestly priced too -lrb- in terms of the typical amusement park racket -rrb- . overall , i was highly impressed with the phoenix zoo . as others have mentioned , the san diego zoo is the highest standard deviation from the mean as far as zoos are concerned , but i can certainly call the phoenix zoo a benchmark on which to build .		4		1
we discovered this place thanks to groupon . i bought 3 groupons and then i kept seeing this pop up and i kept buying more ... so , we 've been here quite a bit over the past year . we love this place because the food is good , servers are friendly , and when the weather is nice the outdoor patio is a perfect place to enjoy a meal . here are some highlights of what we 've tried : caprese salad , $ 8.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=7x7hxjlqu8xuyeqpzu4ghg#7x7hxjlqu8xuyeqpzu4ghg bruschetta , $ 9.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=28td0bosui3rhwzmlg9v2a#28td0bosui3rhwzmlg9v2a http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=90sep0sxi4_0q7shgsjczq#90sep0sxi4_0q7shgsjczq http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=s6culpdizfnw5gbx9crwjg#s6culpdizfnw5gbx9crwjg grilled halibut , $ 21.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=75em7plz3pejl9p2i-gnaa#75em7plz3pejl9p2i-gnaa calzone , $ 13.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=imk_a-uwhcefgt6r5d04oa#imk_a-uwhcefgt6r5d04oa margherita pizza , $ 12.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=23-ynowsws_1irlhg-gcfq#23-ynowsws_1irlhg-gcfq http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=qnjujuxunratoowv9hyuoa#qnjujuxunratoowv9hyuoa http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=rr8osukgiuh5kkppqtogoa#rr8osukgiuh5kkppqtogoa piccante pizza , $ 13.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=mza3u7wfdoha8bzyfaknha#mza3u7wfdoha8bzyfaknha http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=0-o-_nrm67jrwoytqazhyg#0-o-_nrm67jrwoytqazhyg nutella pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=ld4wgjburk6niygon6xjvw#ld4wgjburk6niygon6xjvw panna cotta w/caramel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cove-trattoria-paradise-valley?select=umvp1e9r-ounmycekxepbw#umvp1e9r-ounmycekxepbw by far , our favorite menu items are the bruschetta and the pizza . what makes their bruschetta unique is the tiny slivers of proscuitto they mix in with the capers , onions , garlic , tomatoes , and basi . it gives it a slightly salty flavor that goes well with the sweet tomatoes . the pizza dough they use is really soft/fluffy and in my opinion is very addictive . the portion size of the pizza is just right for one person with a big appetite , which is me . overall , it 's a nice place to have dinner . we 'll definitely be back . return factor - 95 %		4		1
it was the 6th month anniversary for the breakfast club uye -lrb- woot woot -rrb- and the placed picked to try was matt 's big breakfast . i picked this place because i had heard they do take reservations of a large groups and thought how sweet is that , i called them and verified that they do , then told them i would call back with the final details . when i got all the information , called them back and told them what day & time and how many , and was told then that the reservations is actually for groups of 5 or smaller : -lrb- whomp whomp , but was told that they could hold a party of 15 we just needed to get on the list , and then she asked what is the meaning for the reservations , and i said we are monthly breakfast club and we picked matt 's to try this month , i was then told that matt 's turns tables over fast is it 's not really the type of place to hold meetings , i laughed and said the type of meetings we are doing is eating . got there around 8am on sat morning , put my name on the list for a party of 15 , i was then told that the entire party needs to be there in ordered to be seated , i told her that i would need to be saving one seat , someone is running late , i was told only way to save a seat is to order their food for them that way all orders are going in at the same time . just stating this on the review to give people with groups the heads up . everyone showed up , and we were seated pretty quickly ! when i figured out that we were headed to matt 's big breakfast , what i wanted to order , had to have , needed to taste was there waffles , when i got into matt 's and seated at the table i looked up and saw the daily special and said , oh that 's what i 'm having . it was three eggs scrambled with schriener 's chorizo fresh jalapeños cheddar cheese and home fries and flour tortilla . this dish was delish !! the jalapenos where so fresh !! the home fries were perfectly cooked ; the eggs & chorizo were very good stuffed in that flour tortilla ! only thing that could have made this better was some great hot sauce ! the dish for me was lacking in heat , but was great in flavor ! i did see a waffle or 2 at the table , and let me tell you , they looked great , but i think i made the right choice , see i like to have some waffle of pancake with my syrup and at matt 's you get 2 ounces of real maple syrup , additional 2 ounces can be bought for a buck 50 , so if it was me , i would be spending like 5 bucks just on syrup . wonder if i can bring in my own haha i have wanted to try matt 's big breakfast for a very long time now and am very happy i did , everything is fresh and fast ! i look forward to coming back !		4		1
so there was a time when i had no idea who or what jimmy john 's was . i mean unless you 're from the midwest or somewhere central i doubt coasters and those of us in between had ever heard of this awesome sub place . i 'd like to think my encounter with jimmy john 's was fate ... although through unusual circumstances , a story for another time ; -- rrb - my first try was a complimentary sample by a certain gentleman ... well the thing is i kind of forgot his name ... oops ! that first time ... i got to try the # 5 vito . it was a mouthful , he never told me it was that big , and so thick but my first bite into it i handled it like a champ , and i just kept on eating it and swallowing until it was all done , i was satisfied , and afterwards i made a mental note that i would return because i was craving more . i 've only had two menu items and that 's the # 5 and the # 11 both delicious creations , i ca n't explain the bread , it 's a white sub but it 's really good . they do n't toast it , i like the contrast of a cold loaf with a hot filling ... in the end it 's a good feeling . and the times they are open make them especially awesome ! phoenix now has become a late night city with a little more places open past 10p and i love jimmy john 's for that , now after a late night on mill ave and kinda buzzed from the tavern ... i have choices other than the mill staples of slices , the hot dog place , well basically the stretch of late night food places on 6th ave. now i can walk to jimmy 's and grab a yum sub ! so love ya and yes i 'm a fan ... thanks my mr.-stery encounter for introducing me to jimmy 's ... and i 'll see ya again jimmy john 's for my # 5 !		4		1
so currently the hubby and i are in the process of buying a house . we had to drive out to north scottsdale to sign some paperwork and since we were in the area we stopped in at the skeptical chymist for dinner and drinks . i found the price of food and drinks to be slightly pricey and that would be my only complaint about this place . the food however is very tasty . i ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered the mustard crusted tenderloin stuffed with spinach . i got a bit of food envy when i tasted my husbands food . i would recommend ordering that dish . the fish and chips were decent . you get a big beer battered filet which is nicely seasoned with thick chips . being a proud irish lass i enjoy irish pubs that actually play great irish music and skeptical chymist does a great job . sure you hear the cliche , popular bands like u2 and the cranberries , but they also played the pogues and some traditional irish songs . the place had a great look and feel to it . they really made it look as close to a traditional irish pub and i felt really comfortable just hanging out and drinking my smithwicks . on this particular evening the place was pretty sparse , not many people , but i 'm sure on weekends this place gets hoppin ' . the fact that this place played the pogues should warrant a five star review , but because i find the prices to be slightly high they only get four stars . i would definitley go back if i 'm in the neighborhood again .		4		1
i like this place because it 's unique . the restaurant is actually in a basement of the building hence the name salt cellar . i always go during happy hour when prices are cheaper because this place is rather expensive . oh seating is not suitable for really large groups . there 's a bar and then there are smaller tables in a separate small room . other than the prices , the food is good and the atmosphere is great . it has that private posh bar feel with dim lighting . try the turtle soup , steamed mussels and the raw oysters . the steamed mussels can be eaten without any sauce . it 's that tasty . the escargot is nice too . the baked oyster was kind of bland . but you 'll have to try it yourself . this place is for people that want to be fancy for the night . eat and drink like an important person . service is not bad and the food is good . and like i said , it 's unique atmosphere . just be prepared to pay the premium for it .		4		1
scottsdale is so many things , shopping , nightclubs , excessive , culinary delight , etc. . it is also a neighborhood , if you take the time to look past everything else . if you stumbled into ra or stingray sushi on one of your forgettable nights drinking , keep going to those `` other '' sushi places . if you want a neighborhood feel , great service , excellent portions and a great price point , check out sakana . they have 4 locations in the valley . this location is only one that i have visited so far . i met dhargya there last night , he wanted to introduce two european beauties to great sushi . it was `` we are the world '' all over again . dhargya is from tibet , manu - italy -lrb- near lake como -rrb- , natalia - ukraine , and me - pittsburgh -lrb- proud of it -rrb- . the 4 of us ate until full and even managed to take home some vegetable tempura . for $ 100 , including tip and many bottles of hot sake , i would say it is a steal . be forewarned though - if you arrive between 6:30 and 8pm , there will probably be a waiting list .		4		1
whenever possible i like to support local business , so i tried copper star . i ordered a coffee and a sandwich . the sandwich was surprisingly good . i expected a decent -lrb- at best -rrb- sammy and i was shocked at how tasty it was . the coffee was good , but the sandwich stole the show . who knew you could get a great sammy at a coffee shop . the only concern i had with my visit was the employee who helped me . before i dive into that , let me just say i 'm young and not conservative . that being said - it is distracting/disturbing to have so much `` art '' on your face . this employee had massive amounts of eye makeup , paired with multiple face piercings and what looked like a tea saucer implanted in their chin . it was distracting to the point that i had a hard time making eye contact . again - i 'm all about expressing yourself , but maybe do n't be excessively tatted , overly pierced and make up applied by a sugared up five year old - all at the same time . pick one look per day .		4		1
what a surprise ! this place is pretty darn good . when a colleague called me up to go to lunch and said `` hey , let 's go to grassroots '' , my immediate response was `` dude , that 's not one of those healthy vegan places is it ? because i do n't like those kind of restaurants '' ... he laughed and said `` trust me , this is your kind of place '' ... he was right . we met around 11:30 am for lunch and the parking lot in the shopping center it 's in was jam packed . when it 's mid-day in arizona , the last thing you want to do is park far away from the restaurant and walk in dress clothes to/from your car ... it 's too hot . in this case , i had to park really far away in the parking garage . the parking situation gets 1 star . the food and service on the other hand gets a solid 4 stars . i decided to go with the smoked bbq beef brisket sandwich w/fries , $ 13 . http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grassroots-kitchen-and-tap-scottsdale?select=fd9b4buf72anw5be3sfiza#fd9b4buf72anw5be3sfiza i immediately fell in love with the sandwich after 1 bite . the cole slaw that was put on top of the brisket was the perfect compliment ... this thing is full of flavor . however , it was messy ... i do n't recommend it for a business lunch ... i am trying to stop ordering messy menu items during business lunches , but for some reason i ca n't stop . good thing i did n't get any on me . our server was attentive and friendly . despite the joint being packed for lunch and crazy busy , she was able to ensure we were well taken care of . tip - ask for a table away from the front door . there are several tables near the front door and we sat at one of them . since it 's so busy , there are 2 things about those tables that are bad ... the constant opening of the door lets in the 400 degree convection oven air from the sonoran desert and it 's very hard to stay cool ... the other thing is that when people wait for their table , they 're almost on top of you . that said , next visit we 'll sit in the back . return factor - 85 %		4		1
the first time i went to la bocca was with my good friend kim . she and i met up there and had a very ... off experience . our waiter seemed new and seemed very flustered . he told us the kitchen was super busy ... despite the fact that the restaurant was barely half full . anyways , i came back with kim and friends for her birthday this past weekend , and i am so glad i did ! here goes : atmosphere : we all know mill ave can get a little wild , and quite a mish mosh of folks on saturday night . so , that being said when i walked into la bocca i felt that the environment was very cool and sophisticated , while still being young . drinks : $ 5 sangria and a pitcher for $ 18 ? sign me up . everyone at the table drank sangria save for one couple that ordered bells ... which is a delicious beer out of k-zoo michigan : -rrb- . anyhow , everyone enjoyed the rojo sangria . food : hello deliciousness ! i had the chopped salad and a truffle mushroom pizza . i ate the entire salad which had little tubetti pastas , bacon , blue cheese crumbles and a phenominal dijon vinagrette . the pizza ... dear diary i am in love with this pizza . mozzarella , goat cheese , mushrooms , truffle oil , tomato , fresh spinach ... literally slices of heaven in my mouth . i ate all but two slices . thats way more than anyone my size should ever eat . must do that again . the server : he was cool and seemed to have no problem handling the whole table of us . he even brought kim carmel ice cream with a candle . a trick candle at that . kudos my man . overall , we had a great time at la bocca , and despite the strange experience the first time around i 'll definately be returning .		4		1
this is one of those reviews that i wish i could give a half star to and make it 3.5 . i 've been teetering on 3 and 4 , but i 'm going to round up and give it four because i liked everything about this place , i just did n't love everything about it . i like that this is a homey little shop situated in a converted house . i like how they offer counter ordering as well as sit-down dining . i also like how they have an extensive ice cream selection staring at me when i walk inside . the food is decent . the bread is soft , the salad was ok . i got half and half ... half greek salad and a half of the prosciutto mozzarella sandwich based on the raving yelp reviews . the greek salad was pretty tasty but they went really heavy on the dressing . next time i will ask for it on the side . i liked the bread , vinegar , mozzarella and peppers in the prosciutto sandwich . i was n't a huge fan of the prosciutto though . i found chunks in my prosciutto and i just was n't prepared for chunky meat , more the thinly sliced prosciutto . the sandwich was ok though and i finished it , but i 'll probably order something different next time . i know that a lot of the reviews talk about the service , but i thought the service was pretty good ! the gentleman working the restaurant is an older man , with a tough east coast attitude , but he softened up and tried to make light and friendly conversation in his own way . i enjoyed the service and it made me feel like i was in my old italian relative 's home for dinner . this place definitely has character and i 'm glad i paid it a visit . it 's hard to remember to visit since it 's on busy 7th street and you can easily pass it before you realize you did . but if anything , i suggest you stop in for a homemade iced tea and gelato . the atmosphere is quaint and charming .		4		1
we had a groupon for taberna and decided on a whim to use it last night . i was really craving a good margarita . i did n't know what to expect since the reviews were mixed but i was pleased for the most part . when we got there on a busy friday night , there was a 15 minute wait . so we got a couple drinks at the bar . the female bartender was n't the warm and fuzzy type , but she did make some killer margaritas . my husband had their specialty margarita , served up . it was sooo smooth and delicious and definitely tasted premium . i had a cilantro/jalapeno margarita . it was very good but did n't have as much of the cilantro and jalapeno flavor that i was expecting . both margaritas packed a good punch . we were pleasantly buzzed by the time our table was ready . although they were a bit pricy i would much rather spend $ 9 on an excellent margarita then $ 5 on a watered down , crappy one . our service started out good . the chips and salsa were very good . the plantains and yucca chips were a unique and tasty touch . after taking our order , our server asked if we want some guacomole along with our chips . we politely declined and i detected a bit of an eyebrow raise from our server . after returning to bring us straws for our water , i placed an order for a glass of sangria and also let her know that we had a groupon . although the change in her behavior was n't drastic it was definitely there . we were then often forgotten the rest of the night . we waited about a full 10 minutes for water refills . and my sangria took about 20 minutes . she apologized to me saying that my order was placed last in the big drink order . whatever . the food was very good . portion sizes much smaller than what i 'm used too with mexican food . however , if you imagine most of the entrees as small plates and order a few sides or appetizers , it will be more than enough . i ordered the chili relleno with a side of the poblano potatoes . -lrb- most entrees do n't come with sides of anything - another downside . -rrb- the chili relleno was stuffed with veggies and cheese . it was much lighter than the cheesy battered rellenos i 'm used to . but it was very good . the poblano potatoes were sublime . everyone must try them ! my husband ordered the scallop and pork belly tacos . he was a little thrown off by the size -lrb- four bite size tacos -rrb- but luckily tacos come with rice and beans . he thought they were very good . overall we thought the food was very good . a modern twist on mexican . however we were disappointed by the service . this has happened before to us with groupons . i think servers feel that just because we have a groupon we will be cheap , when we actually tip 25 % on average . in fact , when the server brought us our bill she said `` congratulations ! '' because it was under $ 1 with our groupon . maybe she was just trying to be funny but i was n't amused . but we still gave her a damn good tip on the original bill , well over 20 % .		4		1
kg is the spot to be seen and heard ! the usual fridays it seems , i would roll up down camelback rd from the 51 after work hours , 5pm-ish . now , if you are lucky enough , you and your peeps you were suppose to meet up with will find an open spot . nine out of ten times , we are not so lucky as it seems , always ! yes , a temporary glitch to a good time after a long work week ! so , the quick solution is to just grab some booze from the bar , the usual heineken , and wait for the next open table and hope that the party occupying your table-to-be leaves before hh ends ! my cuatro stars is based solely on my hh delights and experience . the sushi and drinks offered here during hh is nothing stellar , but has an appealing price tag that runs you $ 3-5 a pop . the menu indeed is limited to some of your basic sushi rolls such as the california and shrimp tempura . another favorite is the calamaris . the quality is average at best while still satisfying both our wallets and taste bud . in my typical setting of anywhere from six to a dozen peeps , we typically like to down our apps with sake and japanese beer such sapporo or kieren . wait , is n't that a recipe for a sake bomber ? yes , yes it is ! if you do n't mind the noisy chatter from every which direction meaning the table next to you or the traffic coming in and out of fashion square , bumping music in this hostile social environment on an early friday evening , possibly a slight chance of waiting for an opened seating , and a very attractive on-a-low-budget happy hour menu , i highly recommend this i am too cool-for-you old town scene .		4		1
i finally went to canal on saturday night with two girlfriends for a girls night out in old town . canal was a great choice for dinner and drinks to start the evening . we sat inside in a booth and during the night some ladies in another group decided to strut their stuff on the catwalk ... ahhhh , only in scottsdale ! i loved the fashion shows being shown on three screens . our waitress was awesome on saturday evening . she answered all of our questions , was very knowledgable about the menu and drinks , and paid the perfect amount of attention to our table . our group of three split the scallop trio and the parmesan fries . both were huge hits with the three of us . i thought the amount of fries we received was very generous , considering they were only $ 5 . the scallops were cooked perfectly and it was a nice way to start our meal . i had the caesar salad as my dinner and it was the perfect size . my two friends both had the mahi-mahi tacos which they both really liked , especially since the fish was not fried . we all also really liked the cornbread that came in the bread basket because it had a bit of a kick to it . the sauvignon blanc wine i tried was really good and reasonably priced at $ 8 for the glass . i also tried the fuji apple martini which tasted incredibly fresh -lrb- our waitress informed us that they only use fresh fruit for their cocktails ... no sugar or syrup additives thankfully -rrb- and was priced at $ 10 . one of my friends tried the strawberry smash martini which she really liked . our bill was $ 128 which i thought was reasonable given the fact we had 6 alcoholic beverages , 2 small plates , a salad , and 2 entrees . canal was a chic space and we really enjoyed our dinner there . it is definitely a place i would go for dinner or drinks with my girlfriends .		4		1
i like this bookman 's . they have a wide variety of items from books , music , movies , video games , musical instruments and what i refer to as `` garage sale junk '' . the `` junk '' is unique memorabilia -lrb- including action figures , toys , etc -rrb- and random statues , plates , candle holders , home decorating items , etc. - just a bunch of random stuff from a variety of decades . sometimes there can be good stuff -lrb- the cute owl figurine i purchased -rrb- or not . coming to bookman 's is like signing up for a treasure hunt where you might not find anything good at the end but you keep coming back because you have found good stuff previously . i 've purchased books , movies , and video games here . the best part is that you can trade-in items you no longer want and either get cash or store credit . you receive almost double store credit than cash and if bookman 's has something good , then it 's a great deal . i would definitely recommend trading in some items you no longer use/want .		4		1
wandering through first friday , i was craving somethin' sweet . not having tried sweet republic before i was intrigued by their lil ` bus . as i stood back to read the menu i was intrigued by what i saw ... i -lsb- heart -rsb- bacon ... sweet salted caramel ... mmmmmm . always looking to try something new and always down for caramel i was torn on which one to choose ... the universe provided me with my answer as a man in front of me orders a double with a scoop of the i -lsb- heart -rsb- bacon and the caramel ... -lsb- thank you -rsb- ... i decided on the same ! the bacon was a rich creamy sweet cream base with these small bits of slightly salty , slightly sugary , slightly smokey bacon morsels . kind of reminded me of a toasted candied pecans and salted peanuts on my ice cream but better . come on people it is bacon we 're talking about here !! wow ! totally not what i expected ! the salted caramel , was very good also but relative to what i paired it up to it was mild by comparison . also i am kind of spoiled by the occasional treat of hagen daz 's signature fleur de sel caramel ice cream with mini chocolate caved salted caramels . ooh my goodness 's * sooooo good . it 's been a week and i can still remember that flavor like it was yesterday 's folks i -lsb- heart -rsb- bacon !		4		1
my freddy 's frozen custard rating 2.5 had been * generously * rounded up to a 3 , but no longer ... i dropped 'em down . http://www.yelp.com/biz/freddys-frozen-custard-and-steak-burgers-glendale#hrid:gvlhtxnxg9papblwxnuq6w i went to culver 's , basically . now i get what freddy 's is trying to be . although freddy 's has a mythology that lays claim to being the originator of the burger style , culver 's just does it better . they do everything better . from friendly customer service , cleanliness , to the fresh and tasty food ; and the thick yet crisp on the outside crinkle cut frys were simply a model of perfection on the delicate greasy ~ crispy spectrum . the burger ? even though it was still in the take-two-patties-at-a-time thin style , each of these patties was about as thick as the two put together at freddy 's . the flavor really proved that it was fresh , not frozen meat pre-grilling . the meat was cooked all the way through , and yet still juicy . http://www.yelp.com/biz/steakenburger-long-wongs-phoenix#hrid:k1gltivzimd5el_e8qg2ia the basic sundae automaticaly comes with 2 flavors of topping , so they are n't trying to unfairly skrimp you for skrilla left and right with extras . very cool , culver 's ! boo freddy 's for being so lackluster with customer service , overseasoned with food , and generally failing .		4		1
had some foody friends from denver in town so we wanted to experience with them . seated near the back patio door which was cold and smokey when they opened the door . do n't sit there ! like others have said , the interior was kinda like a mini chelsea 's kitchen . server was on her game and very helpful . had downloaded the menu from the site so was ready to order a rib eye -lrb- ? -rrb- , but was informed that the old menu was on the site ! * smh * . online world chef - please be on top of that . apps - super creamy grits & schreiner 's sausage trio and the oven roasted organic beets . i would never order the beets , but it was friggin good ! dinner - mrs. had the pork osso buco confit , i had the roasted & grilled pork chop . this goodness under $ 20 ! this is why this place is packed all the time ! desserts - started with the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores . ok , alot of reviews that this was unbelievable , super good , etc. . i love bacon ! but this was kinda meh . after a good meal , you want something equally good for dessert . we ordered the death by chocolate ... redemption ! besides that bad table location , everyone had a great meal . the service was excellent and the prices were reasonable . overall , i will be back !		4		1
i ca n't believe it has taken us 5 months to find this place since we moved here in november . given how much we miss our home back in denver , colorado , boulders was like a little taste of home ; laid back people , friendly staff , bikes and rock climbing gear scattered about , veggie friendly menu and more . i have a few things that bumped this down from a 5 to a 4 : a -rrb- they have fat tire all over the place ; fat tire coasters , fat tire decoration on their specials board , bikes here and there , etc. . but when my partner was so delighted to be able to get her favorite brew , fat tire , and tried to order it , they explained that they did n't * actually * have fat tire . she wound up getting an odell 's -lrb- another co microbrewery -rrb- , which was good ... but was very disappointed . b -rrb- the menu had some intense mis-spellings , things that if they 'd ran a spell check , they would have fixed . like vegitarian . as a marketing person , errors like that always annoy me . nit-picky ? yes . but that 's how i am . c -rrb- our first waiter made this whole deal about how he was going off shift to drink with his friends , and would have someone else take care of us , and bid us farewell . and then came back not , once , but twice . a little odd . d -rrb- the bathrooms were a bit gross , and the ads expired in 2008 ? however , the food was delicious . our server lindsay was new , so she had to check on a few things , but was friendly , timely , and made us feel very welcome . while the people who came with us were n't impressed with their wings , the dip we got was delicious , and our other friend was super happy with their pizza . we felt like we were at home . what a nice feeling . yes , i 'm a bit picky about little things , but over all , we loved the atmosphere , the food , the microbrews , and the friendliness . i think we 've found out local bar until we moved back to co. .		4		1
given the scarcity of good ethnic options in the north scottsdale area , indian paradise deserves another star . we 've been on an ethnic binge this week and decided to check out the buffet lunch again . the garlic naan was brought hot to the table and refilled when our basket went empty . it had a great crispy charred exterior . the tandoori chicken tasted brined which probably contributed to the tenderness . pretty good selection of veg options like veg korma -lrb- mild creamy sauce -rrb- , dal makhani -lrb- lentils -rrb- , chana masala -lrb- chickpeas -rrb- and saag -lrb- spinach -rrb- with potatoes . all in all a great value and we look forward to coming back for the weekend champagne brunch which is priced at $ 11.95 and includes one drink . buffet offering is also supposed to be more extensive . do n't forget to grab a bag of crispy spiced snacks on the way out . they 're better than chips and very addictive .		4		1
what a treat to have press within walking distance of my house !! after walking by a few times and from the yelp reviews , i convinced the bf that we should skip sbucks for a day and give it a try ! i am so glad we did as it is as great as described by the other yelpers ! all the staff is extremely helpful , nice and overall , super pleasant ! the chai tea -lrb- both hot and iced -rrb- is probably the best i have had in p-town ! the bf really likes their regular lattes as well , but he would tell you to ask for it extra hot if you like hot lattes ! -lrb- cool shapes with the milk too ! -rrb- they carry a great assortment of wines , including the bottle i just drank at razz 's a couple weeks ago , which is really hard to find . they also do a lot of events -lrb- bbq 's , dog events etc -rrb- that seem like fun and i can tell there is already a ` local ' group that hangs out there on the weekend mornings . another bonus is they are super dog friendly ! bernie will definitely enjoy some time there on the patio -lrb- at least when it cools off ! -rrb- ca n't wait for my next latte !!		4		1
this is a great place to watch sports . they have plenty of tv 's , great food , and a decent selection of beer . i come here to meet colleagues after work for happy hour or to watch a game -lrb- football , basketball , baseball -rrb- ... does n't matter , it 's a great spot . some of my fav 's here : sliders http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-32-sports-grill-scottsdale-2?select=tjmkv2xzlbo1g0jxohwxbq#tjmkv2xzlbo1g0jxohwxbq chili cheese fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-32-sports-grill-scottsdale-2?select=xqv4rlbj5xeafo3dgs6fwa#xqv4rlbj5xeafo3dgs6fwa nachos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-32-sports-grill-scottsdale-2?select=g79f3kc9z-rknwlwmaapag#g79f3kc9z-rknwlwmaapag philly cheesesteak sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-32-sports-grill-scottsdale-2?select=6vbae2cpzkbtq0kokqob0a#6vbae2cpzkbtq0kokqob0a spicy boneless wings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-32-sports-grill-scottsdale-2?select=tltrvl7_mcryb-gq_expza#tltrvl7_mcryb-gq_expza every once in a while , they 'll be on groupon . whenever they are , we jump all over that . if you like sports and good food , i highly recommend this place . return factor - 98 %		4		1
this is a great little place in what you might consider an obscure shopping plaza . when i was walking up to pie zano 's to get my carry-out order , i felt transplanted to another place and time . hard to explain , but maybe you can understand . immediately i loved the cobble-stone walkways with surrounding places with patio seating . there was a distinct night chill in the air , so i felt drawn to the orange subtle glow of pie zano 's lights , beckoning me inside . i soon discovered that pie zano 's has weekly specials and hosts acoustic music on thursday evenings . you can even tailor make your own pie or go with one of their own house specials . i ordered the garden and greek . the latter was very , very delicious . if that 's not all , this place also has a coffee menu and offers muffins and fresh fruit , along with -lrb- as everyone has pointed out -rrb- sandwiches and frittatas . the inside seating appears cozy , like you 're sitting among friends , talking about everyday things , like world affairs or music , while you enjoy a one-of-a-kind pie with a glass of wine or beer . i definitely want to go back and dine here . sure , carry out was fantastic and the two pies i ordered were really good , but i think part of pie zano 's experience is being tucked away in the town & country shopping plaza . it 's like a whole ` nother world here and pie zano 's sits among the company of a pita place and a cajun kitchen . pie zano 's is the type of place that 's perfect for any and every occasion . if i lived nearby , i 'd walk here for coffee and breakfast . it 's a great option for lunch , as well . and i 'd definitely treat a friend to a pie . you just ca n't go wrong with pie zano 's . 4 stars - only because i did n't have the complete dining experience .		4		1
scramble has become a new favorite spot for breakfast ... and clearly from the number of people that are packed in on any given visit , i am not alone . this is one of those places that i had to ignore my first impressions . my initial thought was ` oh dear , another trendy spot that never lives up to the hype '' . and with it 's wall menu and counter ordering , it is a trendy . but there are several points that clearly raise the comfort level . between the wall of windows and bright lighting there is an airy feel to the place . the drink bar in the center of the room is a five-star bonus imo . yes , i have been accused of being a control freak in the past -lrb- and they say it like it 's a bad thing ... -rrb- but i love being able to create the perfect cup of coffee , suited for my tastes and mine alone . the tables , while very close together are always serviced immediately to accommodate the constant inflow of patrons . and even though the place always seems to be brimming to the rim , i have never felt rushed through either my meal or my paper . i also love the various selections on the flat screens that encircle the room . there is literally something for everyone -lrb- and how many people can actually say that they shared their yogurt parfait with ed begley jr. on gtv ?!! -rrb- . now for the food . i 've been enough times to have sampled quite a few offerings and have even begun to create a list of favorites . on the top of that favorite list is the gringo-cherrywood bacon , egg & cheddar cheese breakfast burrito . this thing is large enough for two , or a second meal and is literally stuffed full of the perfect balance of egg , meat , and cheese ! ask for extra salsa , because one cup is not nearly enough for this big boy !!! the brizzas -lrb- breakfast pizzas -rrb- and french toast -lrb- baguette slices dipped in vanilla custard -rrb- are also tops on my list . as far as sides go , the scramble hash browns are a must have ! they seem to take a little longer to make and are really more of a hash brown/bacon/cheese tart-lette which are browned to perfection . i have literally had to defend mine from incoming utensils and believe that a quick thrust of the fork to the back of the offenders hand is quite an effective technique ... my only real criticism of the place is that if you have placed separate orders , your food may not be served at the same time . but this is so minor in comparison to the quality and the fact that clearly everything is made to order -lrb- not pre-done and waiting to be placed on a plate -rrb- , that i ca n't really hold this against them . then again , it may simply be that i have an addiction to those hash brown cakes ! ; -rrb- on-line ordering is coming to their website and that will add an additional level of love for this place . this is a welcome addition to the breakfast scene and if you are in need of some flavorful morning num-nums , scramble on over !		4		1
i love lee lee , but so many bad asian drivers in one centrally located spot -- truly my peeps at their finest . i just wait until an hour - ish before closing time and everything is fairly quiet and sometimes they 're putting out veggies for the next day . woo hoo ! forget the early bird , i 'm a night owl . as for the `` weird smell '' as one yelper described , i ignore it . truth is , i 'm used to it and i know it 's the same smell of any asian market , hell even parts of chinatown in san francisco . i 've smelled worse things while traveling the world . lee lee 's your typical asian market -lrb- shout out to 99 ranch in the bay area ! -rrb- , but better organized than other markets i 've been to . the aisles are clearly marked - chinese , indian , etc. . if you ca n't navigate it , then how you navigate the roads here makes me wonder if you should be driving at all . since i 'm hard pressed to find inexpensive filipino food here in the valley , i find i have to make it myself . lee lee 's carries all the stuff that i need to try -lrb- really , it 's try , but never accomplish -rrb- and replicate my mom 's dishes . it 's also really nostalgic for me as well when i go down the cookie/candy aisle and see things like the strawberry pocky sticks or the chocolate pocky sticks ... it reminds me of going to japantown in san jose on sundays after church so mom could get the ingredients for her menus of the week . but what really makes lee lee a winner in my eyes is the desserts from goldilocks bakery as well as their assortment of breads . i 'm a total starch slut , so seeing pan de sal and the filipino desserts makes me happy . i buy a few things and then put them in the fridge so i can munch on them during the week . i also love their frozen food section as well - you can find such a variety of frozen potstickers , indian food , sea food ... it 's a wonder one even thinks of going anywhere else . i like lee lee 's a lot and their selection of fresh fruits and vegetables is one of the better places in the valley ... unless you support your local farmers . service can be rude , but i do n't expect hearts , flowers and puppies in places like this . it is what it is - an asian market .		4		1
awesome place to head before heading off to a sun 's game . in fact , since the sun 's no longer win much any more . . head back at the half if they continue to lose ?! okay . . i kid !!! no ... not jason kidd . we wandered into fuego and got the last seat on the pation about 2 hours before the game mid week . awesome happy hour with alot of good drink and menu choices . better yet the drinks we had were strong . maybe a little too strong ! i had the `` remix sangria '' ... a mix of red and white sangria . my boyfriend , a pomegranate mojito also on the hh menu . good stuff . strong stuff . our apps that we made into dinner were the empanadas : a mixture of beef within pastry , big and hearty ! the fuego nachos with carnitas , very good sized portion . nothing too special or out of the ordinary . the cubano sliders , our very favorite . could have easily passed on the nachos and did another order of sliders . i found the empanadas a little interesting . i have traveled to puerto rico several times and did n't find them to be authentic . i found them good tho ! in pr , they are much smaller and these almost reminded me of a peroshki dish i had in russia once . no matter . it was good . not that expensive for four drinks and 3 generous sized appetizers at a cool place with a super nice waiter .		4		1
i have been to the phoenix zoo twice now . the first time was 3 weeks ago in 104 degree temp . awful experience . we only went around the big animals side so my daughter could see them . all the animals were tired , hot and sleeping . they looked miserable and we were miserable too . the water mists did not help one bit . we also went this past weekend when the temperature was a high of 76 degrees . heaven !!! loved the zoo . had so much fun . no need to rush . we just relaxed . all the kids were in a great mood . people were smiling , laughing , just having plain ol fun . the animals seemed alive and active . just a beautiful experience . the arizona trail is great . it might have been good to go there with the hot temperatures as well . some animals are hard to see because of the layout in the cages . the cages are smaller than needed for some of these large cats and other wild life . the orangutans have a little baby orangutan in it and he just hangs and plays while the big guys sleep . it was really cool . my favorite part is the giraffes . there were 5 of them this last time .		4		1
one of my favorite bars downtown . i always run into friends or make new ones when i 'm there . i 've seen some great shows too . -lrb- i met lady bunny here . -rrb- the back patio is huge and is equipped with a full service bar . there are stairs that go up to a little deck that over looks the patio . inside is comfortable , clean , friendly , nicely decorated . i would n't call it a video bar , but there are screens with music videos playing both inside and out back . the music is usually at an appropriate level with just the right amount of light : not too dark but not bright as the noon day sun either . i do n't like going out to places to sit in the dark and scream at my friends all night . amsterdam is not like that . parking is pretty good , but take the light rail , it goes right by amsterdam . some times if there are big events going on , it can get pretty packed . other times are a little slower . -lrb- just like anywhere else . -rrb-		4		1
so just in case this is the first review you 've read about this place , let me be the one to tell you - it 's vegan . not vegetarian -lrb- no meat , but eggs and dairy -rrb- , but vegan . and several of their dishes are mock - made to resemble normal meat dishes -lrb- hot dogs , burgers , chicken , etc. -rrb- . i know that right there either turns people on or off . me , i dig it . my freezer 's stocked with boca , morning star , quorn and gardenburger products . that said , not all of their mock products work . while i love heir spicy buffalo wings , crab puffs , vegan chili fries and mum 's meatball po-boy , i was disappointed with the no harm chicken parm sandwich and the vegan hot dogs . have n't built up the courage to try their pizzas just yet - my previous experience with vegan cheese has n't been all that great . but i 'm sure i 'll get around to it eventually , i stop by for lunch with my meat-eating friends at least once a month . but do n't worry , mock is n't all they have to offer . they 've also got tofu - a spicy peanut tofu appetizer as well as a good variety of noodle and rice bowls . and it 's a pretty cool place - i really dig the decor , from the volkswagen doors along an entire wall to the local art work .		4		1
4.5 stars -lrb- i 've never met a place that i 'd give 5 stars to as `` the best i 've ever had '' -rrb- very cool place . i read about this in the newspaper and then heard nothing but great reviews . after a night out with friends we decided -lrb- i convinced -rrb- that we should check it out for dessert . i heard about the pb & j pasty so i wanted to try . we showed up at 10pm on a friday and the seating was ample for our group of 8 . the chairs are church pews and the decoration/ambience is really , really well done . the staff is extremely nice and helpful -lrb- and fast -rrb- . we had a few banoffee -lrb- which although sounds like coffeee , has nothing of the sort in it -rrb- and pb & j desserts which were great . admittedly the pb & j was really , really sweet . but i still ate it all . i ca n't wait to come back for their other food for lunch/dinner . i was recommended to try the royale with cheese pasty upon return -lrb- an homage to pulp fiction , of course -rrb- . try this place out ! i do n't drink , but looked like a great hang-out if you do .		4		1
it is brave to make yet another mexican restaurant in an area flooded with them . the key here is uniqueness . at first i was a bit reluctant as restaurants in hotels do n't tent to be that great . on the outside there is a bright orange eatery inside a repainted old hotel . the entrance is also the hotel lobby entrance , and the hostess stand is located awkwardly in the middle of the dinning room . for lunch it was quiet busy with with many parties of 2 filling up the 4 tops and a sole person holding down a table of 8 , so we sat at the dark bar . a quick glance at the menu found a few veggie options like veggie tacos and fish tacos . i went with 2 veggie one fish and we split a guacamole . the guacamole was good , rough mashed avocado with cojeta cheese on top . the real star was the red hot sauce , it was thick like a paste , and had a really deep flavor beyond that of just spicy . the chips were nothing special . our tacos arrive in a neat meal \ / \ / \ / . with one lime per 3 tacos . the veggies were good nicely roasted with a nice texture and savory rich flavor . the tortilla was a crude hand made tortilla that had a moist thickness to it that i liked . the fish in the fish taco had a great flavor sear to it . i saw on the board a 2 for 1 taco tuesday that would be a great deal . either way i just want more of that hot sauce .		4		1
thank you phx for not completely sucking in the indian food sector . this place was a surprise . i wo n't compare it to anything in la , because its hard to beat their cost and taste . but the food was affordable and the flavors were enjoyable . when i ate the murg makhani or the beghan bhatra , i was n't angry ! everything tasted fresh , the dinner buffet looked good , and the owners are very hospitable . sooooo much better than guru palace ... i do n't understand how anyone can eat there . i did n't have the dinner buffet , but since it looked fresh and included lassi and chai , $ 9 seems like a great value and will definitely indulge in it next time . at the end , they gave us some gulab jamun and it was warn and cooked well ... not frozen , thank gawd ! my only complaint is that the spice level was a little low for us , but considering the lack of decent indian food in the area , it 's really not a make or break thing . with everything we ordered , plus leftovers , we got out of there for less than $ 30 .		4		1
i did n't attend last year -lrb- with no regrets based on previous feedback -rrb- , but when i saw that the new times had addressed a lot of the issues from last year 's event , i decided to buy some tickets for our group with the yelp discount to check it out . we went saturday around 4pm , and had no issues with parking -lrb- free -rrb- and getting in -lrb- no line -rrb- . we got our wristbands and bought tickets and took a quick lap to see who all was there . all in all , we tried a buffalo chicken cheese steak -lrb- ca n't remember the truck name -rrb- , taste rite , the grilled cheese truck , mellow mushroom , and rockin ' rays . everything we tried was really good , and considering the event , i did n't think it anything was too expensive -lrb- 1-4 tickets per item , or $ 2-8 -rrb- . the longest line while we were there was the grilled cheese truck , and we made that our second to last stop since it looked like the most popular . they had a lot of great options and since i could n't eat them all , i 'll be going to the scottsdale street fair this weekend to try some more : -rrb- they made great improvements and hopefully next year i will take advantage of the vip passes .		4		1
what a lovely afternoon with fine folks and good food . viet kitchen is an aesthetically pleasing restaurant with very friendly staff members and good food . my meal was delicious . i had the stir fry -- -lrb- 7a -rrb- on the menu . we all shared an order of spring rolls . the only thing strange was that our food all came out at different times instead of all at once . since it was only a minute or two apart l am okay with it i suppose . maybe this is how they do it here . that might be an issue for some old school service folks so a heads up . at this location all the staff members chip in so the food was delivered by different servers when it came up . i am okay with that since i like hot , and not sitting until the server can get to it , meal deliveries . i only mention it because i know some folks might be bothered by that . to be honest i like places that group serve . in my opinion it makes the service , and food temperature , better . i found the staff here to be absolutely wonderful . they fawned all over us from the moment we walked in until the very end of the day when i went back in to use the bathroom . even after all the customers had left the restaurant and the staff were eating their lunch . they did not act put out that i returned after about 15 minutes . such nice people . they were very accommodating , nice , helpful , made good suggestion , were always smiling and very friendly . all in all , i had a great afternoon with precious friends .		4		1
i am going to give this place 4 stars purely because the hostess was so incredibly nice and helpful . i arrived at around 6:30 and tables were filling up fast . i told the hostess that 1 -rrb- i do n't know how many people would be joining me , 2 -rrb- i do n't know how long it will be before they all arrive and 3 -rrb- i wanted a table by a tv so i could watch the sugar bowl . she told me to relax , grab a beer at the bar and she 'll take care of everything . sure enough about 5 minutes later she came over and grabbed me , told me that a 4-top just left and i should sit there and hold on to that spot before someone else gets it . long story short , 2 friends showed up 5 minutes later and we had a decent meal . the sushi is interesting , most of it could probably pass for soft candy as everything was covered in a syrupy sauce but also full of flavor . and apparently they have happy hour 24-7 so the drinks were a very good value . as long as they keep hiring friendly people to man the joint i am comfortable recommending this place . fair warning - the whole atmosphere is 100 % pure scottsdale . walls of leather and suede covered in various shades of purples and pinks complete with hand blown pendant lights , so if that kind of ambiance bothers you , you might want to go somewhere else .		4		1
scott 's generations restaurant & deli is probably the best delicatessen in the phoenix market ! they are conveniently located at north 7th street and missouri and a strip center with an ace hardware and basha 's . i met some yelper 's friends , rand h. , robyn n. , and mike c. for a uye some weeks ago here for lunch . the restaurant is bigger than what it looks like from the outside . it 's a very clean place with plenty of celeb pics on walls from their prior visits to scott 's . the service was very good . our server was exceptional at keeping our drinks filled and serving . i had a hot pastrami on rye with a side or potato salad and coleslaw . the pastrami sandwich was huge and it rated a 7 on a 1-5 scale for taste !! i bet it weighed over 1lb by it 's self . it was full of pastrami-goodness with a hint of dressing that tasted fantastic ! it was one of the best pastrami sandwiches i 've had . the potato salad was not the same `` rock star '' status with a somewhat bland taste and it was too runny . the coleslaw was not bad but not great and it played a better accompaniment to the delicious pastrami sandwich which was the `` rock star '' . i topped it off with a huge glass of iced tea and i was full for two days afterwards : -- rrb - if you 're looking for a really good deli , this is the place ! i look forward to visiting scott 's generations again soon and try their smoke white fish or belly lox . i will probably take some pastrami to go ~ it 's that good . i hope to see you there !		4		1
10/15 popped in for a late lunch constituting of an alsatian onion tart and a glass of wine . i stopped by during happy hour , which meant the tart was $ 7 -lrb- orig . $ 9 -rrb- , and $ 2 off glasses of wine . bartender jimmy was kind enough to give me samples of two reds and a rose , before i decided on a riesling , instead . enjoyed the generous pour , which was later added to when jimmy accidently knocked the decanter down when we shook hands : -rrb- the tart came out a little burnt , and the gruyere was replaced with a milder `` fromage blanc , '' but overall , it still made for a very tasty lunch/dinner ! photos will prove that i ate at least 5.5 slices . read my lips : i ate the whole thing . happy hour apps menu include onion soup gratin , country pate , escargots , onion tart , and a frisee salad for about $ 2 less than standard menu . $ 5 ipas , $ 3 off wine cocktails -lrb- reg . $ 10 -rrb- , and $ 2 off glasses of wine . -lrb- i 'm sure there are discounts on drafts and bottles , too , but since i 'm not a beer-drinker , i did n't make a special note of this . -rrb- i hope more food will be added to the menu . sad news : the toffee sticky pudding has been omitted from the current menu , with no hope of it coming back again . -lrb- strange that , since jimmy said it was a very popular dessert . -rrb- the crowd this monday afternoon was very thin -lrb- 4:00 ` ish -rrb- - a couple of tables outside , and me at the bar . a man sat at a table behind me waiting for his date , and another man who recently relocated from san fran sat a couple of seats from me later on . looks like a decent wine list . another hh special - a complimentary cheese plate -lrb- $ 18 value -rrb- accompanies each bottle of wine ordered -lrb- prices range from $ 30 and up -rrb- !		4		1
visit 2 , this time for dinner : crostini with garlic goat 's milk butter pasta e fagioli - native seed search beans , house made orchiette cheese plate with candied nuts , fig orange marmalade , pear - red barn cheddar , gorgonzola , ` goat ' cheese roasted beets with wild greens , warm goat cheese , champagne vinaigrette , pistachio house bread with pac sun olive oil az sonoran white wheat crespelle with escarole , homemade ricotta , tomato sauce faella spaghetti with bianco dinapoli tomato , basil crispy potato gnocchi with brown butter , sage , parmesean reggiano apple crostata with crema rice pudding with orange fig marmalade having since rebranded the restaurant to trattoria bianco after installing a stone oven to make his legendary pies the first meal i enjoyed with my family after driving back from las vegas was at italian restaurant . having already visited the pizzeria , pane , and italian restaurant for lunch myself this was my first dinner at a bianco restaurant and arriving to find the space bustling we opted to sit outdoors in order to avoid the noise ; a big mistake that instead led to both captain and a server named adam largely ignoring us throughout the evening as water went unfilled , dishes were dropped off without description , ingredient questions required further investigation with the kitchen , and epic delays occurred between each course , plate pickup , and particularly drop-off and collection of desserts along with the check . moving past service issues , the food was every bit as good as the first visit , the housemade pastas and bread clearly a strong point while fresh local produce shined in a salad with bright , bold vinaigrette and beets sweeter than almost any i 'd previously encountered . unfortunately replacing my all-time favorite corn and pancetta gnocchi with a slightly more seasonal version featuring brown butter and sage the dumplings themselves once again melted in the mouth while the crespelle , a crepe stuffed to bursting with creamy cheese and bitter escarole , topped with bianco 's signature sauce was rustic , simple , and perfect - just the way italian food should be and just the way chris and his team make it at each of their restaurants .		4		1
just happen to be in the area picking up some parts from a vendor for the shop and happened to ask the ups dude where is a good place to eat . he said check this place out . ups drivers are the best for food places . a little tricky to find . located in a light industrial park . good thing i had my smart phone to ask it for directions . got the dynamite sandwich with hot links and fries . also ordered a side of kentucky bleu cheese coleslaw to check out the flavors . large portions for a decent price . food was tasty . pretty good sized menu with a range of items that differ from most bbq places . different types of sauces on the table to choose from depending on what you like . service was extremely friendly and helpful . inside was nice and clean . i hear they have an all you can eat buffet on the first wednesday of the month for a great price . looking forward to going back again to try more stuff . smokin !		4		1
why would you name a restaurant after a thing designed to keep people out ? just like china this place is huge inside , and even has tanks of live fish . the menu is huge , and this is just the menu for the gringos . if you know chinese there is a whole menu of family meals that you can order from . there are many vegetarian dishes not just the usual tofu and veggies , they have a large selection of exotic mushroom and veggie dishes . i had the golden mushrooms with tofu $ 7.99 a house specialty . mitake mushrooms a light brown sauce and huge pillow of soft fried tofu . it was nice ans somewhat light we also had the black mushrooms with chinese greens . $ 9.99 this dish had a very earthy taste and the greens were very fresh but hard to eat with chopsticks . another great dish was the veggie hotpot that had some really interesting textures along with the noodles and veggies . service was a bit lack luster , but maybe that was due to the wedding in the other side . the shopping center it is in is a bit run down too so you are assured you are paying for quality food and not the building . bottom line great selection good flavors good value mediocre service .		4		1
essentially a sports bar , but has a more upscale flair . the decor is nice , and has very open layout -- so an get a bit noisy . so be aware if you planned on having dinner conversation . but because of the open atmosphere , it is great for groups and people watching . i actually love the breakfast here . it is n't as popular as some of the other spots on scottsdale strip -- so you can get seated and served rather quick . also , it is a quick jaunt from the local farmers market , so you can stroll around afterwards . the food is really good , fresh and well presented . i order hot tea for breakfast frequently -- and usually i just get an old lipton bag with luke warm water . this place gave me a nice tray with quality tea , lemon slices and piping hot water in nice mug . their side of fruit is also very nice -- you get a cup of fresh berries instead of the standard old honeydew chunks . dinner is equally nice . you have the standard sports bar options -lrb- burgers , fries , etc. -rrb- , but presentation and quality is stepped up a notch .		4		1
i 've also never had to transition from a purely coffee shop to a coffee + wine + restaurant , etc . they did a good job of keeping the old coffee lux essential intact . the seating rooms for the coffee drinkers -lrb- and laptop users and book readers -rrb- are spread out on opposite sides of the space but there 's always seating available . i have not had a chance to try out the `` complicated to describe '' food here although a sample i got from a fine lady here really got me excited . it is an improvement in regards to the availability of food dishes . it can be a one-stop destination and i hope they do a very good job in all those specific areas in their food and service offering -lrb- besides the excellent coffee which is unequal in this area -rrb- . . i like the fact that i can pace myself to discover new menu items here . from a business perspective , i like to see how management plan to promote and market their new and expanded offerings . like the prior place , the music is still a notch too loud . the art on the wall is not memorable but then again they probably will rotate the selection . it is still slightly crowded after the first opening week . what 's unique in phoenix about this place is that it attracts people from different age sets , artists , punk , fringe groups , professionals , anti-socials , intellectuals etc. . the counter area is busy with the foot traffic and sound of cooking ; an area i tend to avoid . the first week , i took 3 friends on separate trips to this place and they all agree , they like to come back . . so after a while , after this new place is '' broken-in '' , i will want to update my review . enjoy		4		1
wine + happy hour folks ! = 0 i 've never heard of this place but i came here for happy hour with my co workers . everything was reallyyyyy good and reasonably priced . we ordered so many mixtures of things . we got to build our own flatbread and also ordered charcuterie . my bosses ordered everything which was amazingly delicious . the wine ! i love pinot noir so every time i go to any wine bars i love trying them . i ordered the apaltagua reserva . it went down so smoothly . the good news is when you check in you get a free wine tasting ! the second one i chose was the rainstorm . this one was also tasty but has more of a kick to it since there 's cinnamon in it . i really liked this place . everything was delicious and the staff is beyond friendly . they really know their wines ! not to mention they have so many other `` festivities there ! they have a lot of events there , you can join a wine club , they have wine classes , and they even have live music there on friday and saturday ! you ca n't go wrong with a great happy hour and great wine to go with it ! = -rrb-		4		1
after trying this place 2 times i can finally do a review ... i tried the peanut butter burger the first time , sonora burger , which to me is a knife and fork burger ... it was ok , not what i was expecting . i was hoping to be wowed by it since it got an award . i am a fan of peanut butter also , but it did not have a flavor i would care for to have again ? the second time i had the volcano burger , something like that ... it is an indulge only item ... might as well have something no one else makes . it has american , liquid cheese in the meat and it was advised i cut it before i bite into it or you will have burning liquid cheese all over you . this burger only comes medium well with the cheese goo inside . ended up being a knife and fork burger unless you like hot liquid cheese all over your hands . i do like the buns , fresh and soft bread , i used the bread to soak up the liquid cheese goo from the burger . also shared some chili cheese fries and nothing fancy , normal chili cheese , on the larger side , we shared it with four people . unfortunately none of the food items really are a must have and that i must get into my car and drive an hour to have an indulge burger ... i wish this was the case , i will take a road trip for a food craving ... so that is my review of the food , overall i could get the same food at red robin or five guys by my house , 5 minute drive versus an hour . so why the 4 stars ? if i lived closer i would stop for lunch , if i was craving a burger since the staff at the scottsdale location seemed very pleasant and the owner was there . he cares about his company and his customers , if lee ever opens up an indulge burger in surprise i will be there to support local business men like him . he seems to genuinely care about customer satisfaction .		4		1
quite fantastic food with decent service . had the traditional with bacon , eggs -lrb- a bit closer to over hard while i had ordered over medium -rrb- and amazing potatoes , great toast , and a great biscuit . the girlfriend ordered the crab eggs benedict , one of their specials , which was fantastic , except that she found a few pieces of shell , which is a jarring and unpleasant experience in any crab dish . we finished off with the blackberry cinnamon bread pudding and it nearly killed us with its deliciousness . i was dithering on whether or not we could finish an entire serving , and thus , if we should get it to go or not , and the waiter offered to bring out a sample with the rest to go , which was really perfect and totally appreciated . seriously , they say `` award-winning '' and they say it 's great , but until you 've tried this ... you have not had dessert . it . was . incredible . aj 's also has it on sale if you need a quick fix . will be returning definitely . very tasty .		4		1
my visits to pita jungle consists of mostly hits with a few misses . the pros - happy hour is a bargain . $ 3 for any draft and they have good ones . tapas are only a few bucks each . keep in mind these are tapas . the portions are meant to be tiny . but they are perfect for leisurely nibbles . our absolute favorite among the tapas are the mushrooms . garlicky lemony mushrooms . scrumptious . our second favorite is the garlic dip . we actually prefer it over the hummus . the thyme pita is a good deal . $ 2 for a giant pita smothered in herbs , feta , and olives . they have the best coconut curry soup . all their soups are good and usually vegetarian but this one is craveable . my hubby likes their gyro and their fish dishes . the cons - their veggie wrap is not good . i have had it at the other locations and enjoyed it but not so much at this location . too many carrots and too dry . my husband did n't care for their chicken . he said it was n't bad ... it just was n't anything special . service can be a bit apathetic . servers do not look pleased to be there . we prefer the service at the bar . bartenders are quick , efficient , and pleasant . bottom line - we stick to the bar , particularly for happy hour . cheap booze , tasty nibbles , and a great view of whatever game happens to be on their tv .		4		1
did the farm change names ? my last visit was in 2006 , but let me tell you , i can still taste those peaches ! i skipped on the peach-picking -lrb- the prices were a little high , as i recall -rrb- , and decided to have a peach pancake breakfast . i did n't think it special at all - the tiny peaches i managed to pluck when i passed a tree were sweeter and juicier than the ones served to me on the pancakes . others who were having pancakes seemed to enjoy themselves , though . i do recommend the peach sticky buns !!! i could n't decide whether or not i wanted to splurge on the pies as i could n't see myself purchasing one w/out sampling first , but they were flying off the shelves so fast , i decided to get one . however , it was too late ! my turn came up -lrb- long line -rrb- , and the last one was sold . btw , unless you like crowds and waiting in long lines , i suggest you go either before or after the peach festival . you can also purchase preserves , peach and non-peach varieties . i really liked the sweet potato butter .		4		1
when it comes to higher end quality pizza and pasta in town this is up there on my list . it 's mainly getting 4 stars for food quality and lack of wait time . unlike other well known pizzerias , my wait was just about 2 minutes . of course if i had opted to eat inside it would have been a bit longer but not by much . i chose the patio , completely shaded and equip with misters i did n't mind not being in the air conditioning . after looking at the menu for a good while , i decided to build my own pizza , choosing the wild mushrooms , locally made sausage , garlic and spinach . just having the option to personalize your pizza is nice . the crust is done well and not soggy . i also ordered up their house salad which comes dressed -lrb- while good in hind sight i would ask for it on the side -rrb- and especially loved the garbanzo bean garnish , such tasty morsels along with several other fresh ingredients . the worst thing about the parlor is the parking . they offer a complementary valet but it still ends up being a mess as these guys run all over trying to move and park cars while other people are also trying to find parking , which is limited .		4		1
a vegan diner ? go figure . my friends and i were looking for grub after a morning golf outing nearby at encanto . i knew bragg 's was nearby , but admittedly did n't know much about their menu . but since it was close we took a shot at it . the place is small but easily visible on the corner of grand & mckinley . the interior is pretty nonchalant and seats no more than probably 15-20 at a time . i had the french toast with citrus . it does n't look or taste like any french toast i 've had before , but was delicious . their hash browns were good too , though not as hearty as i expected . my friends had the biscuits and gravy as well as the scramble . again , totally vegan so no meat or byproducts in any of the dishes . they too were impressed . i knew this place used to be a pie factory so i decided to grab a slice . the apple cranberry sounded amazing , but sadly they ran out earlier that morning . so instead i had their strawberry cheesecake . again , its vegan so it did n't look or taste like any cheesecake i 've had before -lrb- the strawberries were actually in the batter instead of on top -rrb- , but once again a delicious surprise . they take a lot of pride in saying they locally source their ingredients and scratch make their dishes and it shows . the servers were incredibly friendly and helped explain the menu to everyone . my friends and i are carnivores , but even we liked the food . and if you 're vegan or vegetarian , you 'll go absolutely nuts for this place .		4		1
loud and crowded . but they did add some soundproofing material in the rafters , so it 's not so bad now . breakfast with the wife and kid on a lazy sunday . i had the cheddar-jalepeno biscuits and gravy . i usually have the wolf pack , but seeing the menu has grown substantially , thought i would try something new . the biscuits were delicious , a hint of cheesiness , with a bite of jalepeno , i could eat these delicious little disks all by themselves . the gravy was not so good . maybe the chef had a bad day , but back when i was an apprentice chef , my mentor would holler at me in his deep german voice , `` no dumplings ! '' whenever he saw me preparing a sauce . okay , so this is a gravy , prepared a bit differently , but the threat of dumplings is even worse . so , on this day , i had `` dumpling '' sausage gravy . the gravy was mildly flavored , and the sausage was just links that were cut in half lengthwise . it really was not that good , so i hope they work out the kinks on this recipe . i might be williing to trade tips on making a good sausage gravy : -- rrb - the daughter had the strawberry-topped waffle , and she loved the crispy waffle topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream . the wife had the same thing ! they both enjoyed this dish immensely , so much so , they would not let me taste it . iced tea was fresh , service was stellar , i 'd go back .		4		1
as a vegetarian and sporadic health nut , i just love tj 's . they have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce , including my beloved broccolini , for 40 % of what safeway charges . huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners , good for my on-the-go household . greek yogurt , cheap . nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine . i try to buy all my supplements here too , as they seem to be a lot less expensive . yes , i 'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot . the downside ? it 's not one-stop-shopping ; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a `` regular '' grocery store . this particular tj 's is teeny-tiny-small , and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons . my favorite is the woman who thinks it 's an awesome time to teach little jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop , and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly . i 'm all for giving your kid responsibility , but a -rrb- you still have to , you know , keep an eye on the kid and b -rrb- a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not , repeat , not the time to do so .		4		1
this review has been sitting incomplete for a couple months ... finally getting around to finishing it . bourbon steak is the type of place you go for a dining experience . bf and i went for restaurant week and probably enjoyed it that much more because of the great price . we sat at the bar while waiting for a table and enjoyed a couple drinks . the drink menu had a lot of classic , masculine-type drinks . my bf , who knows his wine , commented that the wine list seemed really marked up . the restaurant has a cool decor and excellent service ! we were brought a sampler of different flavored fries and dips which were so good -lrb- i have a weakness for french fries -rrb- . all the other food we ordered -lrb- soup , fish , dessert -rrb- was definitely above par . my boyfriend said his flat-iron kobe steak was good , but not the most outstanding steak he 's had . overall , i 'd recommend bourbon steak for a special occasion or to enjoy restaurant week/summer specials .		4		1
to set the record straight for all the pervs out there who thought i was checking in at a strip club tonight -lrb- it 's wednesday night for god 's sake and i have to work in the morning !!!! -rrb- , beaver choice is a tiny , very unassuming scandinavian / canadian restaurant in a strip mall in tempe . check out all of the awesome reviews to get an idea of how great this place is and then get in here . they serve a nice selection of scandinavian fish , meat and pork dishes . i started out with quebec-style poutine which was delicious -lrb- the canadians were n't pulling my leg on this -rrb- . the only thing that was missing was beer -lrb- they are byo fyi , so i 'll bring beer next time -rrb- . i 'm telling you folks , our evil socialist neighbors to the north know how to whip out some great comfort food !!!!! for my main i enjoyed some hearty swedish meatballs bathed in a hearty cream sauce and accompanied with tomato basil , spinach salad and sauteed green beans . you get a lot of food because your main comes with a side -lrb- choice of potato -rrb- and three types of salad . the salads are small but throw in three choices , your side and your main and you wind up with a lot of food . they have a nice selection of tasty looking pastries as well but you will be so full you 'll want to get your dessert to go . the family that run the place are so warm , hospitable , kind and welcoming and i 'm thrilled that they 're moving to a bigger location . this is a hidden gem in the valley and really and great option when you 're sick of all the usual choices to eat .		4		1
sweet basil , this place is good !! : -- rrb - i think that 's going to be my new `` catch phrase '' ... `` sweet basil '' , etc. : -rrb- if i want to add emphasis , i can insert an adjective ... `` sweet aromatic basil '' , etc. : -rrb- what do you think ? ... no ? ... ok : -rrb- but , maxim still has about the best vietnamese food around : -rrb- after a workout this morning -lrb- to nullify the effects of the uye at haus murphy 's last night -rrb- i met a bunch of my attorney buddies for a sort of healthy lunch today -lrb- btw , i realize , that sounds like an oxymoron ... `` attorney buddies '' , not `` healthy lunch '' : -rrb- they are a jolly crew ... always laughing and giggling about the misery visited upon the rest of society by the legal profession and its handmaidens , health care and insurance : -rrb- we laughed and talked and ate , ate and laughed ... soon , very soon , karma will pay a visit , but for now , they are jolly and entertaining lunch companions -lrb- not to mention invaluable resources for that inevitable day when my own legal misery strikes - : -rrb- maxim is more reliable than an attorneys billing logs -lrb- and significantly more tasty and less expensive : -rrb- i generally have # 20 , the rare beef pho with rice noodles , and a chicken spring roll ... hearty broth , real beef -lrb- not bits and pieces : -rrb- and plenty of it : -rrb- add your own heat -lrb- and there are plenty of options for that -rrb- as well as sprouts , basil , peppers , etc. , and you 've engineered a pretty decent lunch ... that does n't cause retox ... probably : -rrb- the service is always good here -lrb- insert legal joke about `` service '' here -rrb- ... and to top it off , the whole crew at maxim are just very nice people ... i think they are mostly family and they treat all of their customers great ! ... we were greeted with a smile and a smile and wave when we left : -- rrb - sweet basil , that 's good food : - -rrb-		4		1
good * little * spot for tasty burgers and tacos . i see lots of people checking in here all the time , and they 've got a solid four star rating , of course i wanted to check the place out . then deal chicken had a run on burgers apparently and were selling $ 20 to the stand for just $ 10 , so we bought it . i hate to waste a good deal , so we planned to visit for dinner one day , missed it and planned the next week , over and over . finally , we landed here for lunch on a random thursday . is it better than an in-n-out ? i do n't know , but it was pretty close in taste , and bigger in size . who does n't like bigger ? this is america , right ? everything was fresh , tasty , and i left feeling like i 'll be back at some point in the near -lrb- or distant -rrb- future - who knows . we tried a couple of the -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- short rib tacos , delish ' . a -lrb- $ 5.50 -rrb- burger with cheese , and we added -lrb- $ .75 -rrb- grilled jalapeños to it , also a great idea if you want to spice it up a bit . $ 2 will buy you an order of mexican corn , a -lrb- half -rrb- ear of corn covered with chipotle mayo , cheese , and chili powder . a reasonable sampling of their menu , and over all it was a great -lrb- unhealthy -rrb- meal . after ordering , we stood off to the side for a few minutes chatting while waiting for our order to be called , and waited , and waited some more . before i even realized we were n't getting our order , the lady behind the counter asked me what we had ordered , i guess she noticed us standing there , and everyone else getting their orders filled . i probably would have gone another 5 minutes or so before realizing . apparently the pos -lrb- point of sale -rrb- ; -- rrb - forgot to print out the order for the kitchen . great service , i thought . thanks for noticing ! my only issue with the stand is the extreme limited seating . during lunch , and i can only imagine i was not the only person annoyed with this , there was a consistent line of about 5 groups of people ordering food , with only 4 tables inside to sit . probably not a big deal eight months of the year , but august is definitely not one of those eight wonderful phoenix months . i am not about sitting outside on a patio during lunch , sweatin to the oldies , and then heading back to work , no thanks . adding insult to injury , there was a rather large group of people chatting away who were set up at three of the four inside tables that had finished their meal 20 + minutes ago , arghgghhg . that was not very considerate , considering the room full of people holding their trays of food fighting for a spot to eat . finally , the fourth table cleared out and we were able to snatch it up . i decided to sit on the same side of the booth as my wife , in case someone else wanted to sit on the other side ; i guess no one was outgoing enough to randomly join , but at least i tried . we ate our food , with a bit of small talk , wiped our table and went on our way . there were still 6 or so people aimlessly wandering around for a seat , and the moment we stood up someone else grabbed the booth ; all the while the one large group was still chatting away , drinking their soda 's , taking up three tables . i 'm not sure how off putting something like this would be to diners , but i 'd suggest trying out some friendly , non-threatening signage asking something like `` please consider diners waiting to enjoy this spot too '' to be put out during peak times ; like lunch on a thursday , and put away during other times . we enjoyed the food , enjoyed the service , but did n't enjoy getting cramped up into the little box of a dining room on a lunch break . i 'm guessing this is a much better drive through spot than dine in . happy yelping phoenix ! please , drive on through for your order . : - -rrb-		4		1
i 'm gon na take some heat for this , but i really do n't care . i love claim jumper . say what you will about chain this and chain that , but i hold this restaurant higher than your average chain and with reason . it takes everything bad about american dining - huge portions , over-the-top decor incl impressive old-school ceiling fans , fattening desserts and huge tedious menus and unabashedly flaunts it . i call it the sierra nevada version of cheesecake factory . i 've been going here for years - so i may be blinded by the nostalgia value , but i think the food is of better quality than your typical chain . i very rarely come here anymore because every location is far-flung since claim jumper is adored by suburban soccer parents from here to chicago , but my buddy out in south tempe got me to make the trek last week for his birthday . my favorites here are : * tri-tip french dip , which is delicious and classically californian . * rotisserie chicken with red skinned mashed potatoes or cheese potatocakes as an option . * country fried steak - with the mashed potatoes adorned with a red apple . : -rrb- * parmesan crusted chicken with angel hair marinara . * meatball calzone which is bigger than your face . if you can finish dinner here and leave room for the gluttonous chocolate mother lode cake or mud pie for dessert , i would like to meet you and shake your hand just to be sure you are human .		4		1
order the mac n cheese ! yummm , sam fox . thank you kind sir . yet another fine establishment from mr. fox . i went here for lunch with co-workers . they both ordered the chicken n brocholi and raved about it . i ordered the mac n cheese , naturally ... because i 'm the youngest in the crew . but the noodles are a funny teacup style . the make a funny noise if you stab them with your fork while they 're upside down . but in all seriousness , the sauce is so rich and creamy and really gives the cheddar a new flavor with the pamasean shreads on top . it 's heavenly . the only reason i gave sauce a 4 instead of a 5 was i was slightly -lrb- very slightly -rrb- disappointed in the interior . i have been to other fox establishments and the interior is something to marvel at , but sauce was just average . the picture do do it justice and it really is a more simple , easier fox concept . but for being in a strip mall and as delish as it is i wil overlook the simplicity of the decor . will go back !		4		1
we came here for a birthday celebration recently and had a great time ! over the past twenty-five years , we as a family have eaten in quite a few korean restaurants . chodang ranks up there with some of the best . yes , there was some unevenness with our service , but everything we ate was good . very good in fact . like good mexican restaurants , the outside can be deceiving . chodang does n't have a large presence on arizona avenue . in fact we drove past it , even with our car nav system telling us to stop . i have taken a picture of the signage and have posted it for easy reference . one difference with chodang , as compared with other korean restaurants is that they do all the cooking . so , if you are use to grilling your blugogie on the table stove , you can not do that here . but this is not a big deal , because they do a very nice job . btw , i would highly recommend the tofu dishes . it 's a house specialty . that 's because chodang 's is more of a tofu restaurant , then a bbq place as a meat lover , i was surprised at how delicious it was -lrb- see photo -rrb- . try the tofu soup with and egg on top , and remember it 's boiling hot !!! the kalgooksoo was good , too . another surprise at chodang was the beer . normally i always order ob , but instead tried hite for the first time it 's a lager , very much like asahi dry and very good . our bill for three came to $ 79.00 , including tip and taxes . that 's more than fair given all the delicious food we had . also , while you 're in the area , consider going to lee lee 's market . if only to look for some hite beer . enjoy !		4		1
very cool rooftop bar . phoenix actually looks like a city from up there . crazy . located off of the 3rd floor or so of the palomar hotel at cityscape , lustre overlooks the eastern part of the `` sports '' district downtown . there is a stairway up from the second level of cityscape , but its best to just enter the hotel and take the elevator up . theres plenty of comfy seating as well . we were here at night and it was gorgeous out , i cant imagine coming here during the day / early in the afternoon though . its just so exposed . that said , the drinks are great . i had a camellia cooler -lrb- they have it on tap -rrb- . it was very refreshing . the majority of the craft cocktails they offer are southwestern themed -lrb- or more specifically az themed -rrb- . im gon na have to come back and try the brass monkey . sunbru , oj , housemade curacuo , and orange bitters ? yes please . it was a great addition to our little downtown bar crawl .		4		1
i love non-chain restaurants to begin with , and this place exemplifies the attention to detail and wholly pulled-together ambiance that a great one-off place could be . i went with my dad , who was in town for the day . bonus points for having a few plasmas playing the ballgame , but not too many . classy and understated all the way . new mexico themed fare , whatever that is . it is basically a seafood/steakhouse with a bit of extra spicy kick to everything . i went with the pasta and grill , which consisted of a small medallion of steak , some chicken -lrb- with the added kick -rrb- and swordfish with a spicy chutney over the top . served over beans and rice , with half the plate offering up some pretty damned tasty penne . went great with a glass of wine , and not too much damage on the wallet . we got out of there for $ 60 plus a tip . one of my new favorites . interesting note ; my dad said if i did n't pull him in here , he would have `` driven right by the place and not even knew it was there '' . on the way out , a busboy stopped my dad and asked `` do i know you from somewhere ? '' my dad said he was the guy from the kyot voice overs , and gave his best `` kay-why-oooooh-teeeeee '' . nice .		4		1
second time trying out a restaurant at cityscape and first time at a fox concept restaurant . verdict : 4 stars . this is an upscale bar type of american restaurant that serves many dishes only found in upper end restaurants . a variety of cheese , fondue appetizers , excellent artichoke hummus , raw oysters , and main entrees ranging from jambalaya , short rib beef stew , sweet potato raviolis and cioppino specials . i personally did not order a main entree , but my friends did and they all looked amazing . i had their pastrami sandwich with handcut fries , which i thought was amazing from the sesame seed bun to the meat . blueberry cheesecake was good as well ! decor was modern and had all kinds of seating , anything from the bar to booths to regular tables . we had a very knowledgeable waiter as well and he sure knew how to upsell . it is a fairly pricey place , but you do get what you pay for . reservations are recommended , especially on a game night if you want a table .		4		1
my hubby and i have been fans of roy 's since our first time at the flagship location on oahu ... and we 've watched him expand to the mainland . our experience with the mainland roy 's have been hit and miss , but the marriott desert ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park ! we went at the tail end of arizona restaurant week . we really liked the menu options for this special week , and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world ... if that was the only thing that tasted good , then we would feel we got our money 's worth ... but we did n't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end . we had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills . she was unassuming and let us linger between courses . as i am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course , this was just perfect ! and so relaxing . the ambiance on the patio , which is where we chose to sit , almost felt as if we were on one of the islands , not in the middle of the desert ... with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort , it came pretty close ... it was just missing the trade winds . the resort had a band playing as well ... they were pretty good , a few ups and downs . i would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing ... oh , but i have digressed . my hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu . hubby had the grilled szechuan spiced pork ribs smoked & glazed in roy 's original mongolian sauce . a bit cliche , but they were finger lickin ' good ! my step-daughter and i shared the crispy spicy ahi sushi roll with ginger wasabi beurre blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal . the rolls were fresh , crunchy , and had a little kick ... not too spicy . it was a good thing i agreed to help her with it ! for entrees , my hubby had the roy 's original hawaiian blackened island ahi with spicy soy mustard butter sauce . it , too , was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it . my step-daughter had the roy 's roasted macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi with maine lobster essence . another nice portion of perfectly cooked mahi . we all were starting to feel the aloha spirit ... i had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all ... the hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish ... aah , what a delight , so melt-in-your-mouth delicate ... i was in island heaven . desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover . in fact , it tastes the same at every roy 's we 've been to ... it never disappoints . a total surprise ... and a delightful one ... was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet ... or did she say it was pineapple sorbet ... whatever ... it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake . we also ordered a bottle of newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it ... `` i know my wines ... '' having to always be the exception , i ordered the he original hawaiian martini , which was what i considered my dessert . it was a juicy combination of maui pineapple , vodka and coconut rummmmmm ! it was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish . you may be asking why i did n't give it five stars then if there were no misfires ... that five star is reserved for roy 's hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there !		4		1
there are so many reasons to dig kimpton 's firesky resort , i do n't know where to begin : let 's start at the front door . driving up , i felt like i reached a desert oasis built for the elite . the lush grounds are warm and inviting , and the lobby is something to marvel at . plan to hang out at the big community table , where they host nightly wine tastings and coffee and tea get togethers in the morning . the staff at the front desk was extremely helpful and they really made me feel welcome after a very late drive from tucson . my room was huge : fit for a king . there was plenty of space to spread out my clothing and work gear . the bathroom area was also spacious , the mini bar was stocked , and the modern conveniences like the flat screen tv , free wireless internet -lrb- for in touch members -rrb- and ipod docking station made it a super comfy home away from home . i 'm not really a `` froo-froo '' person when it comes to soaps and things , but it 's worth mentioning that the firesky is stocked with aveda body products , all the more reason to get dirty and get showered . the staff was truly interested in making my stay pleasurable . one morning when the gentleman at the front desk called with my wakeup call -lrb- yeah , real people call you , like in ye olden days ! -rrb- he asked me if i wanted to hear my horoscope . how cool ?! only thing that put out my fire a little ? i was a little weirded out that i had to drive to my room , as in , the rooms are separate from the lobby and reception area . at first it felt a little `` holiday inn '' to me , but after the first night i warmed up to the idea of being a little more removed and chocked it up to being a bit more private . all in all , the place sizzles , and i definitely recommend it for those who burn for a great stay in scottsdale .		4		1
mido sushi is great ! they have an excellent deal for happy hour , which is all day from monday-thursday , and from 11:30 -5 on friday and saturday . nigiri sushi and rolls are 1/2 price . the happy hour menu for sushi is pretty extensive , and a lot of specialty rolls are included . the rolls themselves are a large portion of fish and vegetable . the quality is pretty good , especially for the price . we ordered 6 different rolls and left very full . even the basic rolls such as tuna and salmon have a lot of fish in them and are pretty large , compared to other sushi restaurants where your basic rolls have a tiny amount of fish , and are pretty anemic looking compared to others . we had 2 deep fried rolls with jalapeno , and they were perfectly crispy , with a nice spicy kick to them from the fresh pepper . we also tried a deep-fried chicken roll since it sounded like a pretty unusual roll . it was also delicious , with panko-crusted chicken wrapped in rice and seaweed . the free salad , edamame , and miso soup is a nice beginning to your meal . service was cheerful and friendly . drinks were refilled promptly as needed . i 'd love to come here to try their $ 20 all-you-can-eat deal . one of these days i 'll head on over to pig out on their tasty sushi !		4		1
i was hekka hungry today and my friend suggested we go here . we rounded up the apartment troops and hopped in his hummer around 8pm . there was no wait and we were the last ones to come in just before closing . i was a bit worried since it was a party of 8 and it was so late but we basically ended up with the 2 servers to ourselves after the rest of the customers left . 99 cent margaritas all summer !! wth and they were not in miniature glasses either !! omg i saw customers with mi cheladas and other giant margs . their chips were fresh and hot not greasy or salty . the salsa could have used more bite to it but the kids enjoyed it as well as the bean dip that i could n't stop eating . my friends son had the waitress 's wrapped around his finger they were very attentive and kept stopping to get kisses from the little guy . the men had the carne asada plates that were ginormous and left nothing behind . i had the enchiladas suiza 's and my partner in crime had the fajitas . mine was good there wasnt really any heat to it but the chicken was cooked perfect . it was all really good i cant wait till i 'm hungry again for leftovers . the little ones had pizza 's and fries it kept them entertained and their meals included ice cream for dessert . i was really impressed by how nice the staff was way after closing time and they never made us feel like we needed to hurry . they made sure the margs were constantly flowing . the menu had everything but tamales i think . i will be going back to try this hibiscus infused marg it sounded delish !! party of 8 the bill came to $ 107 not bad at all ! p.s. . if you happen to like coronas they are $ 1.25 on tuesdays .		4		1
the average age of patrons at mary coyle is probably 63 , but it 's all good . i love old people . shoot my parents are old , my grandparents were old , and someday i will be too ! i mean , if anything , it should be a badge of honor for any ice cream parlor . old people know old-fashioned ice cream parlors , right ? no fooling them huh ? the ice cream here is rockin ! i mean 16 percent butterfat and made fresh on the premises daily ? how can that not be simultaneously sinful , decadent and to-die-for ? mary coyle was just what the doctor ordered when i returned from a 2 hour workout at the gym . haaah ! i decided to keep it sensible and choose a `` showboat '' -lrb- pippen - which is a small -rrb- , but could n't decide between one of the specialities with hot fudge or caramel . luckily the turtle and the hare featured both - glazed atop scoops of fresh butter pecan ice cream . service by the high-schooler staff was ok . the vertical striped -lrb- pink/white -rrb- wallpaper and norman rockwell prints were so hokey and authentic i wanted to gag and laugh at the same time . minuses : the 1950s feel here is authentic , but how can an old fashioned parlor not have a bar , and row of barstools ? -lrb- come on ... sugar bowl has a bar ! -rrb- also , they substituted pecans for peanuts on my ice cream . it 's ok . it happens . but i overheard at tables next to me that they ran out of marshmallows too . ok , i 'm no expert here , but those are ingredients that are readily available at your neighborhood fry 's . too much of a coincidence , and almost borderline lazy to not run out and replace immediately . disclosure : i must have been under the influence , because i am nearly always a gelato-only fool . but for some reason i wanted full-fat ice cream .		4		1
good food , great service , amazing view and ambiance visited for our annual family christmas eve dinner . the service crew quickly impressed with their speed and attentiveness . upon taking our seats , we were treated to a breathtaking panoramic view of phoenix as the sun set . if you want to shoot for that experience , take a 5:00 pm reservation in late-december . the designers of the restaurant did a wonderful job . it lends intimacy to the experience . dining options were worthy of the occasion -- breaded shrimp `` cocktail '' , french onion soup , wedge salads , steaks , fish , fresh rolls , and lava cake or red velvet cake dessert plates depending on the choices . not a single complaint -lrb- though i could n't finish the red velvet cake due to eating so much and its richness -rrb- . take a moment to get some pictures of your group on the balcony and to commiserate by the fire on a cool arizona winter 's night . afterward , if you have kids , go downstairs for christmas story time with cavalier spaniels , to take a picture with mrs. claus , and then listen to the professional carolers . self-parking is a breeze and the phoenician 's staff seems to always be exceptionally helpful and kind .		4		1
a little background ... my husband is from a sleepy community about an hour south of chicago . my husband could/would eat pizza everyday of his life if i permitted . when we went back to visit his parents he actually took me on a pizza tour of the area all of which ended with his absolute favorite pizza , aurelio 's . his love for this pizza stems from childhood and i honestly do not think you could convince him that there is a greater pizza out there . i even once looked into shipping aurelio 's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive . fast forward to this summer when i discovered a review on yelp that mentioned that there used to be an aurelio 's here in az that eventually became spinato 's . well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out . the sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in arizona to his beloved favorite . the crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled -lrb- or appears to be -rrb- . they are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day are n't too shabby . we have never had an issue with service or our order on the several occasions we have been one of my favorite things about spinato 's is the ice , seriously i have a passion for crushed ice and lots of it !		4		1
i was really on the fence if i should give this review 3 or 4 stars . stopped in yesterday for the s'mores milkshake . this was my first visit to beckett 's table and i 've been wanting to try it ever since i heard a review about their chocolate covered bacon ! the chocolate covered bacon is served as part of their s'mores dessert . for arizona dairy month they have made this dessert into a milkshake . the milkshake was tasty but just ok in my opinion . i think it had one or two too many flavors going on for my preference . it had the standard s'mores ingredients of marshmallow , chocolate , graham crackers and also had an addition of bacon , caramel and peanut butter . i think if the peanut butter had been left out it would have been way better ! -lrb- i like peanut butter but it just seemed to take away from the other delicious flavors instead of add to them . -rrb- the part of the shake i was looking forward to the most was the chocolate covered bacon ! sadly , the piece that came with the shake tasted burnt . -lrb- this coming from someone who likes their bacon very well done ! -rrb- but when we mentioned it to our server he was very nice and brought us out two more pieces of chocolate covered bacon to make up for it . and those ones tasted better . = -rrb- speaking of the service ... it was great . this is the reason for the 4 stars . the atmosphere is lovely . they are very attentive on filling up your water glass and making sure you enjoyed everything . it was great till the end , when we wanted to get our check ... which took a while . but i do n't hold that against them ... our server seemed to have too many tables to look after . i hope to stop in again to try their food when i have more time .		4		1
i love coming to this place with my wide range of friends . i usually go with `` my gays '' and enjoy copious amounts of martinis . this is my 3rd or 4th time going . i went with two of my friends for some appetizers and drinks this past friday and it was so yummy . we ordered the fries with the 3 dipping sauces , the galletes , and the bacon wrapped water chestnuts . everything was very good and provided a great base for the drinking that was going on . while the drinks were rather pricey , they were very good . you get about a drink and a half if you order a martini . my girlfriend and i ordered pomegranate martinis and they were just divine ! i loved that they were n't sweet and syrupy like i usually get . go there to get the night started with some yummy apps and great people watching . i do n't care if the men are gay or straight , they were hot and dressed fabulously ! ca n't wait to hit az88 again !		4		1
6:30 pm monday night , empty empty empty . but that did n't stop me from getting the most delicious crepes in town ! the hosts/owner ? was very friendly , had us sit anywhere we wanted . our waitress was super hot and nice ! later there was a couple more people that came in but i think that was it for the night since they close at 9 and it was about 8:30 pm when we left . anyways . . so we ordered the traditional flammenkuchen for the appetizer ... mmmm crispy tart crust with bacon , onions and melted swiss cheese . tasty ! i ordered the nordique crepe - - crepe filled with smoked salmon , melted swiss cheese and drizzled with lemon dill sauce . yummers ! and it came with a side green salad . = -rrb- although i have to say it was a bit on the salty side ... it was great but i think the smoked salmon was a bit salty . my bf ordered the savoyarde crepe - - filled with bacon , onions , sliced sauteed potatoes and melted raclette cheese . yummers ! this one is not as salty even though it 's loaded with bacon . we also had a side order of sweet potatoes fries , crispy and perfectly seasoned . = -rrb- unfortunately i was so stuff with the heavenly goodness of the savory crepes that i really did n't have room for dessert so my bf promised we would go back for the sweet crepes ^_^ . i ca n't wait to come back !		4		1
i love lola 's on central . great location that 's not too far away from the biltmore . unless it 's super packed at hula 's for some reason , you should always be able to find a space to park . there 's plenty of spaces to sit and work with their free wi-fi . i particularly liike working at the `` bar '' that overlooks central . their music is kind of hipster-y , which is appreciated in a coffee shop , especially if you 've spent too many days at starbucks like i have . however , the music is a little loud in case you want a quieter place to work out of . there 's also cute seating outside for a perfect weekend date coffee shop . the blanco is my favorite - sort of a white mocha concoction which i 'm sure is over anyone 's caloric intake for the morning , but a great drink nonetheless . they 've got a ton of pastries , but unfortunately gluten free goodies every now and then . if lola 's would offer that - it would be totally perfect !		4		1
i 'm a fan of nypd coz i think they have really good pizzas . i have a ny bias and altho there 's very few places that are able to come up with a true ny style pizza , nypd is close enough . there are four pizzas that i order at nypd and they are : pizza blanca , da works , joey 's favorite and cheese . i love their pizza blanca which is made with olive oil , crushed garlic , ricotta , mozzarella with your choice of spinach or roma tomatoes . * yum * i 've always liked it with spinach but i have to admit it 's exceptional with the tomatoes !! da works is their version of supreme , and their cheese reminds me of pizza by the slice at any pizza place in queens but not as good as the cheese at this pizza joint my family frequents in whitestone , ny . their strengths are their pizzas . avoid the calamari , it 's yuck and if you 've never had calamari this should not be the place to try it ... it 's gross ! their lasagna is not half bad , and their wings are good . overall , this is one of my go to places if i 'm craving pizza or buying takeout . it 's true nypd it 's your pizza i trust !		4		1
if you 're going for happy hour , get there on the earlier side of the time frame ... the bar fills up quickly and you can only get the specials at the bar . i have to say that this is one of my new favorite hh spots ! i went on a tuesday night and they have half off bottles of wine , all night . good thing since i needed something to wash down the delectable bacon wrapped scallops . the small plates deals during hh are great and such a great departure from the usual hh bites ... i do n't know about you but i 'm tired of fried things and bruschetta . how much bruschetta can phoenix handle ?! yet , i digress . the small plates , from $ 9 to $ 5 a plate ... such a good deal . we had the scallops i mentioned , really good scallops - worth the regular price of $ 9 . we also had the beef tenderloin/brie toasts , a little heavy on the brie , but the barkeep raved that they were the best thing he 's ever had ... -lrb- maybe he should try postino 's toast ? -rrb- stuffed mushrooms were good , the taco combo plate - great mexico city style tacos , and i 'm a huge critic of mexican food and these were actually very good . except 1 , 1 was a wee bit too spicy for me . and i love spicy . maybe it was the wine bringing out the tingling on my tongue ? we also got the oysters rokerij , similar to green mussels you would get at a sushi place ... very yummy . there were 3 in our party and we walked out of the place full and pleasantly toasty for $ 60 total - this is n't your chili 's hh but i 'm more than willing to spend $ 20 for the atmosphere , the drink , and the food . we will definitely be back .		4		1
for decor alone , culinary dropout gets 5 stars . lots of natural elements with sparkly chandeliers and a huge patio space with all of the aforementioned games . i really love that they paid homage to the auto-body or motorcycle shop that it was formerly on the sign out on the street . the open concept is fabulous . me and a girlfriend of mine came here for lunch last week and got there early as i 've heard from friends who work there and other people who have visited that there can be quite a wait both at lunch and at dinner which i totally understand as it 's a new spot in a great location . i 'm glad we did as there was little to no people there so we were able to get a seat quickly . we started out with the pretzel and provolone fondue ... yummy ! i totally indulged my inner fatty but we split it so i did n't feel quite as guilty . i ordered one of my favorite drinks to try at different places just to see how each place mixes it up -lrb- literally -rrb- , the moscow mule . it was pretty good ... not the best i 've had but it was good . after pigging out on pretzels , we both ordered the spring salad which we were told had just been added to the menu and that was the first time they were being debuted ; it consisted mainly of asparagus , beets , green beans , greens and a vinaigrette . the salad was tasty and light . . perfect for the warm weather . while we should have stopped there , we decided to get the salted caramel corn that came in a glass with caramel pudding i believe on the bottom layer . so good ! my sweet tooth was satisfied . i will say , it 's a pretty pricey lunch at $ 75 but i 'm definitely gon na come back on a sunday funday biking kind of day to check out the bar and the patio .		4		1
i swung by the roosevelt recently for the first time . i totally dug it . first of all , i love the little brick house . the structure , the exposed brick and the decor give it a great vibe . they had some great beer on tap - i tried the house brew which i believe is a four peaks ? it was great . then i struggled with my order . i need to try the grilled cheese and tomato soup as i 've heard such great things about it . instead i got the chorizo and manchego cheese over toast . not bad . i probably would have been in love with it if the toast were actually toasty . it seemed much more than toast . i also had the dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with parmigiano-reggiano . these were ridiculous . amazing flavors , rich , yummy . i 'd be ecstatic with a couple orders of these and the house beer . i definitely need to go back soon and try the grilled cheese and tomato soup and the pretzel as i 've heard so much about them . my first visit definitely made a fan of me though and i will be happy to head back as soon as possible .		4		1
wow it really took me this long to actually try liberty market , really !?!?!? what was i thinking ! i have been missing out on this place for way too long . and to find it now , just when my company is moving and it was sooo close !!!! ok , sorry enough of my whining ! this place is just wow ! the food looked amazing ; the dessert looked way too good ! and the taste did not disappoint either . my friend and i went to lunch today at liberty market , i was at first surprised by the line to order , it was long ! but the way they seat people is really ingenious ; by the time you are done ordering you have a table waiting . pretty cool ! we ordered the picnic sandwich , which was very flavorful . my favorite part was the crisp green apples , which added great texture . a little blue cheese , some turkey , it was really well put together . we also ordered the white pizza , which was very tasty ! the crust was nice and crispy and the pine nuts were an excellent addition . oh and do n't forget dessert , no i really mean it , do n't forget dessert ... well i guess you can if you are on a diet or something . we had the red velvet cake , yum ! i think liberty market really has taken the cafeteria style dining and made it a well-organized machine ; i am so impressed by this place . what took me so long to get here , i ask myself again !		4		1
mr. m and i saw lyle lovett and his large band last night in the ikeda theater and in spite of the woman next to me talking loudly throughout the show and wearing 14 gallons of an awful perfume -- i do n't have a sensitive sniffer so if it irritates my sinuses , it should probably have a hazmat sticker on it . in spite of the couple in front of us in the balcony who violated every rule of concert etiquette you can think of , including : hanging over the edge of the balcony and blocking our view with the cowboy hat perched on the mr. 's empty noggin and talking on the phone during the show . they leaned so far over the balcony rail that i was sure i 'd see at least the hat take a dive , and maybe even darwin 's law get enacted , and dipshit mcdoucherson would go on over after it ... but ... no that did n't happen . that would be sad for the innocent victims that moron would have landed on . there is something seriously wrong with some people . and in spite of the fact that it was kind of warm in the theater -- hey it 's august in the desert ... the entire evening i never really felt that nice refreshing chill of a/c . ... the concert was amazing . lyle and his band were phenomenal . the amount of talent on that stage ... well , i 'm so glad we went . the sound in the ikeda theater just blows me away . i 'm still trying to figure out where i really like to sit so i 'll keep trying other areas . # 12 , seats 1 and 2 in the balcony were not great for us , but i knew going in it was limited visibility . i just did n't think i would have an idiot hanging over the railing in front of us . where was the usher ? they are all over the place , and last night i noticed they were so absorbed in the concert the ones around me really were n't paying attention to the patrons and their shenanigans . if you have n't been here yet you really need to check their schedule and go . like i said , the sound is amazing in this beautiful theater , it 's easy to get up and down to the different levels , there are plenty of bathrooms , and walking out after the show is so pleasant . this complex is beautifully designed .		4		1
contrary to everyone else , we really enjoyed our free movie experience . super friendly grand opening staff ... almost bordering on disney-esque enthusiasm . hope the energy stays on ! we definitely would come here again , larger seating , quieter atmosphere due to 18 + age group , and decent dining without scary airport-like pricing -lrb- entrees $ 8.99-12 .99 -rrb- ... food quality is applebee 's level , so set expectations accordingly ... chicken tenders - run of the mill normal strips , no hint of coconut but there was the odd ponzu sauce . battered shrimp - received 7 large tender -lrb- not overcooked -rrb- shrimp , better but the ponzu sauce is corn syrup scary . allowed me to sub the typical fries for a small side salad -lrb- romaine -rrb- . chicken fried steak - ok , came w / hearty portion of mashed red potatoes and snap peas . smokey salmon sandwich - would order this again , came with chips triple berry stack - unmemorable chocolate brownie and ice cream - warm and delicious		4		1
i love this place . i have n't experienced the server issues that some other people have been posting about - maybe i 'm just lucky ? if you 're a microbrew fan , always check the chalkboard where they post their seasonals . you ca n't go wrong w / the light rail cream ale , the hef , or the vanilla porter . i absolutely loved their pilsner when they had that on tap . their food is pretty good , but i would n't really classify this as a dining destination - this place is about the beer . i was disappointed in the kobe burger , and i would n't order it again . the brat was just ok . onion rings were so good but i would n't get them again because i 'm pretty sure they are 1 million calories each and they gave me like 6 huge ones ! the mac & cheese is so good . salads are nice & fresh , the baja shrimp tacos really kick butt . i also like the ambiance of the place . cool setup in the brewers ' den and the funky patio in between the brewers den and the main bar area . for giggles do n't forget to check out the murals on the patio wall and also on the back wall of the parking area .		4		1
absolutely love love love their all-day happy hour every sunday ! the bucatini and meatballs at $ 5 is an absolute steal - i highly recommend doing a double order and calling it dinner ! the noodles are homemade and delectably thick and chewy , the red sauce is fresh , and the small meatballs are moist and delicious ! we started tonight with the grilled artichoke , which was extremely tasty but highly overpriced at $ 12 for a single small/medium sized artichoke . we also ordered the arancini , which was oozing with cheesy goodness and comes three to an order . during happy hour , the arancini is $ 5 an order , which is totally reasonable for the size of the app ; regular price is about double . i ordered the braised short rib and ricotta gnocchi , which was beautifully presented and nicely cooked , but it was bland and lacked seasoning . the bombolini dessert was a lovely end to a great meal - four cinnamon sugar covered `` beignets '' on a bed of real vanilla mascarpone and meyer lemon curd . the service was amazing and the food was great ! the only downfalls were the intense number of flying insects invading our table space and the co-ed bathrooms . i 'm all for social progress but there 's a good reason men and women have maintained separate bathrooms throughout history , and it has nothing to do with gender segregation . it 's just that guys always pee all over the toilet seats ... overall , it was another great dining experience , brought to you courtesy of fox restaurant concepts , and we will definitely be taking advantage of this happy hour again in the near future !		4		1
this is a neighborhood place for me , within easy walking distance . at one time or another , somebody in my family has tried just about everything they have to offer . if you can walk here , good for you , if you have to park , good luck . you can * usually * get into the parking lot during the week and on non-holiday weekends . sometimes if you come early , you can get right in . the pizza is awesome . the gladiator is my favorite , hands down , although all that meat tends to get a little salty . the avocado pizza is a favorite with the wife and kids . the sourdough crust is thin and crispy , yet still chewy enough to let you know it 's there . there is definitely better pizza around , but not in the neighborhood . when lgo first opened , i had a burger and swore i 'd never get a burger anywhere else . that was then . today , i would n't take the burger if they offered it free . the current version is an insult to burgers everywhere -lrb- including fast food burgers -rrb- - i can only hope they get off the corporate cost-cutting bandwagon and start offering a decent hand-formed burger again - remember , the grind is just down the street and deluxe is not too far for a way better burger experience . the wings , on the other hand , are my current favorite . big , meaty , dripping with a spicy-sweet , smoky and savory sauce that is truly finger-licking good . a few lonely sticks of celery with a blue-cheese dip accompany it . some time ago , they started offering draft beer in a `` growler '' , basically a jug-o-beer . if you are not driving , get one of these , some wings , and sit on the patio and just watch the show around you . it 's a great way to ease into the weekend after a tough day at work . for breakfast , head over to the grocery for a commuter sandwich . hands down an awesome sandwich on a giant fresh-baked english muffin . coffee is so-so , and it is definitely the neighborly thing to take the paper and the pups down on saturday morning to enjoy the beautiful weather , while enjoying a cuppa and a commuter . the grocery is full of kitschy things , most overpriced but definitely interesting . overall , it 's nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood .		4		1
a brave scholar once said , `` there is no such thing as bad pizza . some are better and some are worse . but pizza , ahh , pizza is amore '' . when i first met z , that 's what i call her . just z . she seemed so familiar . she smelled familiar . looked familiar . better yet . she tasted familiar . whether a whole pie , in all it 's tomato sauce glory , delivered to my front door . or two tangy , cheesy -lrb- award winning wisconsin cheese mind you ... which is cool ... but is the cheese awards part of the upcoming awards season ? and if so , what will i wear to the red , er , um would it be yellow carpet ? not sure -rrb- tempting and tantalizing triangles that i eat in with a cold stella artois for a mere $ 7.25 . service is friendly . the cute , arty dining room cozy , airy and light . kinda like a breezy , california dining room . california ? hey , that 's it . z pizza . dee lish . inovative . fresh . california . laguna beach . bingo . i had my first z experience , i was d-zeed shall we say , after a dance a thon at the boom boom room in laguna beach in the late 80s . nice to see you z. glad we can hang once again !		4		1
this place stinks of fish , which is something i always like to mention for those who have a strong sense of smell , like i do . beyond that , i love it here ! on weekends , it 's impossible to find a time that is n't ridiculously packed and busy . yesterday -lrb- sunday -rrb- , they actually ran out of ice for drinks for a brief period !! i really enjoy the sushi here and could just eat that all night . there is a nice assortment of chinese food items , mongolian-style barbecue and seafood delights , like crab legs and frog legs . the desserts are great ; the best is the variety of ice creams ! the service was fine for a buffet . the table was kept clean and the drinks kept full . i 've brought many special guests here . $ 41 for three people to eat an enormous sunday dinner with drinks ... not bad at all ! if they could do something to counteract that terrible fishy smell , i 'd give this place 5 stars . ; -rrb- they also offer take-out prices by the pound !		4		1
i go to this location quite often . it is near my house and i do n't like to waste gas if i can help it . it is easy to pull into with 2 entrance and exits , one on 7th ave and one on indian school . the store is clean and well put together like the others . true that there is not very much in the for sale section but , i think it is a busy location so maybe that is why . they have a security guard there and yes they need one . it attracts a lot of criminal types . sometimes the people that work there are nice and helpful , like at present , but other times they have really had some wicked ones working there . i had bought some british cookies once that were on sale and i told the guy i was over charged . he fixed it on the register and then threw the cookies down the conveyor belt . i noticed he is no longer there . -lrb- no i did not report that . -rrb- he just seemed angry all the time . there was an older woman there too that was pretty angry with life . have n't seen her in awhile either . but , it is clean , the food is fresh . but i do wish they had more organic and more british things . i like it , but they do n't give you money off for bringing your own bag and you ca n't use coupons except for theirs .		4		1
monkey pants , the pants , m pizzy ... call it what you will , but monkey pants is and will always be one of my favorite bars in tempe . i love this place because it 's a bar that reminds its customers that they can let loose and not take themselves so seriously . customers are also kindly reminded that they can receive a free shot just for showing off a little skin during the 1 o'clock shirtless shot ! it 's nonsense like this that made me a regular here , and it 's nonsense like this that will always encourage me to bring my friends here for a good time . the pants is n't all about wackiness though , they take a few things seriously , like their food . a lot of the menu is typical bar fare , but there are a few things that stand out . in an attempt to cater to the influx of new-to-town transplants , they have burgers named by their state of influence . i definitely nod in the direction of the new mexico , the arizona and the georgia burgers . they are all amazing , and if you 're feeling silly , go for the alaskan burger ... that 's sure to make your server -lrb- or chris the bartender -rrb- chuckle . next up , the pants ' ranch . they seriously need to bottle that and sell it . that ranch is the tastiest that i 've ever had , and when paired with the fries , it 's what the french would call , `` bueno ! '' ... or something like that . the ranch can also be paired with some pretty delicious hot wings as well . if you decide to go with those , get them charred on the grill with extra sauce ! in my opinion , any night is a good night for m pizzy . but , if i had to choose a couple to recommend , they would be wednesday for wig wednesday -lrb- happy hour prices from 8pm until close if you wear a wig ... which are provided ... and $ 2 off burgers -rrb- and thursday -lrb- $ 5 hot dog special , live comedy and goldfish races after 10pm -rrb- . monkey pants is a happening spot ; go and get yo ass in the pants !		4		1
my girlfriends and i started a dinner club and zinburger was the first selection . i enjoyed it ! i had a difficult time deciding between burgers -lrb- the homemade veggie burger with tomato marmalade - which i 'm obsessed with right now - sounded so good -rrb- . i was very hungry , so i decided i needed some beef . i ordered the zinburger well done -lrb- yes , i like my hamburger meat practically burned and yes , i know carcinogens are bad -rrb- . the burger comes topped with manchego cheese and wine braised onions . i nixed the mayo and added avocado . i ate every last bite of the buger -lrb- except for the slice of avocado that shot out of the burger and across the table - oops -rrb- . we all shared sweet potato fries and truffle fries , which were both very good ! i personally did n't prefer their dipping sauces ... yogurt -lrb- tzaziki style -rrb- and truffle aioli -lrb- seemed more like plain mayonaise -rrb- . our waitress was excellent ! very attentive and informative about the food options . i 'd like to go back and try more !		4		1
great place for happy hour ! the food is great as well as the drinks . my girlfriend had the ` fire and ice ' and she loved it . they had oak creek hefeweizen on tap which is one of my favorites , and hard to find . i was very excited about that . this place seems fairly new , but the atomsphere is classy/casual -lrb- well at the hour that we went -rrb- , and pretty laid back . the servers were great , friendly , and knowledgable . although this place is new , they seemed to have great reccomendations and suggestions on waht was popular off the menu . we snacked a bit and mainly were there for drinks . the hummus was probably one of the best hummus dishes we had ever had . i highly reccomend getting that plate . also , the drinks are out of this world . the martinis are also on happy hour and are so eclectic and unique . lots of different flavor twists . it was so hard for my girlfriend to even make a decision , she ended up getting two different ones ! her friend got the pear tini with st. germaine in it and she also got the berry mojito . they all had no complaints . i stuck with the oak creek hefeweizen , which was great on draft as always , but they also have a nut brown ale and beer from four peaks , a local brewery . all in all a great place . the layout is spacious and inviting and the tip i have is to go to the back of the restaurant . when you walk in , head straight for the back wall , you will see a circular bar and a circular wall with tables along it , that area also is open for happy hour . it is less crowded , a little quieter , has tv 's and is perfect to beat the crowd !! enjoy !		4		1
i rarely make the trip through the construction riddened camelback road and congested central avenue ; but when i do make the trip , it 's worth it ! although the entrance of this place is on the opposite side of the bakery , my nose always finds it first ! i do n't know if it 's the oh so purdy danishes and treats or the if it 's the smell of all these things baking !! hmmmmmmmmmm ... either way , i ca n't leave without a cream puff the size of my fist ! i always look at the deli but nothing has ever jumped out at me . i love the cheese section ! i want to sample and buy everything !! i 've had caught myself daydreaming on how i could possibly steal one of the large wheels of real parmesano . the wheels are still turning on that one ! but alas , i have n't the balls to pull of that great caper . but i do have the balls to talk a little shop with the butchers who are always helpful and pretty funny once you repeat that one joke from the chris farley classic black sheep . i am always tempted to ditch the puff for a well marbled ribeye steak . however , my limited funds usually keeps me faithful to my sweet cream puff ! onwards i go to the italian `` shoppe '' that does n't really speak to me . i 've had it and i totally did n't write home about it . but the produce !! oh my gosh !! my head whirls and spins about all the possiblities when i browse through the produce section . the organics that will spoil the second i bring it home ... the tried and true pure produce that is bright and fragrant and in a good way ! unlike some of the stuff that can be found in the more run down food citys in this town . i really like being inspired by food to make even better food . and quality really plays a huge role in inspirational food . so go , and press your nose up on the bakery 's glass display case showcasing it 's decident sweet goods and dont ' shoplift any cheese ! talk shop with the butchers and be inspired by all the products in the store . even chat up an employee or two , inspiration loves company ! have fun , take your time and do n't forget you wallet !!		4		1
the mccormick-stillman railroad park and model railroad building offers an inexpensive fun day for both children and adults alike ! we came here yesterday to enjoy a cool day in the park , along with seeing the progress of the modelers efforts . i have taken several pictures of their o , ho and n gauge layouts which are absolutely beautiful . it 's hard to appreciate their scale and hard work from the photos , because the layouts are so massive in size and scope . we are guessing they are 30 or 40 feet in length and 20 feet wide for each of the three model scales . that 's huge and must be one of the largest in the united states if combined ! admission to the model railroad building and park are free , and is open 363 days a year . tickets for the various rides cost $ 1.00 each . children under the age of three are free on the train and carousel with a paying adult . children under the age of 13 are free in the historical railroad exhibit . enjoy !		4		1
first of all , any place that sells cherry coke out of the fountain gets an automatic 4 stars from me at the very least . i do n't care if you do n't like it , that 's just how it is . i was really nervous about going to this place after the smashburger disaster . the smashburger disaster of course was when me and the rest of tempe getting super excited that a supposedly legit burger place was coming to downtown tempe , then i got there , and it was horrific . a patty and bun essentially served in a pool of grease , horribly over-seasoned fries , and a stomach ache that ruined my afternoon . needless to say , i was a little hesitant to get my hopes up for a new over-hyped burger chain near my office . that said , i was actually pleasantly surprised with five guys when i went there for lunch today . yes , like a moron , i went there on their very first day open , always a dangerous move mind you , so of course it was slammed . however , the place was very well staffed and they handled the crowd no problem . basically the deal is you get hamburgers , cheeseburgers , or bacon burgers , one or two patties , and a large selection of toppings , all which are free of charge . you also can either get regular fries or cajun style fries . the burger was juicy and flavorful . the cherry coke was as magical as you 'd imagine , and the cajun fries honestly kind of sucked . no real flavor to them and they were a little limp but boy did they give you a ton of them . luckily for them , i was still mesmerized by that heavenly cherry coke , but i digress ... five guys is by no means gourmet or fine-dining , but it is a very welcome addition to my dt tempe lunching routine .		4		1
ya know , i really like this place . they have enough varieties of tea that i could come here 70 more times and never duplicate . that makes for great selection , but also almost a good five minutes for me to settle on one . i would have liked it a little more if it were n't for the teeny-bopper staff . for some reason i did n't have the most confidence that they could steer me to a savory selection to my liking . one of them did get me a sample of one of the featured iced teas of the day without me even asking , which was nice . i ended up with a small pot of pomegranate black tea , which yields you 2 cups . my friend ordered a round , chocolate decadent dessert which i sampled and it was delish ! they have pots , mugs , filters , and other fun tea accessories . i 'm glad to see a shop entirely devoted to tea since i drink more of that than coffee and tea shops are hard to come by . i 'll definitely be back to try another tasty tea and probably another dessert too ...		4		1
i prefer this location over the one at the biltmore . why ? the place is smaller so your server is less likely to forget about you , and people watching is way more fun in scottsdale . happy hour here is amazing . my fiance and i can get away with stuffing our faces for under $ 20 if we do n't buy any drinks . hh is from 3-7 , but i would recommend coming in before 5 to beat the crowds coming in after work . i try to avoid this place when it gets busy because the seating is really cramped ! also , for parents , there is no room for strollers here and there are no changing tables . i think places like this have a little baby discrimination ... people sometimes glare at us when we walk in with our child -lrb- even when he 's being super quiet -rrb- . i guess sushi is too cool for babies . my suggestion is to bring the little one in the carseat because he/she will fit just fine in a booth or on the chairs on the patio and go when it 's not crowded !		4		1
ah the marquee how i do enjoy this venue ! i 'm not going to bitch about how i have to take my shoes off like so many people , get over it . it takes 2 seconds . this medium sized venue is perfect when you want to see a band you really enjoy in more or less in an intimate setting . what i mean by that is that this venue is not too big nor is it too small . it 's just the right size and no matter where you are inside you have a good standing position -lrb- no seats inside -rrb- . what makes or breaks this place is the sound . if the sound guy is doing the correct mix , the acoustics in here are pretty damn solid . if the mix is bad , it 's definitely going to put a damper on your night . the inside is nothing special . it 's pretty much 4 walls with a stage , and a big stage at that . i have never had a bad experience here and i actually really do enjoy attending shows here . i ca n't wait for the next one !!		4		1
a big thank you to brad , who invited me to try over-easy out again after my lackluster experience a few weeks back . i love to see yelp reuniting restaurants and patrons , creating harmony in the food world , once again . our service was about 1000x better on this visit . our server was thoughtful , attentive , and made sure that we were well taken care of . our meals were delicious . none of the average food that we found last time ... perhaps due to an increased sense about their strengths . just stick to what they are best at , and you 'll be a happy camper . i ordered the chicken and waffle . the waffle could have been a little crisper , but the flavor was perfect . the chicken was expertly seasoned , and the combination was only elevated by a large splash of hot sauce and lots of maple syrup . of course , you must be a fan of the sweet/spicy/savory combination to appreciate this dish . my friend had a breakfast burrito that looked delicious , but i was actually more impressed with the side dish of fruit . no silly bowl of melon here - just bright , fresh berries . mmm ! definitely an upgrade from typical fruit garnishes . i am still sad that there are so many tables , and a lack of defined space ... but the improved food and service from my last visit definitely warrants a +2 star improvement . over easy , we can still be friends : -rrb-		4		1
i 'm going to go out on a limb , and say that this is the best spot in phoenix to grab a beer . as a beer lover , there is no other establishment that i have found that has the selection and knowledge of papago brewing co. . so the food sucks , there is no patio , and the restaurant is sub par . the beer is great . they are n't trying to be anything besides the spot to grab whatever beer you possibly desire . cruise the circle-k style cases for a fresh bottle , or order up one of their ever changing drafts . the biggest advice i can give for the papago brew co is to talk to their staff . tell them what you like , what you do n't like and have them make a selection . there are very few people that i have met that are more in tuned with beer . enjoy this establishment , but do n't expect anything more than what it is . if you go in expecting to drink a few beers , you will enjoy , but if you go in expecting anything more than that , forget it and go somewhere else .		4		1
movies + beer = natural . i 've been dying to check out this place since the loft in tucson has left me craving a local independent theater where i do n't have to sneak in my booze to enjoy my film -lrb- wassup harkins cupz -rrb- . the concept excited me beyond measure . the sprawling lounge is decorated vaguely moroccan with lanterns , upholstered benches affixed to the wall , dim lighting and a small bar pretty much fully stocked . i was able with my yelp check in to get a discount on the tickets and loved getting my boddingtons in a nice glass to take with me . the bartenders/ticketmasters were very personable and helpful and def charming . i was honestly surprised by how small the theater actually is , but the seats are supremely comfortable - the cup holders are a bit awkward since glass pint glasses were n't the intended usage , but meh , i managed . the sound was fantastic and the screen high quality - i like the option of the back round tables in case you had a group of friends or food you wanted to munch on while watching the flick . the audience was all over the map and totally excited to be there , which helped with the vibe of the experience . i know some people have mentioned that is a great place to hang out without even seeing a movie . i have to admit i found it disconcerting to find people at the bar a little beyond drunk just hanging out and not even intending to see the movie when i stepped out to refresh my beverage . i guess if you live near by it makes sense , but to just be intoxicated here without seeing the movie is weird and kind of creepy . the bathrooms were nice and overall i totally enjoyed my experience here . i also liked they can combine the tab of the movie and the beers , makes it much easier to settle up at the end of the night . recommended !		4		1
was at this bar once before when it was called j chew way back when but was so drunk i couldnt yelp that night if i tried . noticed another name change and decided to stumble in here on a wednesday night after work . there were just several patrons at the bar so it was really chill . all friendly too . some live acoustic guitar for us which was nice -lrb- jeordie -rrb- and they usually have live music going on every night . stopped by saturday night as well with a friend . larger crowd on the weekend obviously but still a great atmosphere . they have a full bar . no draft beer tho which i would like but whatever . not sure about any happy hour deals , but i work too late to find out . i do love the layout of this place . small but very open . patio is great . bartenders are awesome , very friendly ! -lrb- shout out to holly ! -rrb- overall ott is a great place to get hammered and/or relax . and will be trying to get back there again sooner rather than later !		4		1
not gon na bother writing a super long and descriptive review with almost 200 reviews before me . bottom line i liked this place , i will come back for sure ! was told multiple times that i needed to come here and finally did . had the pork sandwich on the brunch menu and it was really good . the only problem i had with the place was our server was just a little weird , not rude or anything , she just would comment on things that she thought we were looking at on the menu and just kept walking by with her input , but not a big deal . and then not like this place could help it but i was really bothered by the other patrons there , the tables are close so i guess you can hear other people more than you would want to but some of these people were just real stuck up . being at a trendy place does n't make you super cool , so just chilax and have a good time or go home . but yeah , not like they could do anything about it , but if your thinking about going and your a snooty brat , just do n't .		4		1
terry t and i were planning on biking for our places to participate in the dueling chefs for brunch , this past sunday . unfortunately , when i was trying to fill my front bike tire with air , i broke off the stem . so i had to drive , which puts me in a cranky mood . doubly unfortunate , chef chris bevington was n't able to make the event due to an injury . terry ordered the tea smoked chicken omelet which comes with a side of cubed melon . she said the chicken was very flavorful ; however , for $ 14 she thought the portions were a bit lean . i ordered the japanese breakfast that came with choice of meat -lsb- grilled mackerel , saikyo miso black cod or pork cutlet -- i let chef nobuo decide , and he selected the mackerel which was awesome ! -rsb- , house-made tofu , spinach balls , miso soup and rice . at $ 18 , this was a pretty good deal because of the wonderful variety . i ca n't wait for another dueling brunch so i can sample even more .		4		1
green chili pulled pork sandwich was great , smoked tomato bisque was amazing . after siracha closed we gangplankers have been waiting for something to open up in that space for a while . now we have vintage 95 . decor is really nice ... very wine bar-ish . thick wood tables and chairs and textiles all around and dimly lit old historical looking pendants hanging above the bar . place feels comfy . outdoor patio still exists w / fire pit and umbrellas for the day time . they 're working on a side patio too but that 's still a ways off from opening as per construction . staff was very friendly and all smiles - service was attentive and accurate . manager/owner came over to see how the food was about mid lunch . food ... we were in for lunch and 3 of us got the pulled pork with green chili 's as mentioned at the beginning and a cup of the smoked tomato bisque w / what tasted like breaded grilled cheese in it ... i 'd eat that stuff all day every day if i could . pulled pork sandwich tasted really good , bread got a little heavy half way through for me but i ate out the meat and chilis to finish it off . one friend is a vegetarian and got a veggie panini and commented on how good it was and also loved the tomato soup . another friend had the vintage flatbread , and did n't enjoy it . was overwhelmed with the pickled onions and candied dates that made it too sweet to eat all of it . drink ... only went there for lunch so i ca n't comment on that yet . dessert ... we did n't order anything but looked at the offerings . we were kind wondering why there was no chocolate on there seeing as we were in a wine bar ... there was one with nutella sauce ??? that 's kind of not really what we expected but ... anyways heads up . we 'll all be back to try other things ... and to see what they have for happy hour too . cheers		4		1
for many years , dilly 's was my saving grace for a lunchtime option when i worked in tempe . although i could never escape the smell of fresh bread for the rest of the day , the quality of sandwich was worth the smell . dilly 's is a great deli if you need to get in and out in a timely manner while still being able to enjoy a decent meal along the way . whether it 's their salads or sandwiches , i am a fan of whatever they serve . do n't get me started on the sugar cookies . those little bits of baking delight probably cost me a pound or two , but it was worth every bite . any deli that serves fresh avocado gets a star in my book and not only does dilly 's serve it , they pile it on . the bread is always fresh -lrb- hence the smell -rrb- and the sandwiches are served with just the right amount of warmth to them . if you visit , here are my top choices : - if you like cream cheese and avocado , go with the dilly bird - veggie supreme but add turkey - honey do if you are a fan of honey mustard - greek wrap - clam chowder enjoy !		4		1
i had been wanting to see a show here for a while now and just never found the chance until the other day . i had heard flip orley , comedian and hypnotist , on kupd while getting ready for work , talking about his show at tempe improv . with nothing scheduled for the evening i thought i would give ti a try . i rolled solo to this event and was not sure what to expect . it turns out they serve full dinners if you choose or you can hang out up in the balcony and wait to be seated once the general admission hours start . i chose to eat dinner and be seated . they sat me at a table with 3 very nice people right up next to the stage . the food was better than expected -lrb- i had the taco salad -rrb- although the service was a bit off . i volunteered to go up on stage for the show and ended up being one of 8 or so that he hypnotized . there was no barking like a dog or clucking like a chicken . it was all good fun . tempe improv exceeded my expectations , i got good food , a couple of drinks and quality entertainment for about $ 50 -lrb- yes included the ticket price -rrb- .		4		1
on a strip of bars catering to a college-age crowd , this modern american beer garden with a large patio that is friendly to both dog and bike , offers a fantastic selection of draft beers ranging from austrian to belgian to arizonan . this is also one of the only places in the valley , that i have discovered , that offers beer cocktails . try the signature handlebar shandy with stiegl goldbrau lager , san pellegrino limonata , agave nectar , and a sprig of rosemary to top it off . for $ 6 this is an outstanding value . the space itself is open and inviting , combining rustic wooden table and bartops , exposed brick on walls and ceilings , and a lot of natural light coming in from the centerpiece of the room - the bar - which is 60 feet long and has both indoor and outdoor seating . the food here is made to order in the cozy little grilling area situated in the corner of the bar . keep this in mind when coming here on a busy night - you might wait a while for your food . but luckily the menu is simple and consists of local gourmet bratwurst , polish sausage , italian , and a smoked turkey sausage . for $ 5 you can select up two toppings such as sauerkraut or pickled fresno peppers . for sides you have the option of regular or sweet potato hand cut fries , and for $ 3 with a dipping sauce of your choice they are unbeatable . highly recommend the decadent bleu cheese bacon dip ! it also tastes amazing on the burger as well as the brat . the kitchen is open late night for food , which beats getting a pizza or taco on mill after a night of carousing . weekly events are scrabble nights on mondays , ladie 's night on tuesdays , trivia night on wednesdays great neighborhood bar , great place to stop in for lunch or a late night bite , great place for beers !		4		1
i do n't have any beef with carly 's like most downtown do , but if you do n't get to this place on the right night -- that is not too crowded on ff or not too sparse on most other nights -- than you certainly will have some . sure , the service is spotty , but i think it comes off as amiable rather than hoity . its staff , mostly herbal-crunchy women likely daydreaming about vegetables , is sweet and in their defense , are pretty hamstrung by their duties of preparing the food , attending to the tables , and bartending . my only qualm with carly 's is the fact that they often run out of my favorite things like the organic sammy smith , which they never seem to have anymore , but here 's big love to the fact that they now serve austin 's own tito 's handmade vodka . do yourself a favor and try this out if you are a vodka fan -- its made of yellow corn and is distilled six times ... it also won the double gold medal at the world 's spirits competition beating out over 70 other high-end vodkas and won the only four-star ranking that year .		4		1
union makes me think of an upscale flea market . is that weird ? meh , to each their own . it 's a great addition to this mall , i think it needed a little `` hip '' flare . this is it ! there are a lot of hipsters and great locally owned shops , locally owned is what makes it what it is . a bunch of upscale boutiques put under one roof ? genius . the bike store has to be my favorite . everything is on the more expensive side , but you have to somewhat expect that at the biltmore mall right ? there are great places with knick-knacks for your home , also pricy . but it 's super fun to walk through and if anything you can pick up some inspiration . there is a restaurant that i can not remember the name for the life of me , but it 's a little cafe at the very end of the `` strip '' . i have gone twice on saturday afternoon 's and it 's never overly crowded , or crowded at all . that is not to say that their food and drinks are not delicious . because they are . : -rrb- i 've had the mimosa and the caesar salad , both were great ! caesar salad was very crunchy which is my favorite , i hate when it 's soggy . i definitely like union and will be back , i especially like that i can park for free for the first two hours . if i go over that it 's because i 've had too many cocktails .		4		1
04/21/10 met up w / a friend for coffee and a pastry . well , i had coffee and a pastry ; i think she had a pizza . loved the cafe latte ! i do n't really care for too much foam , and this cup was absolutely perfect ! i usually order coffee w/out sugar so that i may also enjoy a sweet complement . today 's pairing was a cherry scone . the piece i tried had a pleasing-to-the-eye golden color to it , as well as a few lovely-looking cherries . wished there were more in the batter -- those cherries you see on the edges were pretty much the only ones i had -lrb- the middle was almost void of any ! -rrb- . i originally had turned down the accompanying homemade whipped cream -lrb- sweetened w / powdered sugar -rrb- , but the scone was , as is usually par for the course , a bit dry -lrb- do n't forget sorely lacking enough cherries ! -rrb- and needed something extra . if you 're ever offered their homemade whipped cream , you better ask for extra -- it 's wonderful ! i may not get another scone , but i 'll definitely be back for more coffee !		4		1
10/01 had dinner with a group of yelp friends . thanks to jim w. for organizing yet another fun event ! the weather was perfect and made for a relaxing dinner out in the patio . for dinner , i ordered the krakauer wurst , a spicy beef and pork sausage with a crispy sausage casing -lrb- `` spicy '' and `` crispy '' were the keywords in my choosing this dish ! -rrb- platter , which included german fried potatoes , sauerkraut , and a bowl of chicken and cabbage soup -lrb- $ 9.95 -rrb- . i would order this dish again ! loved the spiciness and textures of the sausage -lrb- would i be able to enjoy trying out the other non-spicy dishes if i decide not to order the krakauer on my next visit ?? -rrb- , and the fried potatoes were very good - of course , i only ate the crispiest of the bunch . i 've been avoiding cabbage for many months now , but after sampling a taste of it tonight , i had to have more : -rrb- i did n't taste the soup - that came home with me for my roomie to enjoy - but a few others received it with their meals , and the aroma was intoxicating ! btw , i was also handed some horseradish on the side as part of the platter , but the sausage was spicy enough that i did n't need it . for dessert , i ordered a slice of the german chocolate cake -lrb- $ 6.95 ? -rrb- - four layers of cake iced with homemade whip cream , cherry jam with cherries , and almond slivers coating one side . a dollop of fresh whip cream placed beside it just added a little more sweetness to this lovely meal 's end . i would also order this confection again = -rrb- i almost forgot ! haus murphy was gracious enough to offer two complimentary pretzels for the table . while i had only a couple of small twists , i really enjoyed them ! i will surely order this on my next visit !		4		1
the type of cuisine at carlsbad is officially considered ` green hash chile new mexican style . ' i know this because we asked the bartender as we sat pondering the menu . this was my first visit to carlsbad tavern , and it will not be my last . i went with a house salad and will agree with rick s in recommending it with their jalapeno ranch dressing . either it was really good or i was really hungry , but i digress ! for my entree , the lobster enchiladas were completely satisfying - especially once they brought out a side of guacamole per my request . jared had the carne adovada plate . -lrb- i guess he gets that every f-in time he goes there ; i do n't think he 's ever had anything else ! guess he likes it ! -rrb- no desserts or drinks this visit , but i 'm sure we 'll be back for more ... although the mints on the way out were great ! -lrb- and for those curious about the price , our bill was $ 36 before tip -rrb- . we noticed they serve a sunday brunch - bloody mary bar as well ... sounds good to me ; especially once we move to old town and wo n't have to worry about drinking and driving ! friendly attentive service at the bar , and many more menu items i am excited to try . until next visit , carlsbad tavern ...		4		1
-lrb- lyrics - kelis - milkshake -rrb- fox concept brings all of us to the yard , and they 're like it 's tastier than before , damn right it 's tastier than before , you can dine here , but they have to charge fox concept brings all of us to the yard , and they 're like it 's tastier than before , damn right it 's tastier than before , you can dine here , but they have to charge i know you want it , the thing that makes you hungry , what all of us go crazy for . they lose their minds , the way we dine , i think its time la la-la la la , warm it up . lala-lalala , we 're all waiting the yard is an interesting place . two different dining experiences ; one from what i gather a seafood/oyster restaurant and the other is the culinary dropout . culinary dropout i would describe is modern american cuisine . great small bites to share so we ordered the pretzel with cheese , bacon with grilled cheese and the mussels . the pretzels were soft and doughy while the creamy cheese helped with the chewing process , if you know what i mean . the bacon and grilled cheese sandwich really worked well together . that 's gon na be my new thing grilled cheese and bacon ; why did n't i think of this ! finally , the mussels with the broth , which i still ca n't figure what it is ... yummy ! overall my favorite of the night and definitely a recommendation . drinks are pretty pricey , and the games around `` the yard '' are pretty cool . ping pong tables , foosball , and corn hole games spread across the place . it reminds me of an east coast roof top bar feel with the couches and the live band rocking away . it can get real loud here , but if you ca n't handle the noise keep your butt at home and enjoy a glass of wine . in the end , this is the closet thing to a night life in central area of phoenix . - enjoy !		4		1
i 'm here almost every weekend , stocking up on arrowhead water , artisanal cheeses , kirkland multi-purpose no-rub contact lens solutions , awesome gift certificates , coach 's special oatmeal , biodegradeable lavender-scented clothing detergents , and those rotisserie chickens my mom loves so much ! once in awhile , i lose my sunglasses , so i replace them w / a quick stop at the optical . do n't let the employees talk you into thinking costco does n't re-pack and sell previously-used items . i 've assembled a shoe-tree that had scuffmarks , opened up 42-inch hdtvs w / footstands already bolted -lrb- usually they come unattached -rrb- , and even pulled out a charger , w / what looked like dried-up baby-milk vomit on it , from a sealed gps system package ! but , you 've got to embrace the bad w / the good , right ? so far , the good outweigh the bad . attention directv customers : should you need more than the one complimentary hd dvr you get at sign-up , you may purchase extra sets here for $ 30 less each than buying directly . if you 're looking for new wireless phones and services , stop at the wireless kiosk and have a look around . i wish there were more options to choose from -lrb- usually one phone model per carrier . boo ! -rrb- , but at least when you do find one you like , you wo n't have to pay extra for a travel charger or a phone case .		4		1
went yesterday with my wife and daughter for a big lunch . when we go for a big lunch , we normally order a lot and pig-out so that we do n't have to make dinner that night . been a fan of tao garden for a long , long time -- maybe 10 + years . go to sit down and eat , and we get take-out a lot . generally speaking , we are not disappointed . we know what is good on their menu and what is not-so-good . so we stick to what we like . yesterday was no exception , we ordered a lot and everything was good . the service was good and we talked with the husband/wife owners again . they are also nice and their lead waitress is an old-timer who is friendly and knowledgeable . she speaks english well , but know chinese and all the chinese dishes well . we order two noodles -lrb- my wife and daughter like noodles -rrb- . we had gong lo mein with extra beansprouts and chicken and gailan -lrb- chinese brocolli-hong kong style -rrb- . we also had steamed chicken with spicy oil and chili dipping sauce , deep friend stuffed tofu , chinese beef stew with beef tendons . all very , very good . perhaps not the very best cantonese food we have had , but still very good , especially for the phoenix area where the restaurants have to cater to the clientele 's tastes and likes . i really do n't understand why other people do n't go here more often . maybe the chinese buffets , even with pretty crappy food , still draw the crowds due to the cheap prices .		4		1
9/29 oh yeah , i 'll be back ! so what if this place was practically dead when i arrived at 4:30 pm ? and so what if it took me two times to ask for some table bread , which did n't arrive till after i 'd placed my 2nd appetizer order ? or that the glass of primitivo mediterranean red was a bit disappointing ? oh , no . i was captivated after my first bite of the asparagus bruschetta ! by the second bite , i was knee-deep in quicksand and succumbing to sweet surrender . sweet , roasted red pepper surrender . on a bed of creamy , luscious , and lust-provoking goat cheese . i was so transported by this dish that i was n't satisfied with just one ... no , no . i had to have another ! and yes , if you must know , i ate it all = -rrb- oh , and the table bread ? i sampled a thumb-twist of the honey-whole wheat , and it , too , was delicious . i took the rest home , and i 'm unhappy to say that not a crumb of it was present 24 hours later -lrb- no thanks to my roomie -rrb- .		4		1
i really do n't understand the mixed reviews of this place ! we stopped in tonight and had a great experience . we started out with a couple orders of hamachi sushi that were some of the freshest that we 've had in quite awhile . the sushi chef was a very entertaining and funny man , he even pointed out , much to my husband 's dismay , that the kirin ichiban beer that he was drinking -lrb- and loves -rrb- is actually made in the u.s. by anheuser-busch ... needless to say , he will never order that beer again ! we than moved on to the spicy tuna roll , which is made just with sriracha and does n't have any mayonnaise to mask the flavor of the fish . we had a few more orders of hamachi and then ordered the `` snow white '' roll , -lrb- a daily special -rrb- which was the spicy tuna roll with white tuna on top and garnished with a dab of sriracha on top . it was excellent ! we then asked the sushi chef for his recommendation and he made us an order of albacore tuna sushi with a miso mustard sauce on it . what an incredible presentation ! we immediately ordered another order . overall , the cuts of sushi were very meaty and everything was incredibly fresh . the atmosphere was slightly lacking , but the sushi chef -lrb- owner -rrb- told us that he was in the process of ramping up and had already ordered a large fish tank to go on one wall and was planning to re-do the paper lanterns with hanging lights . he also told us that he 's been in the u.s. for 18 years now and finally has his own restaurant after starting out as a dish washer -lrb- kudos to him ! -rrb- and that he ca n't believe how his competitors will serve day old fish . i think we 've found our new north scottsdale go-to sushi place !		4		1
scottsdale quarter is a great place to hang out even if you only window shop and skip out on the expensive restaurants . i usually have my little one in tow with me so i come here to get some fresh air . first off , hey mommys out there , this place has 2 amazing family restrooms ! both are equipped with a nursing area with low lighting , changing station and separate toilet . they are always clean , so it 's actually a pleasant experience if you have to change a diaper etc. . i find the fountain area to be peaceful and like to watch the kiddos running around in the water . if your looking for a less expensive place to eat here try out the new c3 kitchen . i have grabbed lunch here many times for around $ 8 . my favorite restaurant here has to be true food kitchen and press for coffee . i agree that the parking is awful , but i 'm the sort who will drive around until i find a spot , which is probably a complete waste of time because they have 2 parking garages , but i do it anyways .		4		1
tried smashburger for the first time a few weeks ago . i have to say that i really enjoyed it . i ordered the arizona burger -lrb- chipotle mayo , habenero cheese , jalapenos , guac , lettuce , tomato -rrb- and sweet potato fries . the burger was spicy which i loved . the burger patty had alot of flavor which was surprising because i always thought that smashing a burger makes the juices and flavor run out . this was not the case . the sweet potato fries were really good and i liked that they put rosemary and oil on those . the sweet potato fries were a great compliment to the spicy burger . the hubby had the mushroom swiss burger with smash fries . he enjoyed both as well . decor was cool and the service was fine . the only complaint i have is the price . it was 21.00 for my husbands 1/2 pound burger , my 1/3 pound burger , and the two orders of fries . its actually cheaper to go to fuddruckers and we get more food from fuddys as well . i will say though that smash burger was mighty tasty so i would still go back .		4		1
after opening all our gifts and eating a big christmas lunch the family decided they wanted some dinner . well , we did n't have much left in the way of leftovers , and since we were at my mom 's , there was n't much to chose from otherwise in the fridge -lrb- she is a minimalist when it comes to food -rrb- . my dad had been having a hankering for some fried rice for the past few weeks , which worked out since it seems the only restaurants that are open on christmas are chinese ! nee house is near my folks , so we called up and placed an order to go . we were told that it would be 45 minutes to an hour until it was ready ... yikes ! my dad and my sister left to go pick it up after about 40 minutes ... and they were gone for a really , really long time ! i guess the place was a madhouse , and if you wanted a table you had to wait in a line for a table ! they sat at the bar and waited ... and finally after sitting there about 45 minutes they finally got the food -lrb- note to self : never try to order chinese food on christmas again ! -rrb- . when they got home we were all hoping that the food would make up for the wait ... and well , it did ! we got the hot & sour soup as well as the war wonton , both were excellent , although the hot & sour could have used a bit more heat . the house fried rice was awesome , cooked perfectly , with lots of meat and it was n't greasy at all , which is very unusual for fried rice . we also got mu shu pork -lrb- this was the best i have ever had -rrb- and some sesame chicken . it was breaded , but it was n't greasy at all , and the sauce was just sweet enough , but not overpowering . we had ordered some crab puffs , and they were good , but they had forgotten to give us the dipping sauce , which would have made them that much better . overall , except for the long wait , we found nee house to be really good . my dad brought home a menu for us to look at , and it has one of the most expansive menus i have ever seen at a chinese restaurant , including a lot of seafood dishes . my dad was happy to have gotten his fried rice fix ... and i have a feeling he will be going back again soon .		4		1
i have been back to the cafe several times since my last review -lrb- the place is right next to my house ! -rrb- , and i must say , i like this place ... a lot . i have tried their lentil soup -lrb- very good sweet to savory ratio with the coconut milk -rrb- , rotisserie chicken -lrb- very moist -rrb- , sweet potato -lrb- cooked well , did n't love the butter -rrb- , french silk pie -lrb- ohhhh soooo chocolatey and rich ... definitely my fave dessert here -rrb- , the blondie -lrb- a little too sweet , but the bf likes it -rrb- , and the chocolate stout cake -lrb- this is actually one i did n't like ... the cake is kind of dry and the frosting is too buttery ... not my fave -rrb- . also , i went to the elite event here and sampled some delicious food , but i noticed the wonderful porcetta sandwich we got to try is n't on their menu ! that needs to be added stat ! we also got to try a delicious ice cream sandwich with corn cookies , which tasted like harder and sweeter cornbreads ... it was pretty bomb . further , i tried their farmer 's cup drink -lrb- several times even :-p -rrb- and it is one of the most delicious drinks i have had in a long time ... i love that it is both a little fresh from the cucumber , sweet from the lemonade , and spicy from the basil and pepper . i 'll definitely be back -lrb- in fact , planning on going tonight for happy hour , which is 3 to close all summer ... awesome ! -rrb- . ps they have a special right now where you can get any sandwich and a beer for 8 $ on nights when there are d backs home games ... pretty sweet deal .		4		1
`` beer is proof that god loves man , and wants him to be happy '' - benjamin franklin . i 'm not personally religious . . spiritual maybe ? but if there is a higher power i would add that beer and mexican food is the proof . for me this is the ultimate in comfort food . there is nothing that a cheesy greasy plate of mexican food cant fix ... or at least soften the blow . over the past months i have subjected myself to countless mediocre mexican experiences . my favorite senoran mexican place for years has been carlos o'briens . i know there has to be somewhere out there as good or better . so far its been a disappointing adventure , i have found a few places that had single better items . finally i feel as if all these wasted calories finally paid off . los compadres . . you have given me hope that i will find what i 'm looking for . i walked out of there stuffed , with money left in my wallet , and a big smile on my face . with a few small improvements you would be my new favorite mexican place . chips/salsa : the salsa was great . . it was a slightly chunkier version of the taco sauce you usually get in the squeeze bottles . the chips were crisp , thin , and lite . . although i find it hard to explain why they seemed lite when they were a bit on the oily side but somehow they were . salted well but not overly . well worth the $ 1 or whatever it was . drain them a tad more and you would have perfect chips . cheese crisp : i ca n't believe i am saying this but i think i have found my new favorite cheese crisp . it was the perfect crispy yet pliable texture . so freaking good i 'm not even sure i put salsa on more then a few bites of it . the cheese was amazing . . i think there was butter involved here somewhere . i want one now !!! guac : again . . shocked to say this . . but tied with my current favorite . not a a tomato to be found . the perfect balance of avocado , garlic , cilantro , peppers for heat , citrus . beef tamale : not a star . . with all the great food here i would not waste the stomach space . shredded beef taco : although we all enjoyed them their are better tacos in the valley . one disappointing note was that right out of the kitchen every taco on the whole table was split down the middle from taco fail . it happens . . i got over it . saving grace was that they were stuffed then fried . . mmmmmm extra grease :d enchilada : delicious ! the corn tortilla was not overpowering with corn flavor . the red sauce here is rich , thick , creamy , and smokey . if they were to salamander the enchiladas with the cheese on them before serving it would kick the ass of every other enchilada i 've had in town . since they use foam plates they ca n't do this . relleno : finally ! this is probably the best senoran style relleno i 've had outside of mexico . i was n't even a huge fan of the beef green chili on top and it was still amazing . next time i will order it with the red enchilada sauce for what i 'm sure will be the ultimate relleno . . unless you feel like taking a trip to the friendly dolphin in rocky point . carne asada : chris ordered a carne asada burrito . this is not something i usually get unless i 'm making it myself or at a * ertos . he offered me a taste . . whoa ! delicious . the marinade on this was amazing . there was a hint of something sweet . . i would guess it had some orange juice or orange slices in the marinade . rice : if i had to pick one thing that they absolutely need to improve on its the rice . although the rice was cooked perfectly . the grains stayed intact and there was no mushiness to it at all . the flavor was just off and not great in general . as weird as it sounds the first few bites i had almost tasted floral . i think they could easily improve on this . this is a really important one guys ! fixy please ! beans : polar opposite of the rice . i 'm not even a huge bean fan and these were great . creamy , salty , rich , and definitely had some delicious lard in there . its no wonder its mentioned again and again in the reviews . pros : amazing combo prices ! parking lot -lrb- this can be important in this part of town -rrb- plenty of tables quick service freaking delicious cons : rice taco fail tamale my perfect return trip meal : carne asada chili relleno -lrb- substitue green chili for red enchilada sauce -rrb- enchilada cheese crisp + guac		4		1
last night ... i was exhausted . i get off of work at 11pm . i wanted to eat good food and drink good wine past 11pm . on a wednesday . not too far away from where i live in tempe . oh ... and i was hoping to have it be semi-romantic . kazimierz . it was time to finally visit the holy grail of yummy wine olive flatbread goodness . i figured a wednesday would mean no reservations necessary and we would miss the dinner crowd . finding kazimierz is definitely a fun part of the excursion-i had the phoenix native drive while i vainly tried to figure out where it was . i knew there were no signs , but for some reason i pictured hobbit doors with green gabled entranceways and hidden paths . well . it is ina strip mall-but damn , they try hard to make you forget . guessing by the stained glass windows , we went around the corner and followed the signs that led us into a low-ceilinged , warm , rosy place ... not quite the warm , casion , cave like atmosphere of chez nous , more of a speak-easy . there were sofas near the entrance and i checked a menu on a table to make sure we were in the right place -lrb- i did n't want to stumble in a cult recruitment/steakhouse or something , you know ? -rrb- and the friendly shaggy haired bartender told us to sit where ever we wanted . at 11:45 pm , there were a good ten people at the long bar to the left . sofas , chairs , ottomans , all different sizes and configurations were the dominant structure of the large room that opened to the right-but were all occupied . we wandered towards the stain-glassed windows and i hate sitting at tall tables , so we went for a cozy two person table with a small antique round table . this is the kind of place you want to bring people to-far more impressed than i was with postinos . the menu is cheese and bread focused . goat cheese salad , foccaccia with summer vegetables , antipasto , a variety of flatbreads with morels , crayfish , tomatoes and many kinds of cheese . cheese platters abound ! the wine book is over-whelming , but i love getting red wine flights . i went for the moderately priced 19 one and was blown away by one , please by another , and enjoyed the other robust taste . it was paired with the biggest plate of olives i have ever seen served-i normally devour those suckers and at the end of our stay there was still at least 20 olives left . they were tasty , but i prefer having olives herbed . we went for the flatbreads for optimum sharing . the tuscany was simple , buffalo mozzarella , tomato , it was simple and clean . despite lactose intolerance , i am a sucker for truffle oil and went for the burgundian-brie with morels , brie and truffle oil . people-they do not skimp on the brie . i may have woken up crying with lactaid pills clutched in my hands , but damn if i still did n't eat the last deathly bite-that is how good it was ! now ... why one less star ? why throw off the curve ? well , the hip young staff must have been psyched for a slow weeknight ... b/c , guys , they were playing art brut . look it up . a shaggy , garage band that screams modern art makes me wan na rock out . wtf ? i mean , i saw them live ... moshing and dancing with sweaty dudes . not really wine and olives music . the music continued in this vein all night . kinda threw off the ambiance . and while i loved the food , i would have liked more non-bread options , like seafood , risotto , something like that . i have to compare to tapino 's , and tapino 's wins on the food variety ... and ambiance . i definitely will continue to haunt this place late at night .		4		1
great shopping . even better people watching ! here you can shop stores ranging from h & m and pac sun , to prada , gucci , and louis vuitton . it 's a pretty upscale mall , so most shoppers dress to impress , while other people recognize the fact that it is still just a mall , so they do n't . that being said , you 'll never feel out of place , no matter what you show up wearing . i love the valet area the most ... it 's littered with tricked out bentleys , lambos , ferraris , and aston martins ! i mean , i drive a really nice car , and i would still be ashamed to valet it there ! my favorite store is probably lush ! i have a tendency to spend a lot of money in that store !! sephora is a close second ... i 'm always on the lookout for my next favorite cologne ! fashion square also boasts some pretty good dining as well ! modern steak , albeit very pricey serves up a damn good slab of steak . on my next visit i 'd like to try the kobe beef hot dog !! z tejas , kona grill , and the yard house all offer great happy hour and reverse happy hour deals on food and beverages ! all in all , this mall is impeccably clean , very inviting , and fun to shop !		4		1
bungalow how i love thee . this was one of the first restaurants i discovered in phoenix when i first moved here and i 've kept a close relationship ever sense . bungalow gives you the impression that you 're eating on the waterfront of san diego or lake tahoe . if you close your eyes and bypass the car noise , you 'll see what i 'm talking about . as one of the best outdoor eateries in old town , there food is top notch bar and grill dining as well . have you ever tried a fried avocado ? it might sound scary but it 's anything but tasty . bungalow offers an amazing hh special on drinks and appetizers but even during regular hours , the prices are reasonable . day or night , hungry or thirsty , bungalow is a great spot to relax with friends when the weather 's nice . menu suggestions : burger or sliders - yum . chicken sandwich - topped with fried avocados , you have to try it . the french fries are tasty give the artichoke dip a chance . it comes with soft bread and melts in your mouth . the wraps are tasty as well . if the weather is nice , be sure to secure an outdoor spot early or else you 'll be waiting awhile to experience the outdoor gem of old town .		4		1
full ... so ... full !! it was over 36 hours ago that i had famous dave 's bbq ... and i 'm still full !! i was frustrated with my so-called-friends of my so-called-life ! and i decided to seek a nice evening instead a drama-filled night of pulling chinese fire drills on the southside of town . so i hollared at the sis and consulted yelp to see where a great bbq place is ... dave 's was at the top of the list . after hours and hours of texting - we were set ! we got there on a friday evening at around 7pm or so and there were several parties ahead of us , naturally . we were told it was a 25 minute wait . so we went outside to play with my new camera . not even 15 minutes later - we were called to out table . yay ! we sat down and i immediately started the bbq sauce taste test ! pouring them onto what was apparently where our used bones go . -lrb- ew -rrb- we tasted each kind and chose our favorites . their sweet & zesty and rich & sassy -lrb- is that right ? -rrb- sauces were my faves . i could n't hang with the geogria mustard sauce nor could i take the devil 's spit . i looove hot food , but i was n't feeling the sauce . the texas pit was crazy-awesome ! but it just did n't mesh well with the flavor of the bbq . i was lobbying for the feast the entire way there !! and yesss ... the sis and cousin agreed !! i had to ask the intertribal table battle cry ... are you hungry ... or are you starving ?!?! the answer is always starving !! haha !! while an entire chicken , a whole slab of pork ribs and half a briskit were being prepared along with our corn on the cob , cole slaw , beans , french fries & corn bread muffins ... we dined on fried catfish . seriously - i did n't dig it . i think it was the flavor of the fish itself but the sauce it came with tasted pretty rad especially when mixed with the texas pit sauce ! : -rrb- and then ... the feast arrived ! served on a trash can lid ... that i 'm praying has atleast been hosed off before hitting our table ! :p it was huge , it was beautiful ! :d i 'm sooo glad we ordered it ! we each grabbed our tong -lrb- it came with three -rrb- and we just dug in ! i had two plates of food and i was stuffed ! i was in hog heaven !! i had several ribs and the best briskit i ever had !! the meat was perfect - the biggest letdowns was in the side dishes . the corn was obviously frozen at one time - but still good . the beans were oniony -lrb- i do n't like onions -rrb- so i did n't dig 'em . the fries were very salty ... but still good . i wish we could have had more cornbread muffins . but i must say - the cole slaw was probably the best i have ever had ! crazy yummy ! at the end of the meal - we could n't hang . there was a huge amount of chicken left and and a few ribs and a ton of fries and we did n't even touch the beans . we took home two to-go boxes and still left some food on the our trusty trash can lid . we got to the car , to-go boxes in hand and i just wanted to lower the seat and just sleep ! it was so good !! i will definatly be back ! it was crazy yummy . there were serious smoke rings in their ribs ! their sauces were tasty and had zing to spare ! their prices were a lil high . -lrb- nearly $ 60 for the feast ! -rrb- but it was worth every penny !! i am such a fan , i can not imagine ever venturing into chandler mall 's food court again with famous dave 's being just a few steps away !		4		1
filipino food just like my sister makes ! ok , she 's my sister-in-law -lrb- you can clearly see i 'm not filipino -rrb- , but the food is just like her authentic dishes . check iain b. 's review for detail on typical filipino fare . i am particularly fond of the pork adobo , beef machada and pancit . the adobe is an intensely seasoned beef that i like to mixed into the pancit - a delectable blend of rice noodles and veggies which is made to order with chicken or tofu -lrb- yum -rrb- as requested . the beef machada , a heavily seasoned thick stew of tender beef and potatoes is equally captivating . the restaurant is very casual , with only a few tables , yet the decor rises above the typical mexcian food takeout shop . oh yes , the mexican fusion part ... i admit the only `` fusion '' item i 've tried is a pork adobo burrito , which was quite tasty . but with all this great filipino fare , the mexican side has n't tempted me much . the only very slight disappointment is that in response to a customer complaining that the lumpia is to greasy , they changed from pork lumpia to ground beef . of course pork is greasy - it 's pork ! that 's why it 's good ! anyway , there is enough tasty fare here to keep me coming back . the pleasant service and heartfelt appreciation of their customer rounds out out the experience . here 's a hint - leftover pork adobo and pancit are just as good reheated for breakfast as they are in the restaurant .		4		1
i got ta tell you - for a bachelorette party , this is the place to go . my bf 's bachelorette party was held here after dinner and , at first , i was a little bit worried i 'd experience the same crap as axis/radius for my last friend 's bachelorette party -lrb- i was hard of hearing for the next full day and the crowd was so lame , i just wanted to sit on the side and count how many girls looked like ` ladies of the night ' -rrb- but to my pleasant surprise , this place totally impressed me ! here is why : disclaimer : i am a happily married straight gal , love to dance techno 1 - the crowd was 80 % gay men , which was perfect since it meant i was n't going to get dumb guys trying to hit on me -lrb- hello ! do n't you see my shiny ring and the fact that i 'm not dressed like a ` lady of the night ' trying to get your attention -rrb- or trying to literally pull me away from my friends to dance -lrb- freak -rrb- with them . 2 - the gals that were there were gay/tran/etc and not the prostitute-looking , dumb ` barely dressed ' broads -lrb- as typical of lots of scottsdale clubs -rrb- you have to deal with that take up room on the dance floor and are n't even dancing -lrb- they 're just standing there trying to look hot -rrb- . 3 - the bartender dudes were awesome - friendly , generous with the many shots we bought and i never had to ` wait ' for the bartender or try to get his attention - they were very attentive and actually friendly ! also , their drinks were strong ! not watered down . 4 - the atmosphere is fun - the place is a bit dark and dive-y looking inside -lrb- and out -rrb- , but once you get the music going and the crowd thickens up , it is fun ! also , a major thing to me - the music was perfectly amplified such that my ears were not ringing even though i was on the dance floor all night . also the club patrons were not like the a/r patrons . . friendlier , fun to dance with , cuter boys ! also , since it was a bachelorette party , a lot of the gay men there were kind enough to buy the bride plenty of drinks and even take her out for plenty of dancing . 5 - the owner came by and offered our bride-to-be an oh-so-sexy dance with 2 of the better looking go-go dancer dudes -lrb- i thought that was cool of the owner to set up -rrb- . i do n't even club but i 'd say that if i am ever invited to go clubbing again in scottsdale , i am all for visiting this gay club ! the only down sides : the bathroom line was rediculously long . . outdoor ` patio ' is kinda slummy .		4		1
i normally would not hesitate to give a place two or one stars for very bad service problems since i was a certified restaurant trainer for some time . the dark haired youthful looking line cook made up for all the problems we had and went beyond all jobs he had to do and was a saving grace and deserves to be recognized and made our visit worth going back for . i do note the waitress was n't at any fault at all since she was clearly over loaded with responsibilities including seating people while she was over loaded . to keep it as short as possible . we ordered , drinks that almost did n't come out meals were run out while after sitting under heat lamp by line cook one meal came out one undercooked so we had to run one back to kitchen , and the line cook ran the meal to me . i am touched and i need to say in general the food in the end was very solid . the dinner items seem to have a little more wow factor but what we had was good and better than what you get at most places . i hope they get space heaters for next winter because it was a chilly maybe 43 degrees in the dining room just like outside was on sunday .		4		1
my fiance and i are huge fans of mexican food and there 's rarely a time that we 're not in the mood to eat it . when a friend told me they served a speciality frozen horchata drink , i knew we had to check it out . the frozen horchata is served as a cocktail , and you have the option of getting it with either rum or vodka . we opted to try both , and they were amazing ! i definitely preferred the drink with vodka since it did n't take away from the flavor of the horchata like the rum did . after finishing his drink , my fiance ordered a jamaica margarita with chili on the rim . i had a couple sips of it and it might have been better than the horchata ! chips and salsa can really make or break a mexican place for me , so i really appreciated that their chips were hot and salty while the salsas -lrb- red and green -rrb- were spicy and delicious . i ordered the chile relleno , and it came out super hot and covered in tons of cheese . i really enjoyed the flavors of it , and was sad that i could only eat about a third of the meal . the standard bean and rice sides were also really tasty and better than i 've had in a while . i will be definitely adding this place to my regular mexican restaurant rotation !		4		1
love this great new brunch place in old town . this is a tiny place but they can sure squeeze a lot of people in . i recently checked out this place with a friend on a sunday . the place was busy with tables but we choose to sit on the patio . with the hot arizona heat , it was too bad sitting at the bar . i would recommend installing some misters . the service was very good . we got our hibiscus mimosa and iced coffee within in minutes of sitting down . i went healthy for breakfast and tried the squeeze scramble . the scramble includes turkey sausage , egg whites , mushrooms and onions . i added country potatoes and an english muffin to the meal . my friend tried the grilled cheese with truffle fries . the truffle fries were amazing . i have no complaints with my visit at the morning squeeze and i hope to make many more visits . they have an extensive menu and i had a hard time making a decision on breakfast . i wish they would be open for dinner . i love having breakfast for dinner .		4		1
for far to long i put this place at the rock bottom of my brewery list in town , it seems that i was mistaken . many years had passed since my last visit here , and after an invite from some friends and a good tasting at the last yelp event i went in . we sat on the large patio to enjoy the great spring az weather , it also enable us to accommodated upwards for 20 people at our conjoined table . happy hour was in full effect $ 3.25 beers -lrb- in a mug -rrb- and $ 5 pizza 's and appetizers . i started off with a stout , it was nice full bodied not to bitter and with a rich head . i learned that each beer is made on site with their own local recipes for food i went with the margarita pizza -lrb- $ 5 on hh $ 10 normal -rrb- . to my surprised it was cooked in a open flame oven and it was almost a bianco style pizza , it had fresh motzrella , basil , tomatoes and pesto on it . it was pretty good but a bit low on the crust to topping ratio . service was decent for a large patio party too . happy hr is 3:30 pm - 6:30 pm & 9-close all days , give it a try		4		1
i went here for dinner a few days ago but for some reason did n't read my previous review before my visit so i forgot to order my dish ` double hot ' . i ordered the `` garlic '' with beef and brown rice . i ordered it hot but it was n't hot enough . next time for sure i 'm getting double hot . anyway , the dish had plenty of flavor , the meet was tender and the veggies fresh . it was very good and not too unhealthy . i do have 2 complaints though . 1 . why ca n't they get a soda fountain instead of service it in cans ? i drink a ton of diet coke and hate spending like $ 5 on each can they make me buy . wtf . 2 . our meals came out one at a time and i 'm not sure why . 10 minutes must have passed between when the first person of our group got their meal and when the last meal was received . were they cooked fresh one at a time ? was our waitress super super busy or super duper slow ? i just do n't know . anyway , as always , i can not wait to go back . i love the food and the service is always pretty good .		4		1
took mom for dinner monday night . this was the second time i took her here , and it 'll be the last ! guess tapino just is n't for her . out of the three small plates we shared , she only enjoyed the lamb kabob over quinoa -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- . it was the second-best dish of the three i enjoyed . i 'd wanted to try a glass of rose -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , since mom is a fan , but she was `` too tired '' to have wine , so i 'll have to bookmark that for next visit . we started w / the butternut squash ravioli w / sage butter -lrb- $ 8 ; mmm ... i adore brown butter and sage ... my mom , however , does n't -rrb- . i appreciated the sweet creaminess of the squash puree against the slight toothiness of the ravioli . the sage butter added just enough salt to the dish , while the toasted candied pecan bits on top added impeccable crunch ! how i wished i had all three pieces ! -lrb- she ate one and did n't even enjoy it ! how infuriating ! lol -rrb- the second dish we tried was the baked escargots w / butter , parsley , lemon , and puff pastry -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- . compared to the multi-faceted ravioli dish , this was a bit disappointing . while i enjoyed the textures that the snails and crunchy puff pastry offered -lrb- too crunchy , if you ask me ! those babies were bordering on hard ! where 's the `` puff ? , '' i ask . -rrb- , the butter and parsley treatment fell flat . mom again only had one . i believe there were 6 total . do n't misunderstand - i still ate all the rest ... i was hungry !! :d last , but not the least , came the skewer of lamb kabob -lrb- 3 pcs ; $ 9 -rrb- w / bell peppers and onions , served over cold saffron quinoa w / cucumber sauce -lrb- served on the side -rrb- . thankfully , the lamb pieces were savory enough not to have needed the sauce . loved the quinoa . check out the photos i took ... i 'll have to take a photo of the ravioli on my next visit !		4		1
i love this place ! we 've never been to greece or have had `` authentic '' greek food at a fancy restuarant but i have had falafal and gyros and new york city so i 'm basing my comparison on that and i think this place is pretty awesome . we used to love going to ararat 's mediterranean -lrb- sp ? -rrb- and now that it has closed , greek wraps is our new fave . it 's a ways drive for us since we live way out in buckeye but anytime we are out that direction , we almost always head to greek wraps . we 've had their falafel and gyro platters/wraps and enjoy them a lot . i think the falafael is a little on the crunchy side but i do n't know if it 's more authentic for it to be `` software '' or crunchy like they make it . their rice is good , too . my husband even picked up catering for his work crew and they all enjoyed it a lot , too . the service is pretty decent , too . nothing fancy but they greet you and help you out of you ever have any questions .		4		1
i have a serious crush on all pita jungles . they serve me absolutely delicious hummus and let 's be honest , i could probably finish off the entire serving by myself . oh wait , i have ! the hummus and chicken platter is one of my all-time favorites . however , it 's not the healthiest , so most times i try to go with the broiled chicken salad or one of the broiled chicken pitas . however , on a fat kid day , i love the philly cheesesteak pita or the chicken cheesesteak pita . i also enjoy the chicken lavosh without the garlic sauce and hummus as a substitute -lrb- see ? more hummus . i 'm obsessed -rrb- . just recently , i ordered the mediterranean chicken salad -lrb- trying to be healthy -rrb- and holy salad batman . this salad could quite easily feed a family of four . i got through about 1/10 of the salad before getting full and it looked like i had n't even started eating it . the salad also has enough flavor on its own that it does n't even need the dressing . if i were to order that salad again , i would share it and add an order of hummus on the side . i like this location because it 's convenient and a relatively healthy -lrb- and quick -rrb- option while on the go at the mall . i can run in and grab something to go or i can take a break from shopping and eat in the food court . i was very happy when they opened this location years ago and i definitely hope they stick around forever !		4		1
the tagline -lrb- and shiny new door handles -rrb- that say `` come together '' could n't be more appropriate for beckett 's table ... last night was only their fourth night open , and i 'm giving them a solid four stars . the becketts and partners scott and katie stephens did a remarkable job with the renovations of what used to be `` that 's italiano . '' the environment is extremely comfortable and warm . the staff was spot-on , starting with the hostesses . and throughout our meal , court , our server , made plenty of recommendations and answered all of our questions about the menu . we happened to see a handful of friendly faces and friends dining while we were there as well . we started off with the mac n cheese with pancetta and the oven roasted organic root vegetables -lrb- both a bargain at 5 dollars each -rrb- . next up was the romaine salad and brussel sprouts , which are not to be missed . the pickled golden beets in the romaine salad were unique and delicious , as were the hot appetizers and sides . when i could n't place one of the vegetables , court was right there with the answer for me : parsnips ! we paired our first course with the pilsbury `` one night stand '' rosé and liked it so much , we had another round . for our entrees , i had the blood orange glazed salmon and j went with the fork tender short ribs . both were large servings , especially the short ribs , and the description for these is perfect ; no knife needed . i actually liked the short ribs so much , that i ate more of that than i did the salmon , which had a bit too much orange glaze for me . as if that were n't enough food , we finished up with an order of the fig & pecan pie ... it is served with a cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream , the perfect sweet ending to our meal . the only suggestion that jared had for this course , was to also offer a root beer float . perhaps we 'll see that on the menu in the future ?! one funny thing about the evening was that they were out of the `` paté all the time , '' which was ok , as we can try it next time ! we will definitely be back to beckett 's table soon - i see it being a regular in our rotation of neighborhood spots for sure !		4		1
